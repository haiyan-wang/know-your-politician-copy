                     WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2021

                                       U.S. Senate,
        Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room 
SR-253, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Maria Cantwell, 
Chairwoman of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Cantwell [presiding], Klobuchar,

Young, Lee, Scott, and Lummis.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    The Chairwoman. The U.S. Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation will come to order. Good morning, everyone. 
Today, we are having a hearing on protecting consumer privacy. 
And we will hear from a panel of experts, three of whom have 
previously been on the front lines of fighting to protect 
consumer privacy at the primary agency charged with protecting 
consumers' privacy and data security, the Federal Trade 
Commission.
    We all know the challenges of the information age, and that 
they have brought us new products and services. But it has also 
exposed and threatened consumer privacy by unnecessarily 
collecting, storing, selling, and exposing consumers' most 
personal data to theft and harm. Every year for the past 5 
years, more than 140 million people have been affected by data 
breaches, exposing their personal data to thieves and 
fraudsters. And from July 2019 through July 2020, more than 
650,000 residents of my state, Washington, were victims of data 
breaches, including the release of their healthcare 
information, banking records, Social Security numbers, credit 
card information.
    Last week it was reported that Simon--last week it was 
reported that last May, Simon Eye, a U.S. chain of optometry 
clinics, had been data breached, exposing 144,000 individuals 
to sensitive--their sensitive data. This past April, the 
personal data of over 500 million Facebook users, including 
phone numbers, full names, locations, e-mail addresses, were 
posted in a hacking forum, 32 million records were from the 
United States, providing key information with people who would 
want to use those in various ways. And last June, Volkswagen 
announced a data breach and exposed phone numbers and e-mail 
addresses of 3.1 million Americans who had shopped for cars.
    So it isn't a surprise that all this data being stolen, 
exposed, that more people have become victims of identity 
theft. Identity theft complaints have increased 375 percent 
between 2017 and 2020. The harms are causing real damage to 
consumers. According to a May 2021 report by the Identity Theft 
Resource Center, victims of identity theft are turned down for 
loans, unable to rent houses. They have their credit damaged. 
They are billed for medical services they never received. Can't 
find unemployment benefits because their name was basically 
stolen.
    Our precise locations, fitness regimens, computer strokes, 
and even our friends and family networks have basically been 
turned into commodities. We know that recently The Wall Street 
Journal also found that even after you turn off some of your 
app tracking on your iPhone, iPhone apps can continue to track 
you using your device fingerprints. The fact is that companies 
collecting this information are not doing enough to safeguard 
and collect--the information that they collect or keep their 
privacy promises. Unfortunately, the Federal Trade Commission, 
which is tasked with preventing consumer data abuses, has not 
been given the resources to keep pace with this tech based 
economy.
    Professor Vladeck, we will hear from you, but I think you--
have in your opening remarks that basically now the FTC's 
docket is dominated by these technology issues. The truth is 
that our economy has changed significantly, and the Federal 
Trade Commission has neither the adequate resources nor the 
technological expertise at the FTC to adequately protect 
consumers from harm.
    While the Commission is responsible for keeping up with the 
latest technology companies in the world, according to today's 
testimony, ``it has fewer than 10 employees on staff with the 
right technology expertise.'' The FTC simply does not have the 
tools to fend off privacy attacks, data breaches, Internet 
scams, ransomware, digital abuses that threaten consumers and 
our economy. It is not to say the FTC hasn't done some good 
work. But when we look at the volume of what we are facing, it 
is clear you are under--they are underresourced.
    Even where the FTC has taken enforcement actions against 
companies, the companies continue to violate those FTC orders, 
which is beyond frustrating. Even though the FTC has been able 
to use their current authority of unfair and deceptive 
practices, companies like Facebook or others may gladly pay a 
$5 billion fine when actually they can still make over $70 
billion a year from some of these same practices. So, 
compliance. We need compliance. Compliance with existing laws 
or compliance with new rulemaking or compliance with a new 
privacy law will be insufficient if the FTC is not well 
resourced, technology sophisticated, and the policeman on the 
beat of the information age.
    The U.S. Department of Commerce estimated that the digital 
economy accounted for 9.6 percent of GDP in 2019, and it grows 
annually at a rate of 5.2 percent. This means we are just going 
to continue to be ever dependent on this economy. I am not even 
going to spend time talking about at length the great effect of 
State actors attacking our systems. The fact that we are--
consumers are less vulnerable to these events. But the economy 
of today is that--the digital economy generates $2 trillion 
annually. So it will continue to be a target. As the economy 
grows, the volume of data collected about Americans and the 
amount of data that will be stored is staggering.
    Last Congress, I introduced the Consumer Online Privacy Act 
alongside my colleague Schatz, and Klobuchar, Markey, that 
would have established a new privacy bureau at the FTC to serve 
as a consumer privacy watchdog. And I am pleased that the 
Budget Reconciliation Act that we are now considering in both 
the House and the Senate has a call for action here by giving 
$1 billion to the FTC to establish this bureau over 10 years, 
to hire the technologists, the data scientists, needed to keep 
pace with these digital threats. I know my Republican 
colleagues in the SAFE DATA Act also called for a similar 
amount of money to be spent by the FTC for privacy and data 
security.
    And as such, companies like Microsoft and others have 
called for greater investments. Today's witnesses, I know, will 
also underscore this need. Two of our witnesses, Professor 
David Vladeck and Ms. Maureen Ohlhausen have served in senior 
positions at the FTC and have been on the front lines of 
enforcement actions against companies that misused or neglected 
their security of personal data. We value their insights and 
how harm at the FTC--how harm can be done, and that tools and 
resources are needed at the FTC to hold companies accountable.
    Mr. Vladeck, in your written testimony, you said the Bureau 
of--New Privacy Investment Bureau could be a real game changer. 
Mr. Soltani, who is going to be joining us virtually, was one 
of the first technology experts hired by the FTC, and I know 
he's been sounding the alarm for years about the need to get 
the right resources, more technologists so the FTC can deliver 
more, so I look forward to asking him questions about that.
    And Mr. Reed, I was pleased to read your testimony, that 
you have a strong statement in support of first time civil 
penalty enforcements for the FTC in cases of privacy 
violations. So thank you all for being here. Thank you for all 
the work all of you have done on this important issue. And now 
I will turn it over to my friend and colleague, Senator Wicker, 
the Ranking Member, for his opening statement.

                STATEMENT OF HON. ROGER WICKER, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI

    Senator Wicker. Thank you, Senator Cantwell, for convening 
this hearing. And we do have a distinguished panel and I look 
forward to their testimonies. Last Congress, this committee 
heard from multiple stakeholders representing diverse views on 
how best to protect consumers' data privacy and security in the 
United States.
    We received testimony from current and former officials 
from the FTC, representatives from the business community, and 
academia, and privacy advocates who all testified about the 
vast economic and social benefits of data. They also spoke 
about the need for strong, clear, and consistent data 
protection rules for the Nation's job creators and about 
shortcomings in our existing data privacy and security laws. 
Since the full committee last convened on this topic over a 
year ago, the need for strong data privacy rules has become 
more urgent.
    In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of Americans 
have shifted their normal activities to online. This has 
resulted in more consumer data and personal information flowing 
throughout the economy than ever before. Without a national 
data privacy law in place, Americans will continue to face a 
growing risk of having their personal data exposed and 
potentially exploited. We are already seeing this happen. As 
the Chair has mentioned, earlier this year, the FTC reported 
that identity theft increased by almost 3,000 percent in 2020. 
Cyber-attacks and data breaches are also on the rise. Recent 
news reports show an uptick in exploitive data practices by 
social media targeting children and teens.
    And there are near daily accounts of entities misusing 
consumers' personal data or attempting to process their data in 
discriminatory ways. These developments are deeply troubling 
and further highlight the need for strong data protection 
rules. Without these safeguards, we risk losing consumers' 
trust in the Internet marketplace and undermining our national 
security and technological leadership abroad.
    Fortunately, Congress still has an opportunity to act to 
develop bipartisan national privacy legislation. In doing so, 
the United States would join more than 100 countries who 
already have a baseline privacy law, including China. In July, 
Senator Blackburn joined me in introducing a data privacy bill, 
the SAFE DATA Act, as a starting point to resume negotiations. 
And I am encouraged that this morning the Chair of this 
committee spoke favorably about a provision in that Act. Once 
again, I invite the Administration to work with Senator 
Cantwell and me to make a comprehensive data privacy law a 
reality.
    I call on the President to appoint someone, a specific 
person among his senior staff to be a liaison to Congress on 
this issue and to prioritize the enactment of a data privacy 
law this year. This is not only essential to a thriving digital 
economy, but it would also demonstrate to our allies around the 
world a serious and sincere commitment to the value of data 
protection as we seek to replace the EU, U.S. Privacy Shield, 
preserve transatlantic data flows, and enter into the new 
bilateral partnership on trade and technology.
    Today's hearing is an opportunity to discuss how to address 
certain issues in privacy legislation such as data security and 
enforcement. I hope our witnesses will speak to ways in which 
Congress can materially improve data security without imposing 
costly one size fits all mandates that would ignore an entity's 
unique data collection practices. I also hope witnesses will 
speak to what enforcement mechanisms offer the best way to 
ensure that requirements in privacy law are met and data 
protections are enforced. Last Congress, I proposed 
incorporating a narrow private right of action into a 
bipartisan privacy legislation, and I remain open to that idea.
    I welcome feedback from witnesses on how a narrow private 
right of action could be constructed without stifling 
innovation and marketplace competition or leading to 
unjustified financial windfalls for plaintiffs' attorneys. 
Today's hearing is also an opportunity to discuss how to ensure 
the FTC is properly resourced to enforce a data privacy law. I 
am sure witnesses will want to discuss what additional funding 
staff and technology expertise the Commission were required to 
enforce the law effectively.
    Finally, it is worth emphasizing that Congress, not the 
FTC, is responsible for developing a comprehensive national 
data privacy law. Only Congress can develop long-standing data 
protections for consumers that meaningfully safeguard their 
personal information. Anything short of Congressional action 
would create significant regulatory uncertainty for businesses 
and confuse consumers about the scope and durability of their 
privacy rights. Americans deserve to have their data protected. 
The time for Congress to act to pass Federal data privacy 
legislation is now. And I am--I can say that the Chair and I 
are united in that belief. I would like to take a moment to ask 
unanimous consent.
    I have here, Madam Chair, a letter signed by over 20 
associations representing hundreds of companies and 
organizations requesting that Congress pass a bipartisan 
national privacy law. I ask unanimous consent that they be 
entered into the record at this point.
    The Chairwoman. Without objection.

    Senator Wicker. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to 
these witnesses.
    The Chairwoman. Thank you, Senator Wicker, and thank you 
for that statement. I certainly want to agree with you. Happy 
to work with a point person from the Administration on this 
important policy. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention 
your great work on the European, U.S. data shield discussions. 
You have been a stalwart on this very important policy issue.
    And I think that it shows not only do we have to get our 
policies right, but that we are in a discussion with the world 
community about this growing economy as well. So thank you for 
that. And I very much appreciate your reminding me of your 
willingness to have a larger discussion about the private right 
of action. So, anyway, lots to--lots to do here. And so----
    Senator Wicker. Thank you.
    The Chairwoman.--I really appreciate those efforts. And so 
we will now turn to our witnesses. Mr. David Vladeck, Professor 
and Faculty Director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at 
Georgetown Law and Former Director of the Federal Trade 
Commission and Bureau of Consumer Protection. Welcome. Ms. 
Maureen Ohlhausen--am I saying that right? OK, good.
    Ohlhausen, Partner and Section Chair Baker Botts, Former 
Acting Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. Mr. Ashkan 
Soltani, who is joining us remotely, an Independent Researcher 
and Technologist, but former Chief Technologist for the Federal 
Trade Commission. And Mr. Morgan Reed, President of The App 
Association of Washington, D.C. So welcome to all of you. And 
we will start with you, Professor Vladeck.

            STATEMENT OF DAVID C. VLADECK, PROFESSOR

          AND FACULTY DIRECTOR, THE CENTER ON PRIVACY

        AND TECHNOLOGY, GEORGETOWN LAW; FORMER DIRECTOR,

                   FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION,

                 BUREAU OF CONSUMER PROTECTION

    Mr. Vladeck. Well, good morning, Chair Cantwell, and 
Ranking Member Wicker--and I was to say other members of the 
Committee. I am sure they will file in. I am David Vladeck. I 
am a Law Professor at Georgetown Law School. And as the Chair 
mentioned, I am the former Director of the Bureau of Consumer 
Protection at the Federal Trade Commission. I strongly support 
the legislation before Congress today. It would provide funding 
to the FTC to create a new technology center bureau to 
safeguard your constituents' privacy and data security.
    This proposal builds on the Chair's 2019 privacy bill, 
which also calls for a new technology bureau within the FTC. I 
support the legislation because it will begin to rectify the 
chronic underfunding and understaffing of the Federal Trade 
Commission. It started in 1980s, when the FTC's budget and 
staff allocations were literally cut in half. Since then, as 
both--both of you have mentioned, the Nation's gross domestic 
product has grown exponentially, and the FTC now enforces more 
than 50 additional laws than it did back in 1980.
    But today, the FTC is significantly smaller, both in terms 
of staffing and funding, than it was in 1980. As best as I can 
tell, that is not true for any other Federal agency. And 
because Federal budgets are based on prior year appropriations, 
the FTC is still lagging far behind its sister agencies, 
including, among others, the SEC, the CFPB, and the FCC. But 
unlike other agencies, the FTC pays for itself. The FTC almost 
invariably, year after year, returns more money to the Federal 
treasury than it gets. Why? Because FTC civil penalties, 
including, for example, the $5 billion penalty the FTC imposed 
on Facebook, goes straight to the Treasury.
    $5 billion would pay for more than 15 years of the FTC's 
budget. If the FTC were a company, we would all want to buy 
stock in it because it always generates more income than it 
spends. I urge you to pass this legislation to give the FTC the 
tools that it needs--desperately needs to fend off and punish 
privacy violations and other digital harms, from Internet scams 
and data breaches, to dark pattern manipulation and ransomware 
attacks. Without more resources, especially more technologists 
and engineers, the FTC will simply not be able to stem the 
growing tide of attacks on privacy and other digital harms.
    As a result, the cost to the United States will continue to 
vastly exceed the sums proposed in this legislation. Not 
enacting this bill would be penny wise and pound foolish. I 
know that some in this committee think funding and the creation 
of a new bureau should await Federal privacy legislation. I 
respectfully disagree. Your constituents are at risk today and 
that risk grows as privacy averse business models grow. Just 
read The Washington Post today about all of the Internet 
enabled tools in one's household that are all collecting 
enormous amounts of sensitive information over which your 
constituents have little control.
    Both of you talked about data breach. Well identity theft 
is the essentially predictable debris of an Internet economy 
that doesn't really care about data security. We still are 
plagued with, you know, with data breaches. So the FTC is 
really the only privacy cop on the beat. It is time that 
Congress gave it the tools it really needs to be in this fight. 
So thank you so much for inviting us here today. I am happy to 
answer any questions.

Consumer Protection, and co-founder and faculty director of Georgetown 
Law's Center on Privacy & Technology.
    I am here to explain why I strongly support the proposed 
legislation before the Committee today, which will provide funding for 
the Federal Trade Commission (``FTC'') to create a new technology-
centered Bureau that will focus on safeguarding your constituents' 
privacy and data security, and combatting other digital harms. This 
proposal builds on the Chair's 2019 privacy bill, which called for a 
new privacy, data security and technology bureau within the FTC.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ See Senate Bill No. 2968, 116th Congress, 1st Sess. Sec. 301 
(2019).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    *First, the proposed legislation will ameliorate, but not resolve, 
the chronic under-funding and under-staffing of the FTC. Even though 
the United States' gross domestic product (``GDP'') has grown at least 
four-fold since 1980,\2\ and even though the FTC now enforces eighty 
statutes in addition to the FTC Act, the FTC is significantly smaller 
today--in both funding and staffing--than it was in 1980. Passage of 
this legislation will be an urgently needed boost to the FTC's ability 
to fend off and punish privacy violations and other digital harms--from 
Internet scams and data breaches to dark pattern manipulation and 
ransom-ware attacks--that threaten businesses, government entities, and 
your constituents.\3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    *Second, the reality is that the FTC does not have adequate 
resources to safeguard online privacy and fight digital threats, 
notwithstanding the fact that the FTC remains the most effective 
enforcement agency in the world. The proposed legislation will help 
close the resource gap between the FTC and its sister law enforcement 
agencies. One measure of the resource gap is to compare the FTC's 
resources to those of its domestic and international counterparts. In 
every head-to-head comparison, whether it is with domestic agencies 
like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau, or foreign counterparts like the Irish, British, or 
French Data Protection authorities, the FTC loses, generally by a wide 
margin. Without more resources, the FTC will not be able to stem the 
growing tide of attacks on privacy and other digital harms, and the 
cost to the United States will continue to vastly exceed the sums 
proposed in this legislation.
    *Third, the FTC can create a new Bureau to focus on privacy and 
other digital threats without undermining the Bureau of Consumer 
Protection's ability to do its job of protecting consumers in the 
marketplace. My view (and I emphasize that I am not speaking for the 
FTC) is that the FTC would benefit from the creation of a new Bureau 
that would focus on safeguarding privacy and fighting digital harms. 
The funding authorized in this legislation would allow the FTC to hire 
and retain a critical mass of technologists, user experience designers, 
engineers, and other technical staff. The FTC has never had a cohort of 
technologists, a vacuum that has hindered the Commission's ability 
effectively to regulate the major tech companies. To round out a new 
Bureau, the FTC could transfer the Division of Privacy and Identity 
Protection (DPIP), which at present has 61 full time employees, almost 
all lawyers.\4\ The new Bureau would also need to bring in experts from 
the Divisions of Marketing Practices, Financial Practices and 
Enforcement, and work closely with other components of the Bureau of 
Consumer Protection, including the Division of Litigation Technology 
and Analysis.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    My point here is modest: There is plainly a path forward for the 
FTC to create a new Bureau that focuses on protecting privacy and 
combatting other digital harms, without undermining the Bureau of 
Consumer Protection's ability to do its job. Many senior FTC staff have 
advocated for the creation of a Bureau to focus on technology-related 
threats for some time, but given resource constraints, the FTC has been 
wary about doing so. The enactment of this legislation will give the 
FTC the tools to reorganize and devote greater resources to fighting 
digital harms.
I. The FTC Is Under-Funded and Under-Resourced
    The FTC's ever-growing statutory responsibilities, along with the 
growth of the economy, have long outstripped the Commission's ability 
to fully tackle the many missions Congress has assigned to it. This 
erosion started in the 1980s. Since then, the Commission's budget and 
staffing allocations shrank by nearly half. At the same time, the 
emergence of today's tech-driven economy has made the FTC's work far 
more complex, and issues relating to technology now dominate the 
Commission's docket.
    Notwithstanding these challenges, the FTC's domestic and 
international counterparts are better funded and staffed, especially 
when measured by their mission and scope. The proposed legislation, if 
enacted, will begin to address forty years of underfunding and 
understaffing, and thus help empower the FTC better to protect 
consumers in the digital age.
    The hard fact is that the FTC has never recouped from severe budget 
and staffing constrictions imposed throughout the 1980s. At its peak in 
1980, the FTC had a staff of 1,719 full-time equivalent (``FTE'') 
employees to enforce approximately thirty statutes.\5\ 1981 marked the 
beginning of a steady decline in the Commission's resources. In a 
seven-year span, the Commission's budget stalled out at $66 million, 
with its staff whittled down by almost half to a mere 894 FTEs by 
1989.\6\ Although there has been some growth in the last decade, the 
FTC still operated with only a $331 million budget and only 1,128 FTEs 
in Fiscal Year 2020 (``FY20'').\7\ This is less than two-thirds of the 
manpower and only a thirty percent greater budget than the Commission 
enjoyed forty years ago, yet today's FTC is charged with a much broader 
and complex mission than its predecessors. Prior budget increases have 
been modest, largely covering mandatory increases in staff compensation 
and infrastructure costs, not desperately needed improvements like 
hiring technologists and modernizing the Commission's technology.\8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While resources have been constrained, the Commission's 
responsibilities have expanded and continue to do so. Today's 
Commission has the responsibility of enforcing significantly more 
statutes than it did in 1980. In fact, since 1980, Congress has enacted 
more than fifty statutes that require the FTC to take action.\9\ The 
FTC currently enforces eighty-one antitrust and consumer protection 
laws, as well as the Federal Trade Commission Act.\10\ At the end of 
2020 alone, three new statutes were enacted tasking the Commission with 
additional administrative and enforcement duties.\11\ Not surprisingly, 
most of the responsibilities Congress has assigned to the Commission 
relate to privacy and data protection. A number of the post-1980 FTC 
statutes include important privacy laws such as the Children's Online 
Privacy Protection Act (``COPPA''), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the 
Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act 
of 2003 (``CAN-SPAM Act'').\12\ The FTC's privacy-related enforcement 
matters have accounted for more than 130 spam and spyware cases, over 
80 cases alleging privacy violations, more than 100 cases under the 
Fair Credit Reporting Act, and dozens of cases under Gramm-Leach-
Bliley, the COPPA, and other related privacy-protective statutes.\13\

    Not only have the Commission's statutory responsibilities expanded, 
but the U.S. economy has also grown exponentially. In 1980, the U.S. 
GDP totaled just under $3 trillion in today's dollars.\14\ Today, it 
totals about $21 trillion.\15\ And, with the exception of the recession 
years of 2008 and 2009 and the pandemic year of 2020, the American 
economy has reliably grown each year.\16\ Though we are still in the 
throes of our battle against COVID-19, both the Federal Reserve and the 
OECD project a 6 percent GDP growth rate for 2021, thanks in large part 
to Congressional interventions like the American Rescue Plan.\17\

    The booming technology sector, where FTC expertise and regulatory 
oversight are crucial, has contributed much to America's economic 
growth since the 1980s. Employment in the technology sector increased 
by 36 percent from 1990-2000, and by 20 percent from 2010-2015, nearly 
double total private sector expansion in the same window of time.\18\ 
Today, high-tech industries account for about 10 percent of all U.S. 
jobs and over 18 percent of U.S. output, with growth expected to 
continue at a faster rate than the overall occupational average.\19\

    As the tech sector grows, so too does the velocity of the 
integration of technology into our daily lives, underscoring the need 
not only for a well-resourced FTC, but for an FTC with specific and 
deep expertise in technology. The advance of laptops, tablets, 
smartphones, and other internet-connected devices, along with the near 
ubiquitous participation in social media, have resulted in the 
generation of unprecedented amounts of sensitive personal data--
including geolocation data, information about political affiliations, 
product preferences, and attitudes about virtually everything. Much of 
this personal data is constantly harvested, packaged, and sold and 
often resold. The commodification of sensitive personal data is a clear 
threat to consumer privacy and threatens other digital harms.\20\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To be sure, technologies like videoconferencing have sustained our 
personal, professional, and academic lives through the pandemic, 
keeping us connected and ``keeping the white-collar economy alive.'' 
\21\ But the FTC's enforcement action against Zoom underscores that 
threats to privacy and data security are ever-present, even with what 
seem to be innocuous technologies.\22\ The FTC faces a crucial and 
ever-increasing mission of keeping Americans safe from those who wish 
to exploit technology for harm or fail to take essential measures to 
safeguard data. The Committee's proposal would be a critical first step 
to ensure the FTC possesses sufficient capabilities to protect 
consumers as technologies continue to evolve.

II. Comparing the FTC to its Counterpart Agencies Demonstrates the 
        Depth of the Resource Gap
    It is hard to showcase the depth of the FTC's resource deficit in 
isolation. To drive the point home, consider the asymmetry between the 
FTC's mission and budget when compared to Federal agencies with 
similar, and in some cases narrower, statutory authority. Consider the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''), for example, which 
oversees securities trading on U.S. equity markets and enforces Federal 
securities law. To be sure, the SEC has a vital mission to perform, and 
I am not suggesting that its appropriation is too generous. But the 
SEC's annual budget is almost $2 billion and it has a staff of 
approximately 4,700 FTEs--that is, nearly six times the FTC's budget 
and four times the FTC's allocation of FTEs.\23\ The SEC's enforcement 
budget, standing alone, is nearly double that of the entire FTC.\24\ 
Even the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (``CFPB''), which has 
regulatory authority over certain consumer financial products and 
services, had a FY21 budget that exceeded the FTC's budget by almost 
$250 million and by nearly four hundred FTEs.\25\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There is also a significant salary gap between the FTC and other 
agencies that oversee financial regulation that jeopardizes the FTC's 
ability to retain top talent. FTC employees do not qualify for enhanced 
compensation under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and 
Enforcement Act (``FIRREA''). As a result, their salaries are not on 
par with similarly situated Federal employees working in financial 
regulation even though the FTC also works on complex investigations of 
and litigation against the world's largest corporations.\26\ And 
salaries at these corporations and the law firms that represent them 
dwarf those in government, which has helped tech giants, like Google, 
Facebook, Amazon and others, poach FTC staffers at a remarkable 
rate.\27\ Leveling FTC employees' salaries with their government 
counterparts would restore parity within government and help the FTC 
retain top talent, including technologists and engineers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The FTC's resources also pale in comparison to its international 
counterparts. Many of our European allies have created agencies to 
enforce privacy and data security protections--just a part of what the 
FTC does.\28\ For example, Ireland's Data Protection Commission 
(``DPC'') has 145 staff members, for a nation with a population around 
5 million.\29\ DPC Commissioner Helen Dixon said these resources are 
``vital for the DPC to continue to build its capacity as an 
internationally respected and effective supervisory authority.'' \30\ 
If the FTC had comparable staff proportional to the U.S. population of 
over 333 million, it would have over 9,600 staff dedicated just to 
privacy. The British Information Commissioner's Office (``OIC'') has 
more than 500 staff members.\31\ France's data protection authority 
(``CNIL'') has 255 staff members to protect a population of about 65 
million, and it is backed up by its sister agency, Inria (the French 
National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology), 
which has nearly 4,000 engineers on staff.\32\ That's a drastic 
difference given only 61 FTC staffers are dedicated to protecting the 
privacy of more than 333 million Americans. The resources of our 
foreign counterparts continue to grow in proportion to the need for 
privacy regulations while the FTC's resources remain static.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Increasing the FTC's budget is absolutely necessary. Even with its 
limited funding and staffing, the FTC continues to operate at a high 
level, as demonstrated by its recent order enforcement case against 
Facebook, which resulted in the strictest consent decree ever entered 
anywhere, as well as a record-breaking $5 billion penalty, and a steady 
stream of enforcement cases. But meeting the challenges of protecting 
consumers from privacy violations, data breaches, identity theft, and 
other digital harms requires an infusion of funding and staff. The FY22 
President's budget proposal is insufficient; its increase to $389 
million and 1,250 FTEs is a start, but still wholly inadequate. On the 
other hand, the proposed infusion of $1 billion for a new Bureau that 
focuses on digital privacy and cybersecurity can be a game-changer. I 
support this proposal because it will align the FTC's budget with the 
realities of today's tech-based economy, help restore the FTC to parity 
with its domestic and international counterparts, and better enable the 
FTC to perform its important mission of protecting consumers.
III. Funding Will Enable the FTC to Create a Bureau Focusing on 
        Fighting Digital Harms
    There is no question that if Congress enacts the pending 
legislative proposal the FTC will be able to create a new Bureau 
devoted to fighting against digital harms without hollowing out the 
Bureau of Consumer Protection (``BCP''). After all, there is plenty of 
work for a new Bureau to focus on technology and digital harms and BCP 
will still have an avalanche of consumer protection work to keep it 
fully engaged. I recognize that for government veterans, the word 
``reorganization'' is justifiably greeted with skepticism, alarm, or 
worse. But there is a difference where, as would be the case here, 
reorganization takes the form of adding substantial resources rather 
than simply re-allocating existing resources.
    In my view, the first and most important measure the FTC should 
take in standing up a new Bureau is to recruit and hire a critical mass 
of top-notch technologists. As far as I know, the FTC has never been 
able to have more than ten technologists on staff at any given time 
(and probably far fewer), and the small cohort has made it difficult 
for the FTC to retain technologists. The FTC likely needs several 
multiples of ten to ensure that the FTC has the expertise to regulate 
the major tech companies. And a critical mass of technologists is 
essential for several reasons, including instilling camaraderie and 
information sharing, enabling the Bureau to engage in multiple 
investigations simultaneously, helping staff with Section 6(b)\33\ 
investigations, and giving the technologists time to keep up with 
emerging technologies and to conduct and publish research.\34\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \33\ 15 U.S.C. 46(b).
    \34\ Having in-house experts would substantially bolster the 
effectiveness of the FTC's enforcement cases, regardless of whether the 
cases are brought before the Administrative Law Judge or a Federal 
court. For instance, in FTC v. Commerce Planet, a case that spanned 18 
trial days, the FTC retained an expert on human computer interaction 
(in other words, user experience) to testify that the company's 
disclosures were designed to be obscured and were misleading. In ruling 
for the FTC, the District Court Judge said that ``the Court finds the 
expert testimony of Jennifer King to be on-point and persuasive,'' 
sealing the FTC's win. FTC v. Commerce Planet, 878 F. Supp. 2d 1048, 
1068 (C.D. Cal. 2012), aff'd, 815 F.3d 593 (9th Cir. 2016). Because of 
the expense of hiring outside experts, the FTC rarely does so in 
consumer protection cases.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To fully staff the new Bureau, the 61 staff currently assigned to 
BCP's Division of Privacy and Identity Protection would be transferred 
to the new Bureau. The new Bureau would also need to recruit a few 
experienced lawyers from several BCP Divisions, including Marketing 
Practices, Financial Practices, Enforcement, and Litigation Technology 
and Analysis. I assume that those Division would be able to replace 
lost staff.
    A fully staffed new Bureau could also make critical changes to the 
way the FTC enforces the law. For one thing, the new Bureau could 
engage in real-time oversight of the tech companies to understand what 
they are actually doing in the marketplace, enabling the new Bureau of 
be pro-active in ways the FTC cannot undertake today. For another, 
having an in-house complement of technologists would enable the FTC to 
undertake simultaneously multiple investigations that require technical 
assistance, especially in investigations into data breaches, spyware, 
the Internet of Things, and the misuse of personal information. For yet 
another, the new Bureau could take over the responsibility of 
monitoring existing consent decrees involving tech companies, to ensure 
that the companies adhere to the requirements of the decrees, and if 
there are defaults, to help decide whether the FTC should launch an 
investigation or pursue an enforcement action.
    And last, but hardly least, the new Bureau will have the authority, 
subject to Commission approval, to significantly modify the FTC's 
orders against tech companies. Due to resource constraints, FTC privacy 
orders require the company to hire a third-party assessor to conduct 
periodic audits. Section VIII of the FTC's 2019 Order Modifying Prior 
Decision and Order for Facebook lays out what is now the standard 
practice of requiring the company to hire an assessor, subject to the 
FTC's approval, to submit an initial assessment within six months, and 
thereafter submit biennial assessments.\35\ But the FTC adopted the 
practice of using outside assessors in privacy cases mainly because of 
the resource constraints I have catalogued above. The new Bureau may 
choose to play a far more active, direct role in overseeing tech 
companies subject to FTC orders, and may, for example, require more 
frequent and robust exchanges between the FTC and the company so the 
FTC, in real-time, can assess whether the company is in fact in 
compliance with the FTC's order.\36\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \35\ https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/
c4365facebookmodifyingorder.pdf.
    \36\ I should acknowledge that I was the Director of the FTC's 
Bureau of Consumer Protection when the Commission was crafting the 
initial orders in the Facebook and Google cases. Because of resource 
constraints, there was no discussion that the FTC should take on the 
front-line role of assessing the companies' ongoing compliance with the 
orders. For that reason, the FTC relied on third-party independent 
assessments; the utility of those assessments is subject to debate. 
There is no question that the assessments have worked reasonably well 
in the seventy or so data breach cases the FTC has brought.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 * * *
    Let me end by making a few additional points that are not part of 
the pending legislation but are issues Congress must tackle if the FTC 
is going to fulfill its mission of safeguarding consumer privacy.
    First, the FTC needs ordinary notice and comment rulemaking 
authority under Section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act; 
without it, the FTC has no choice but to make policy through 
enforcement cases, a process that is slow, resource-intensive, and does 
not necessarily yield clear-cut standards.\37\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \37\ I recently testified in favor of House Bill 4447 before the 
House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Consumer 
Protection and Commerce, which would restore to the FTC notice and 
comment rulemaking authority. See https://energycommerce.house.gov/
sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/
WitnessTestimony_Vladeck_CPC_2021.07.28.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Second, the FTC needs initial fining authority, especially in cases 
involving digital harms. Companies should not get a free pass on 
privacy violations. Under existing law, however, the only remedy for a 
first violation is a consent order, not a fine, and not redress, not 
just because of the Supreme Court's ruling in AMG v. FTC, but because 
the currency in privacy violations is the misuse of sensitive personal 
data, which, unlike money, cannot be refunded or restored.
    Third, the statutory tools the FTC has available are not sufficient 
to provide robust protection for consumers against digital harms, 
including privacy harms. The commands of Section 5 the FTC Act--that 
the FTC ``prevent'' ``unfair and deceptive practices'' in the 
marketplace--are not, in themselves, sufficient to create a meaningful 
legal regime that safeguards consumers. To be sure, the Act provides 
substantial ammunition for the Commission to bring enforcement cases 
for many kinds of egregious privacy harms; ammunition that the 
Commission has used against most of the major technology companies. But 
Section 5 cannot restrain more insidious practices that go beyond 
unfairness and deception, and Congress needs to enact a comprehensive 
privacy law or delegate greater power to the FTC to combat digital 
harms.\38\

STATEMENT OF MAUREEN K. OHLHAUSEN, PARTNER AND SECTION CHAIR OF 
   ANTITRUST AND COMPETITION LAW, BAKER BOTTS; FORMER ACTING 
               CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION

    Ms. Ohlhausen. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Cantwell, and 
Ranking Member Wicker, and the other distinguished members of 
this Committee for the opportunity to testify at this important 
hearing examining how to protect consumer privacy. As you have 
already noted, I am Maureen Ohlhausen. I am a Partner at the 
law firm of Baker Botts, and I also had the pleasure of serving 
as an Acting Chairman and Commissioner at the Federal Trade 
Commission, our Nation's leading consumer protection agency.
    As the collection, use, and sharing of personal data has 
continued to grow, the FTC is reaching the limits of its 
current tools, and consumers and businesses are increasingly 
required to navigate a tangle of confusing and often 
inconsistent privacy requirements from various levels of 
Government. And to safeguard consumer privacy in today's 
environment, Congress needs to enact a comprehensive national 
privacy law. And that is why it is paramount that members of 
this committee return to the bipartisan negotiations conducted 
in the previous Congress. A new law should have several 
components.
    First, legislation should provide consumers clarity and 
visibility into companies' data collection use and sharing 
practices, as well as choices regarding these practices 
calibrated to the sensitivity of that data. Second, legislation 
should provide a national and uniform set of protections and 
consumer rights throughout our digital economy. Third, it 
should ensure strong enforcement that protects consumers from 
harmful data practices while allowing companies to provide 
innovative products and services that consumers want. And while 
though some have raised the possibility of the FTC undertaking 
a privacy rulemaking under its current general unfair and 
deceptive authority, I am concerned that a potential FTC 
privacy rulemaking may actually distract from focusing on 
achieving these key objectives through legislation.
    And there are several potential problems with an FTC 
rulemaking. First, the scope of an FTC rulemaking under the 
agency's current UDAP authority is much more limited than what 
Congress can achieve statutorily. For example, the requirement 
of access and correction rights for consumers, which we have 
seen in a number of proposed bills, is likely not supportable 
under the FTC's current general authority. And some of my 
fellow panelists have acknowledged the limitations of the FTC's 
current authority in their testimony.
    Second, an FTC rulemaking may not preempt State laws and 
regulations, even conflicting State requirements. Thus, an FTC 
rulemaking could simply produce a 50 first set of privacy 
requirements rather than a single national framework that 
applies no matter where consumers live, work, shop, or visit. 
And this would lead to even more consumer and business 
confusion and a fragmenting of consumer rights. And it would 
also be particularly burdensome on smaller firms that lack the 
resources to deal with such regulatory complexity.
    Third, Congress put significant limitations in place for 
FTC UDAP rulemaking absent specific guidance to the contrary. 
And where Congress has enacted specific privacy laws such as in 
the areas of children's privacy and credit reporting, it has 
given the FTC notice and comment APA rulemaking authority to 
implement clear statutory direction. Absent such clear 
statutory guidance and streamlined rulemaking authority, the 
FTC must proceed under the more deliberate Magnuson Moss 
process, which will slow the implementation of consumer 
protections that are widely supported by Congress.
    Now, there is no question that a strong privacy law needs 
to include strong FTC authority to protect consumers' rights. A 
single Federal privacy law that gives the FTC more enforcement 
authority will dramatically strengthen consumer protections. 
And it should authorize the FTC to fine companies for certain 
first time violations, and in certain cases to issue rules to 
keep up with developments in technology. It should also give 
the FTC more resources. State AGs should be given the power to 
enforce any new Federal law. And a consumer privacy law, 
though, should not include private rights of action with 
punitive or statutory damages that would primarily benefit 
lawyers and result in class actions that provide little, if 
any, relief to actual victims.
    Giving the FTC specific authority to provide consumer 
redress would be an effective way to enable consumers to be 
compensated directly and promptly when companies engage in 
harmful data practices. So thank you again for the opportunity 
to testify today, and I look forward to working with the 
Committee and all stakeholders to craft strong national privacy 
legislation.

   Prepared Statement of Maureen K. Ohlhausen, Former Acting Chair, 
                        Federal Trade Commission
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Wicker, and other distinguished 
Members of this Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify at 
this important hearing examining how to better protect consumer 
privacy. My name is Maureen Ohlhausen, and I am a partner at the law 
firm Baker Botts L.L.P. I had the pleasure of serving as an FTC 
Commissioner (2012-2018) and Acting Chairman (2017-2018).
    The FTC is our Nation's leading consumer privacy protection agency. 
It has brought hundreds of privacy-and data security-related 
enforcement actions, covering both on-and offline practices and fast-
evolving technologies.\1\ The FTC has creatively used every 
enforcement, policy, and educational tool at its disposal in its 
privacy and data security work to protect consumers' personal 
information, while still allowing consumers to enjoy the benefits of 
the many innovative products offered in today's dynamic marketplace. 
However, as the collection, use, and sharing of personal data have 
continued to grow in amount and complexity, consumers and businesses 
are now required to navigate a tangled web of confusing, and often 
inconsistent, data privacy requirements from various levels of 
government, and from various nations and regions throughout the world.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While I am proud of the FTC's privacy and data security enforcement 
efforts, the agency currently operates under several material 
constraints that limit the FTC's effectiveness absent further action by 
Congress. You and your colleagues can remove these constraints by 
enacting comprehensive, technology neutral, national privacy 
legislation that provides clear protections for consumers, articulates 
specific limits on companies' ability to collect, use, and share 
sensitive personal information, and grants the FTC the resources and 
explicit authority necessary to enforce a new law.
    I would like to address what I view as reasons why reliance on the 
FTC's current authority cannot provide the same benefits as a Federal 
privacy law. First, with the exception of discrete areas such as 
children's privacy and fair credit reporting, the FTC lacks explicit 
authority to enforce statutory privacy requirements or promulgate 
privacy regulations. Section 5 of the FTC Act gives the agency the 
authority to prevent certain entities from ``using . . . unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce'' (``UDAP''). This 
language has rightly been interpreted to permit the FTC to police 
unfair or deceptive privacy and data security practices, but it does 
not provide the clear statutory guidance found in other laws. For 
example, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the FTC can impose 
affirmative obligations on entities to provide rights of access to and 
correction of data. These rights would also be available under Federal 
privacy legislation introduced by Members of this Committee. But the 
FTC likely could not impose such obligations based on its UDAP 
authority alone.
    Second, the FTC's ability to promulgate rules under its broad UDAP 
authority is governed by a special process in the Magnuson-Moss 
Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act. Congress set up this 
process specifically to cabin the agency's broad UDAP authority by 
imposing additional procedural requirements and other protections.\2\ 
By contrast, where Congress has provided the agency with detailed 
statutory guidance on subject matter and goals, it has expressly 
permitted the FTC to use Administrative Procedure Act notice-and-
comment rulemaking, and specifically exempted the agency from the 
additional procedures of Magnuson-Moss rulemaking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ Magnuson-Moss Warranty--Federal Trade Commission Improvement 
Act, Pub. L. No. 93-637, Sec. 202, 88 Stat. 2183, 2193 (1975) (codified 
as amended at 15 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 45-46, 49-52, 56-57c, 2301-2312 
(2012)); 15 U.S.C. Sec. 57a(a)(1)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Third, an FTC rulemaking under existing authority may not 
necessarily preempt state laws. If the FTC does not preempt state laws, 
this would permit the continued proliferation of disparate state 
requirements, and would make a coherent, consistent national framework 
nearly impossible. In addition, there will inevitably be a conflict 
between an FTC rulemaking and the increasing number of state laws and 
rulemakings, which will create confusion with respect to what 
requirements apply, and will further fragment U.S. privacy protections.
    Simply put, the FTC's existing framework is not conducive to 
adopting comprehensive, national consumer privacy and data security 
requirements in a manner that can provide the clarity and certainty 
consumers and businesses seek. That is why I respectfully request that 
Congress turn its focus back to enacting privacy legislation.
    Last year, I testified before this committee in support of 
Congressional efforts to enact comprehensive Federal privacy 
legislation. The events of the past year make the need for such 
legislation even more apparent. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have 
seen a rapid shift to online work and learning, as well as the 
deployment of technological efforts to track the path of the virus. The 
California Consumer Privacy Act (``CCPA'') went into effect in 2020, 
but the landscape continues to shift, as California's ballot initiative 
(the California Privacy Rights Act) amended the CCPA, and Virginia and 
Colorado enacted their own consumer privacy laws.
    These developments reinforce the need for Federal action. Congress 
needs to act quickly, and I urge the Leadership and Members of this 
Committee to continue to take important steps in that direction.
    I realize that there are still points of contention with respect to 
privacy legislation. However, what we all have in common is a desire 
for clear consumer privacy protections that apply throughout the Nation 
based on the sensitivity of the data, and which allow consumers to 
continue to benefit from innovative technologies, such as those we have 
come to rely on even more heavily during this pandemic. We want 
consumers to enjoy confidence that their personal information is not 
subject to varying protections within a state or from state to state, 
regardless of the entity that collects such information, based on the 
sensitivity of the data and how it is used.\3\

to the Progressive Policy Institute, Key Findings from Recent National 
Survey of Internet Users (May 26, 2016), https://
www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Internet-User-
National-Survey-May-23-25-Key-Findings-Memo.pdf (finding that 94 
percent of consumers favor such a consistent and technology-neutral 
privacy regime, and that 83 percent of consumers say their online 
privacy should be protected based on the sensitivity of their online 
data, rather than by the type of Internet company that uses their 
data). See also https://www.progressivepolicy.org/press/press-releases/

data, whether it be search engines, social networks, or ISPs, and they

collected' said Peter Hart.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I support strong consumer privacy rights and believe firmly in 
providing transparency and control to consumers, robust security, and 
strong accountability as outlined in the FTC's bipartisan 2012 landmark 
Privacy Report.\4\ Further, as someone who has also focused on the 
intersection of antitrust and privacy law, and the impact of regulation 
of market competition, I urge that a federal approach be technology-
neutral and avoid unduly burdening smaller entities, innovative 
services, or certain entities in the Internet ecosystem.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Elements of an Effective Federal Framework
    I strongly believe that Congress needs to enact Federal privacy 
legislation that includes several key attributes. First, legislation 
should provide a national and uniform set of protections and consumer 
rights throughout our digital economy. Second, it should ensure strong 
enforcement that protects consumer information that could result in 
harm if disclosed or misused, while also allowing companies to provide 
and develop innovative products and services that consumers want. 
Third, it should provide consumers clarity and visibility into 
companies' data collection, use, and sharing practices, as well as 
easily understandable choices regarding these practices, calibrated to 
the sensitivity of that data. Fourth, legislation should be more 
comprehensive than current state laws, such as the CCPA, addressing 
more elements of the data cycle. Fifth, Federal privacy legislation 
should be enforced by the FTC, which has the experience and skill to 
meaningfully enforce a new law's protections, supplemented by state 
attorneys general (``AGs'').
1. Provide a national and uniform set of protections and consumer 
        rights
    Federal legislation should be technology-neutral and apply to all 
entities across the Internet ecosystem that collect, share, or make use 
of consumer data, whether they are technology companies, broadband 
providers, or retailers. What matters is not who collects the data, but 
what data is collected, how sensitive it is, and how it is protected 
and used.
    Strong privacy protections need to apply to consumers regardless of 
where in the United States they live, work, or happen to be accessing 
information. By its very nature, the Internet connects individuals 
across state lines. Data (and, increasingly, commerce) knows no state 
boundaries. For this reason, a proliferation of different state privacy 
requirements creates inconsistent and confusing privacy protections for 
consumers, as well as significant compliance and operational challenges 
for businesses of all sizes. Although privacy regulation is often 
justified by concerns about big online players having large amounts of 
consumer information, regulatory complexity actually works to favor 
large, established companies.\5\ It also erects barriers to the kind of 
innovation and investment that is a lifeblood of our Nation's economy 
and to many beneficial and consumer-friendly uses of information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ See, e.g., Jian Jia, Ginger Zhe Jin, Liad Wagman, ``The Short-
Run Effects of GDPR on Technology Venture Investment'' (working paper, 
National Bureau of Economic Research, November 2018), https://
www.nber.org/papers/w25248).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Protect consumer information that could result in harm if disclosed 
        or misused
    A Federal privacy law should protect individuals' information, the 
use or disclosure of which could result in harm. Accordingly, such 
legislation should cover data that identifies an individual, whereas 
data that does not identify an individual poses a minimal risk of harm 
and need not be subject to the same requirements.
    Sensitive personal information, such as health and financial 
information, real-time precise geo-location information, social 
security numbers, and children's information, poses the highest risk of 
consumer harm and should be subject to the highest protections.\6\ In 
turn, to mirror consumer expectations and preferences, there should be 
less-stringent requirements on non-sensitive personally identifiable 
information, reflecting the lower risk of consumer harm. Information 
that is reasonably de-identified, aggregated, or publicly available 
does not raise the same specter of harm and falls outside the scope of 
necessary consumer protections.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ These types of information reflect a general consensus, as 
recognized in the FTC's 2012 report, supra note 4 at 58-59. Other types 
of information may be sensitive, as reflected in consumer expectations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Reflect consumer preferences through simple choices based on data 
        sensitivity
    I believe that an optimal approach would balance ease of use and 
transparency by giving consumers clear and simple privacy choices based 
on the nature of the relevant information itself--its sensitivity and 
the correlated risk of consumer harm if such information is the subject 
of an unauthorized disclosure. A Federal privacy law should promote 
consumer control and choice by imposing requirements for obtaining 
meaningful consent based on the risks associated with different kinds 
and uses of consumer data.
    As I discussed earlier, sensitive data should be afforded stronger 
protections under a Federal privacy law than non-sensitive personally 
identifiable data and non-identifiable information. In line with this 
concept, the most sensitive data should be subject to an opt-in consent 
requirement, while other personally identifiable covered data would be 
suitably protected by opt-out consent. Further, for certain types of 
routine operational uses, such as order fulfillment, fraud prevention, 
network management, and some forms of first-party marketing, consent 
should be inferred, consistent with consumer expectations.
4. Legislation should be more comprehensive than current state laws
    Federal privacy legislation should address gaps and shortcomings of 
current privacy laws. A strong Federal privacy law should build on 
elements of current efforts in California, Virginia, and Colorado, and 
include safeguards protecting uses of consumer data throughout the 
United States.
5. Ensure strong accountability and enforcement that best protects 
        consumer interests
    The Members of this Committee recognize that Congress must develop 
a law that guarantees strong privacy rights to consumers and adopts 
best practices from state laws, while creating uniformity across the 
Nation. But preempting state laws should not mean weakening protections 
for consumers. A Federal privacy law needs to be a strong one. I 
believe that states, as well as the FTC, have a critical role to play 
in protecting and enforcing those rights.
    The FTC should have the primary authority to enforce a national 
privacy law. The FTC is already protecting consumer privacy, making it 
experienced and knowledgeable in the field. Moreover, it is well-
equipped to assess the interaction between competition and privacy law 
in the United States. Congress should make use of these existing 
strengths, rather than start from scratch with a newly-formed, and 
inexperienced, agency.
    Federal privacy legislation should support strong enforcement by 
the FTC, allowing the agency to obtain meaningful results. Rather than 
being limited to violations of previous orders, the FTC needs to be 
able to fine companies for first-time violations of a new, 
comprehensive privacy law to provide sufficient incentives for 
companies to take the necessary steps to ensure responsible use and 
protection of consumer data.
    However, as I discussed earlier, as privacy concerns become 
weightier and more complex, the FTC is reaching the limits of its 
current tools--which it has made clear in its statements, including 
those made before the Committee.\7\ Congress must provide the FTC with 
greater statutory clarity coupled with more resources to protect 
consumer privacy in America.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ See, e.g., Fed. Trade Comm'n, FTC Report on Resources Used and 
Needed for Protecting Consumer Privacy and Security (2020), https://
www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/reports-response-senate-
appropriations-committee-report-116-111-ftcs-use-its-authorities-
resources/p065404reportresourcesprivacydatasecurity.pdf; Oversight of 
the Federal Trade Commission, supra note 1 at (``Section 5, which we 
use to bring our general privacy and data security cases, is not 
without its limitations.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Despite the ever-growing need for privacy enforcement, the FTC's 
budget has been flat since 2013. The number of full-time employees lags 
behind where it was in the early 1980s and comparable bodies tasked 
with data protection.\8\ Meanwhile, the Internet and the collection, 
use, and sharing of consumer data have grown enormously. I urge 
Congress to address that widening gap to meaningfully support an issue 
as important and complicated as consumer privacy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ Id. at 2-3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I recognize that state AGs are critical allies in the realm of 
consumer protection. They should be given the power to enforce any new 
Federal law, taking on violations that the FTC is yet to investigate or 
that have a particular impact in their respective state. By working in 
unison, the FTC and state AGs can create an efficient process that 
reduces duplicative matters and supports consistency for all consumers.
    A Federal privacy law, though, should not include private rights of 
action with statutory or punitive damages. These approaches often 
result in class actions that primarily benefit attorneys, while 
providing little, if any, relief to those who are harmed. Private 
rights of action may also lead to abuses, such as frivolous assertions 
and attempts to seek ``nuisance fee'' settlements. This results in the 
diversion of company resources from compliance to litigation, which 
ultimately does not help consumers who, at the end of the day, simply 
want companies to follow the law. Like state law preemption, trusting 
enforcement to the FTC and state AGs fosters consistency, and is 
ultimately more beneficial to consumers.
    Providing the FTC and state AGs with clear privacy protections, 
backed up with strong enforcement authority and expanded resources, 
represents a highly beneficial approach for consumers, as evidenced by 
the successful and bipartisan work in policing violations of children's 
privacy through the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Providing 
the FTC with enhanced authority to facilitate consumer redress for 
privacy violations would also ensure that consumers can be compensated 
directly and promptly when companies engage in harmful data practices.
Conclusion
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today. I look 
forward to working with all Members of the Committee and all 
stakeholders in crafting strong national privacy legislation.

    The Chairwoman. Thank you very much, Ms. Ohlhausen. Now we 
are going to hear remotely from Mr. Ashkan Soltani, Independent 
Researcher and Technologist, former Chief of the Federal Trade 
Commission.

            STATEMENT OF ASHKAN SOLTANI, INDEPENDENT

              RESEARCHER AND TECHNOLOGIST; FORMER

          CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION

    Mr. Soltani. Hello there. Can you hear me alright?
    The Chairwoman. Yes.
    Mr. Soltani. Perfect. Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member 
Wicker, and members of this committee, thank you for inviting 
me to appear today. My name is Ashkan Soltani. I am a 
researcher and technologist, formerly Chief Technologist at the 
FTC. Since departing FTC, I have helped support State level 
privacy and tech enforcement, both as an expert and through my 
involvement through Georgetown law, where I am a distinguished 
fellow at the Institute of Law and Policy and the Center of 
Privacy and Technology.
    I also helped author California's landmark privacy laws, 
the CCPA and the CPRA, Prop 24 which California voters 
enthusiastically passed last year. I have seen firsthand the 
challenges of crafting and enforcing laws that constrain bad 
behavior in the current digital ecosystem. I am pleased to be 
invited as Congress and this committee are considering 
significant changes to the structure and funding of the FTC. 
The proposal to create and fund a new bureau at the FTC is a 
strong step forward and providing the Commission with the 
resources it needs desperately to effectively protect consumers 
in the digital economy.
    A new bureau focused on technology and data protection 
would help the FTC support its mission of policing unfair and 
deceptive trade practices related to privacy, data security, 
identity theft, and data abuses. I have submitted my written 
testimony for the record, but I would like to highlight three 
key points which I hope will inform the discussion today. One 
is that the FTC is critically under-resourced to oversee the 
Nation's myriad of privacy and cybersecurity issues. With a 
bare bones staff of about 40 attorneys and a handful of 
technologists, their researchers pale in contrast to their 
counterparts in other countries.
    The German DPA, for example, has 745 staff and nearly 100 
tech experts enforcing their laws for a country one-quarter of 
the population in the US. Similarly, France, which has one-
fifth of our population employs nearly 200 staff, including 30 
tech experts. The research problem is exasperated when 
businesses choose to litigate a case rather than accept a 
settlement. By some accounts, litigation can occupy one-third 
to one-half of the Commission's entire privacy division on a 
single matter. That is the entire Federal--that is half of the 
entire Federal privacy staff working on one case for years at 
the exclusion of other critical work.
    Similarly, the FTC Bureau of Enforcement is tasked with 
overseeing compliance with all of the hundreds of FTC consent 
decrees, in addition to a myriad of obscure laws relating to, 
for example, Made in the USA and textile labeling. The same 
lawyers who ensure that social media companies have robust 
privacy and data security programs are also making sure the 
labels on bed linens are correct. In fact, many of the big tech 
companies which this Congress is presently concerned with, such 
as Facebook, Apple, Google and others, are already under a 
consent decree with the Commission.
    But the FTC has limited resources to adequately monitor 
that these firms are complying with the terms of their order. 
One former FTC enforcement staff has publicly stated the FTC 
rarely even reads the third party assessments provided to it. 
Additionally, the FTC doesn't need just more resources. It 
needs the right resources. Technology and data provides--
pervades nearly every aspect of today's online marketplace. 
Data security, data abuse, identity theft all have one thing in 
common, technology and the underlying data they rely on.
    Narrowly constraining the new bureau to solve only one of 
those problems, privacy, would fall short of the consumer 
protection goals laid out by FTC and this Congress. I suggest 
instead Congress support the creation of the Bureau of 
Technology and Data Protection. This may seem like a small 
point, but names do matter. As I said before, most harms don't 
concern just privacy but data, data abuse. I have long 
advocated for the creation of a new Bureau of Technology with 
the mission and expertise to investigate harmful practices 
across the technology ecosystem.
    This new bureau would provide a hub of resources that would 
serve across the agency's many consumer protection missions, 
incentivize collaborations, and encourage efficiency, similar 
to how BE functions across division. Alongside the funding, 
Congress should take steps to ensure that the Commission hires 
a wide range of staff to this bureau outside of just 
traditional lawyers, economists, and even technologists like 
myself. Importantly, the agency should hire statisticians, UX 
designers, social scientists, and behavioral researchers such 
as experts in child development who can guide the complex cases 
that come before them across a myriad of technology issues, 
such as dark patterns, and manipulative design, and algorithmic 
discrimination.
    Finally, in addition to more resources, I support my 
panelist's call that the FTC needs additional legal authority 
to meet the challenges of the digital economy. By expanding the 
Commission's budget is a great first step, this Congress should 
complement that funding with additional privacy authority so 
that the agency can fulfill its mission. This is why it is 
critical that this Congress pass Federal privacy legislation 
that builds upon but does not preempt privacy legislation 
adopted in states like California and Colorado.
    I am happy to go into what attributes of such legislation 
should look like, but based on my experience in California, the 
most critical is the ability to allow experimentation in the 
states as we seek to find the appropriate approach to the 
complexities of the digital ecosystem. Thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today. I am excited to work with you all 
on helping to solve these challenges.

    Since departing the FTC, I've helped support state-level privacy 
and tech enforcement, both directly as an expert, and through my 
involvement with Georgetown Law, where I am a Distinguished Fellow at 
both the Institute for Technology Law & Policy and the Center on 
Privacy and Technology. I also helped author California's landmark 
privacy laws, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the 
California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). I have seen firsthand the 
challenges in bringing cases against technology companies and making 
new laws to constrain bad behavior.
    Today, I'd like to discuss why the FTC needs expanded authority to 
handle data and technology matters, how to appropriately expand the 
Commission's staff and talent pool, and why it is important that any 
new bureau have a specific mandate to investigate new technologies and 
harmful data practices that pervade the modern digital ecosystem.
Expanding FTC Authority
    I'm pleased to be invited as Congress and this Committee are 
considering significant changes to the structure and funding of the 
Federal Trade Commission. The proposal to create and fund a new bureau 
at the FTC--which Chair Cantwell also called for in S. 2968, the 
Consumer Privacy Rights Act--is a strong step forward towards providing 
the Commission with the resources it needs to effectively protect 
consumers in the digital economy. A new bureau focused on technology 
and data protection would help the FTC support its mission of policing 
unfair and deceptive practices related to privacy, data security, 
identity theft, and data abuses. I strongly support it.
    First and foremost, in addition to more resources, the agency 
desperately needs additional legal authority to meet the new challenges 
of the digital economy. With the exception of a few sectoral laws, such 
as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) or the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) there is no comprehensive Federal privacy 
regime in the United States. We're long overdue for a change.
    Many of the digital harms from the surveillance economy are 
monitored through the FTC's enforcement of deceptive practices under 
Section 5 of the FTC Act. But this framework does not effectively 
protect consumers. For example, consumers often don't directly interact 
with the hundreds of data brokers that surreptitiously collect their 
data as they move about their digital lives. This ecosystem makes the 
required ``notice'' component of a deception case difficult to prove. 
Unfairness authority is hard to use to enforce privacy harms, since the 
courts have not typically recognized privacy harms as cognizable 
injuries under FTC unfairness standards. Moreover, the FTC lacks the 
authority to issue civil penalties for first-time violations.
    While expanding the Commission's budget is a great step, Congress 
should complement that funding with additional privacy authority so the 
agency can properly fulfill its mission. That's why it is critical that 
Congress passes Federal privacy legislation that builds upon, but does 
not preempt, privacy legislation adopted in states like California and 
Colorado. Already, there has been a concerted effort in Congress and in 
statehouses across the Nation to muddy the conversation and introduce 
privacy bills that appear strong, but merely entrench the status quo of 
privacy violations. Specifically, bills like the one adopted in 
Virginia appear robust, but allow exploitative business practices to 
continue unabated.
    This legislation, drafted by industry and passed with little 
debate, seeks to confuse the conversation and provide cover for deep-
pocketed groups to change the conversation from one about strong 
protections for consumers to one about ``harmonizing'' protections. But 
these bills represent a race to the bottom, and are often deeply 
flawed. For instance, the Virginia bill includes problematic technical 
definitions of personal information, which exclude nearly all of the ad 
tech industry from its scope of opt-out. Under this law, it is not 
clear that the state will allow consumers to opt out of cross-
contextual targeted advertising, the tracking of individuals across 
unaffiliated websites and services. Any law passed by Congress should 
build upon the work done by states that does protect their consumers, 
and not preempt state laws that seek to provide additional protections 
to those enacted by Congress.
    Congress should give the Federal Trade Commission a legal mandate 
to enforce privacy laws beyond those bad actions that are deceptive or 
unfair. This is doubly true since--for certain historical reasons--the 
Commission rarely initiates privacy cases under its unfairness 
authority. The agency's existing authority to regulate privacy, in 
practice, limits it to taking action only after a company has made an 
explicit promise to consumers and then broken that promise. This is 
well short of the robust protections necessary to ensure the privacy 
and security of consumers' data.
    Strong FTC enforcement authority, such as measures proposed by many 
members of this Committee, is essential, as are the provisions granting 
the state attorneys general and private consumers the authority to 
bring suit. Together, they would enable the Commission to undertake a 
robust enforcement regime, and empower consumers and state law 
enforcement to step in when the Commission cannot or will not do so.
Expanding FTC Capacity
The Agency Currently Has Few Privacy Staffers
    Expanding the agency's capacity to enforce the law is also 
critical. Laws alone without enforcement don't protect the public. 
Presently, the Commission's Division of Privacy and Identity Protection 
(DPIP) is tasked with solving the Nation's myriad privacy and 
cybersecurity issues with a bare-bones staff of about 40 attorneys and 
a handful of technologists. In comparison, European countries have 
robust laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 
Each country typically has a Data Protection Agency (DPA) with hundreds 
of staff and dozens, if not hundreds of technologists. For example, the 
German DPA has 745 staff and nearly 100 tech experts enforcing their 
law for a country with one quarter the population of the United 
States.\1\ Similarly, France, which has one-fifth our population, 
employs nearly 200 staff, including 30 tech experts. The nations that 
employ the most technologists have had the most success in bringing 
corrective actions against big technology companies.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The FTC, with its 40 staff and fewer than 10 technologists, simply 
does not have enough resources to police an industry that touches 
nearly every aspect of the American economy. This leads the agency to 
prioritize certain cases, and ignore privacy violations if they aren't 
deemed sufficiently harmful or easy to prosecute, or if the staff hours 
aren't available. If staff are already engaged in one privacy or 
security matter, they may simply ignore harmful acts that arise while 
they are occupied.
    The problem is exacerbated when businesses choose to litigate a 
case rather than accept a settlement. By some accounts, these cases can 
occupy one-third to half of the Commission's entire privacy division on 
a single matter. Again, that's half of the entire Federal privacy staff 
working on one case for years, at the exclusion of other critical work. 
Businesses and their lawyers know and exploit this: in my experience, 
when outside counsel knows that the Commission has its hands full with 
litigation, they recommend that their clients take aggressive stances 
in response to FTC action, knowing that the FTC is unlikely to have the 
resources to adequately challenge them. Companies seek this expert 
knowledge, and hire former FTC officials to advise them on how to best 
avoid regulatory and enforcement scrutiny. Overworked commission staff 
have a hard time making up for this level of deliberate gamesmanship, 
and businesses' strategies to avoid FTC enforcement are quite 
successful.
The FTC Has Limited Enforcement Staff to Monitor Compliance
    The FTC also does not have enough enforcement staff to monitor 
compliance with their orders. The Division of Enforcement--which is 
separate from DPIP, which investigates privacy violations--is tasked 
with overseeing compliance with all of the Commission's consent 
decrees, in addition to the myriad of laws relating to Made In USA and 
textile labeling, for example.\3\ The same lawyers who ensure that 
social media companies have robust privacy and data security programs 
are making sure labels on bed linens are correct. Technology 
enforcement requires its own nuanced set of skills, and the FTC needs 
both numbers and staff with special knowledge. Current enforcement 
staff have varying skill sets, and while they may be generalists, they 
may well not understand algorithms, APIs, or data encryption.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ Federal Trade Commission, What We Do, https://www.ftc.gov/
about-ftc/what-we-do/enforcement-authority.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Commission needs not only enough staff to monitor compliance 
with their orders, it needs that staff to have the expertise to 
understand the complex technological principles the initial violation 
was based on. Presently, the staff who investigate and bring a matter 
are not the ones who handle enforcement of consent decrees for those 
matters. The staff disconnect often results in a huge gap in expertise 
and understanding regarding what underlying privacy violations 
occurred. Ideally, the Commission should have enough staff to leverage 
the expertise of the initial investigators as part of the enforcement 
oversight process.
    In fact, many of the ``Big Tech'' companies with which Congress is 
presently concerned--such as Facebook, Apple, Google, and others--are 
already under consent decree with the Commission. The companies have 
already taken some action that has landed them--essentially--under 
probation with the Commission, and have agreed to a set of negotiated 
terms with the agency. While this appears reasonable on paper, these 
orders don't do much to curb problematic practices: staff limitations 
at the agency mean that enforcement is lax or non-existent. For 
instance, one common enforcement tool is to require companies to submit 
regular third-party assessments of their data practices. These third-
party assessments can provide the Commission insight into ongoing 
compliance by the company. But these assessments are only made 
available to the FTC upon request, and the Commission staff rarely has 
time to request them. In fact, one former FTC enforcement staff has 
publicly stated that the FTC rarely even reads these assessments.\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Under the current arrangements at the FTC, it is quite possible--
even likely--that at least some of the companies under order are 
violating the terms of their agreement but that the Commission doesn't 
have the adequate resources to properly investigate.
The FTC Has Limited Technologists on Staff
    In 2010, I was one of the first two technologists ever hired by the 
Federal Trade Commission to work on privacy matters in DPIP. My 
workload quickly went from handling small portions of matters to being 
deeply involved in nearly every case brought by the Commission. I 
personally helped to bring the Commission's first major successful 
cases against Twitter, Google, and Facebook. I have firsthand 
experience with how important technologists are to the effective 
oversight of big technology companies.\5\

2021), https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-france-fines (explaining 
that the success of the major French antitrust case against Google was 
due to the agency relying on technologists, rather than lawyers, to 
build the case).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Despite this, the Commission only has a limited number of 
technology experts on staff. When I re-joined the agency in 2014, as 
Chief Technology Officer, there was only one other technologist on 
staff. With the support of the then-Chair Ramirez, I helped to create 
the Office of Technology Research and Investigation (OTech) and grew 
that number of technologists to approximately ten by the end of my term 
in 2016. But due to political pressures, these technologists were 
housed not as a separate division that could serve the entire agency, 
but instead in an obscure business unit within the IT staff of the 
Bureau of Consumer Protection (BCP): the same group that maintains 
eDiscovery computers and other litigation support resources for the 
Commission. This awkward structure, which is in place to this day, 
effectively restricts the team by limiting their ability to report to 
key decision makers, and restricts them to functioning alongside the 
same group that provides IT support to investigators, dramatically 
reducing technologists influence across key investigations and 
policymaking.
    Additionally, staff technologists frequently recuse themselves from 
active matters at the Commission due to the FTC's overly broad 
interpretation of rules prohibiting technologists from ever working on 
matters in which they participated during their employment at the 
Commission. Because of the unique nature of technologists' work, this 
same restriction does not apply to the attorneys or economists at the 
Commission, effectively penalizing technologists who work for the FTC. 
This overly broad provision intended to bar technologists from seeking 
post-FTC employment at many private companies on the same matters also 
prohibits them from working alongside the FTC in civil enforcement at 
state agencies, including, as was my experience, for the offices of 
state attorneys general.\6\

Creating a New FTC Bureau
Incentivizing Collaboration and Efficiency at the FTC
    Providing additional resources to the FTC is an essential first 
step to empowering the Commission to pursue strong technology 
enforcement. A new bureau, funded fully, will ensure that the 
Commission can fulfill its mission, and I support the measure. However, 
it is essential that the creation of a new bureau enables the 
Commission to collaborate and leverage its resources to investigate 
fully the wide range of harms caused by new technology and data 
practices.
    To ensure that funding and additional resources are most effective, 
Congress should make clear that collaboration between all of the 
bureaus is an important goal of its funding. Too often, the bureaus at 
the FTC work in isolation, creating silos that fail to maximize the 
expertise throughout the Commission. For example, BCP houses the 
Division of Marketing Practices (which investigates fraud), the 
Division of Advertising Practices (investigating influencers and major 
advertising practices), and the Division of Privacy and Identity 
Protection (investigating privacy and identity theft). These three 
divisions often look into the same entities for related matters, but do 
not often collaborate across the divisions.
    Under this structure, cases that deal with financial practices 
issues in one division could miss the digital harms that pervade the 
business practices at issue. Fortunately, there appears to have been 
cross-division collaboration in a recent Financial Practices case: 
Venmo--likely due to technology staff who are better able to move 
between these boundaries. But in my experience, cross-division 
collaboration is unfortunately not the norm which creates 
inefficiencies and challenges when investigating fast-moving and well 
resourced industry players.
Technology and Data Protection: A New Bureau By Any Other Name
    One way to incentivize collaboration and forward-looking 
enforcement is to appropriately scope any new bureau to reflect the 
underlying needs of the current digital ecosystem. Data security, data 
abuse, and identity theft all have one thing in common: technology and 
the underlying data they rely on. Narrowly constraining a new bureau on 
solely one of those practices, privacy, and giving it a name that 
reflects that narrow focus, would fall short of the consumer protection 
goals laid out for the FTC and by Congress. Instead, the bureau's 
mission and name should reflect the realities of current challenges: 
The Bureau of Technology and Data Protection.
    This may seem like a small point, but names do matter. Many of the 
harms that concern this Committee and are investigated by the 
Commission do not fall neatly into the category of ``privacy'' harms. 
Instead, many are abuses of personal data, harms to civil rights or 
liberties, abuses of kids' data that fall outside of COPPA, and the 
intentional design and release of harmful products.\8\ Data firms often 
innovate new ways to track or identify users without consent, and 
cannot easily be cabined by a singular focus on ``privacy.'' \9\ Other 
harms, such as algorithmic bias or hyper-targeted news feeds and 
recommendation algorithms, also do not fit neatly into ``privacy'' as a 
category. A new bureau should be empowered to investigate these data 
practices: their disproportionate effects on minorities and other 
vulnerable populations, are often what harm consumers the most, and 
often do not fall squarely into ``privacy.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I have long advocated for the creation of a new Bureau of 
Technology and Data Protection, because technology and data pervades 
nearly every case that comes before the Commission. Congress should 
create a bureau with the mission and expertise to investigate harmful 
practices across the technology ecosystem and support the existing 
divisions--like the Division of Privacy and Identity Protection, Ad 
Practices, and Marketing Practices--in order to better protect 
vulnerable populations. This Bureau of Technology and Data Protection 
could issue guidance to staff about how to approach technology in 
matters and could support investigations across the entire range of 
digital harms the commission addresses.
    A Bureau of Technology and Data Protection would provide a ``hub'' 
of resources for the Commission that would serve across the agency's 
many consumer protection missions, incentivize collaboration across 
agency divisions, and encourage efficiency. The Commission could look 
to the Bureau of Economics (BE) as a model. Similarly to BE, the new 
bureau should perform research and investigations to help support the 
Commission's mission. The new bureau can also function as a community 
of practice and expertise within the Commission that informs other 
divisions and the FTC as a whole. When necessary, employees of the new 
bureau, including technologists and other experts, could be detailed to 
other bureaus or groups to support ongoing matters that may benefit 
from their expertise. These meaningful opportunities for collaboration 
and education will create a more robust culture within the FTC, and 
help draw talent.
    The FTC needs more resources, but it also needs the right 
resources. Narrowly focusing the bureau's expertise on ``privacy,'' 
rather than a broader mission of data practices generally, would create 
structural limitations that will live on in the Commission for years to 
come.
Recommendations
    I'd like to briefly lay out a few concrete recommendations for this 
Committee to consider as it moves forward on privacy legislation, 
either in this current legislation or later.
    First, this Committee should focus on the outcomes it seeks to 
enable, rather than becoming entangled in the details of agency 
organization. While additional resources and bureaus are important, it 
is important to implement change in ways that avoid bureaucratic 
siloing or creating divisions between staff at the agency that may well 
be counterproductive to ensuring a strong privacy enforcement regime. 
Instead, the Committee should focus on creating incentives and 
resources for the agency to hire experts and seek collaborative 
solutions to continuing market problems.
    For instance, many of the most pressing harms this Committee is 
concerned with, such as the psychological harms caused to teens by 
social media,\10\ do not fit cleanly into existing privacy enforcement 
tools. The Committee should seek to enable the Commission to seek 
remedies for digital conduct that causes harm, even when the practice 
doesn't fall neatly under deceptive or unfair practices. Additional 
enforcement authorities, such as enabling the Commission to protect 
against negligent design or abusive business practices, would go a long 
way to protecting consumers in the digital age.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This Committee could address these harms by providing guidance to 
the Commission with the funding of this Bureau. For instance, by 
directing the Commission to conduct a rulemaking to reduce the 
instances of identity theft or ransomware attacks online, to increase 
safeguards around extractive data practices (such as microtargeting), 
or to protect populations that are particularly vulnerable online, such 
as communities of color, the LGBTQ+ community, women, and children.
    Similarly, the Committee could greatly reduce the burden on 
consumers by directing the FTC, as Senator Blumenthal already has,\11\ 
to adopt a Global Privacy Control (GPC) as a legally adequate opt-out 
mechanism.

20Rulemaking.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Alongside additional funding and Congressional direction, the 
Committee should take steps to ensure that the Commission hires a wide 
range of staff outside its traditional lawyers, economists, and 
technologists. In addition to those professionals, the agency should 
hire statisticians, designers, social scientists and behavioral 
researchers, such as experts on child development, who can guide 
complex cases that come before them. These experts would allow the FTC 
to review product documents at their earliest stages, understand 
complex project calculations, and identify manipulative designs. 
Additional expertise will also help the agency identify the current 
business practices and apps might contravene existing Section 5 
authority and empower the agency to more fully use its existing 
enforcement tools.
    Further, the Commission should devote more energy to developing and 
retaining its talent outside the traditional Washington, DC pool. It 
should take steps to hire talented individuals from across the country, 
not just Washington. The pandemic showed that remote work is possible, 
and in many circumstances desirable; hiring nationwide, to remote 
positions, and in the regional offices, would better enable the 
Commission to compete for talent with the firms it oversees.
    Once the Commission has talent in the door, it needs to do a better 
job of retaining it. Technologists' pay should be raised to be more 
competitive with technology salaries, which are often many times higher 
than what the Commission offers. Technologists also need to be able to 
complete meaningful and engaging work at the Commission without worry 
that the FTC's obtuse conflicts rules will prevent them from seeking 
future employment later in their careers. Congress should seek answers 
from the FTC about how the Commission will clarify and update its 
conflict rules in order to better attract technologist talent.\12\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
    The creation of a new bureau at the Commission would be an 
important step forward, but it is not the only important change that is 
needed, and the work can't stop there. With a new bureau, the United 
States will gain a stronger Federal Data Protection enforcer, which 
will help allay concerns from Europe, and keep us competitive on a 
global scale.
    The new bureau needs not just money, however, but additional 
substantive authority to investigate and curtail harmful data practices 
and to rely on Commission resources. These necessary tools include 
straightforward legislative fixes, such as providing the Commission 
with first-time civil penalty authority. As the Committee continues to 
pursue this matter, it should strongly prioritize drafting and passing 
a comprehensive data privacy law that empowers Federal regulators, 
including the FTC.
    Congress should consider meaningful protections for consumers, 
including strengthening the Commission, ensuring the attraction and 
retention of talented Federal staff, and ensuring that there are robust 
laws on the books to protect American consumers.

                                Abstract
    The Federal government restricts what former employees can work on 
after they leave the government, and for good reason. These post-
employment conflict restrictions attempt to address the ``revolving 
door'' problem, where employees take information learned from their 
position in government to unfairly advantage industry. But an 
unintended consequence of overbroad conflict rules is that they impede 
well-meaning, former Federal employees from providing their knowledge 
and general expertise to other enforcement agencies with similar 
missions, such as those at the state level. This is playing out right 
now with FTC technologists, at a time when the agency--and, indeed, 
consumer protection agencies more broadly--desperately needs greater 
technical expertise. Three problems result: (1) former FTC 
technologists find themselves unable to contribute to the enforcement 
efforts of other agencies and plaintiffs' attorneys aligned with the 
mission of the FTC, (2) some current FTC technologists are unwilling to 
work on important issues before the agency out of fear that doing so 
will limit their ability to work on related matters in the future, and 
(3) would-be technologists may be unwilling to take a position at the 
agency due to these concerns.
    We explore the impact of Federal conflict rules on technologists 
working with the FTC, consider how this impact has changed alongside 
changing circumstances and enforcement practices, and discuss policy 
implications. We conclude that unless the FTC reforms the way it 
administers its conflict rules, it risks losing the assistance of 
technological expertise--expertise of which it badly needs more, rather 
than less.

VI. CONCLUSION
I. INTRODUCTION
    The Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) laudable decade-long 
experiment to hire in-house technologists may be in jeopardy from an 
unexpectedly bureaucratic source: Federal conflict of interest law. 
Post-employment restrictions for Federal employees are designed to 
ensure that government officials avoid corruption and to slow the 
revolving door into industry. In their current application to former 
technologists, however, they have the counterproductive effect of 
preventing people with technical expertise from engaging in work that 
creates no meaningful conflicts.
    Preventing technologists from accepting unproblematic post-
government work through the conflicts clearance process harms the 
consumer protection and pro-competition missions of the agency. 
Overbroad conflicts clearance policies harm the direct mission of the 
agency by limiting the ability of experts to aid fellow enforcers such 
as state attorneys general, who should be seen as force multipliers or 
fellow travelers in policing technology companies. These policies also 
make it more difficult for the FTC to hire and retain technological 
experts, which hampers the agency's ability to adequately fulfill its 
competition and consumer protection missions. Prospective technologists 
think twice about working for the agency when they hear about the way 
the clearance process has limited the activity of others. FTC employees 
also limit the cases they can work on in order to avoid potential post-
employment conflicts.
    This paper builds on the direct experience of two of the authors, 
one a former Chief Technologist and the other a former Senior Policy 
Advisor for privacy at the FTC. Since leaving the agency, we have 
encountered numerous obstacles in our experience with the FTC's 
clearance process, which we find to be unnecessarily broad in design 
and perhaps also in execution. We have bolstered this firsthand 
experience through interviews with numerous former FTC officials who 
confirm and expand upon our observations.
    We begin with an outline of our methodology. We interviewed eight 
former FTC consumer protection attorneys and technologists and two 
attorneys in the offices of state attorneys general in order to assess 
the extent of the problem. The goal of the interviews was to determine 
whether the experience of two of us being denied the ability to work on 
certain matters post-FTC employment was representative, whether 
technologists and other specialists were treated differently for the 
purpose of conflicts, and whether there was any consensus as to why the 
FTC was applying the conflicts rules the way it was and still is.
    Preserving anonymity to allow our interviewees to discuss sensitive 
topics was and is a key concern, given how few former technologists 
there are and how easily certain details would reveal the identity of 
the interviewees. For the reader's edification, we have tried to 
provide as much context as possible without compromising the anonymity 
of the interviewees, such as by highlighting when statements were 
contradicted by other interviewees, not contradicted by any 
interviewees, supported by interviewees, supported by only some 
interviewees, or when they were supported indirectly. Indeed, the 
difficulty of preserving the anonymity of our interviewees underscores 
the very problem enumerated in this essay--there are simply too few FTC 
technologists for the answers we describe here to allow each subject to 
get lost in a crowd.
    We focus on the FTC because that is the agency with which we have 
direct experience, but the lessons of our analysis may also apply to 
other government agencies seeking to hire and retain technological 
experts, which ought to describe nearly every agency in this 
technological age. The way an agency interprets the conflict of 
interest laws and the way it administers its clearance procedures can 
have an important, underappreciated impact on the way it fulfills its 
mission--and the ability of other enforcers to fulfill theirs.
    Part II of this Article explains why the Federal conflict rules 
were created and how they affected current and former agency employees 
at that time. Part III discusses how changes in technology, economy, 
market, and agency practices have altered the impact of these conflict 
rules on technologists working with the FTC. Part IV explores the 
implications of this changing impact on agency efficacy and on the 
FTC's ability to handle technical and other specialized subject 
matters. Part V offers policy recommendations to address this problem 
to help pave the way for the FTC and other Federal agencies to increase 
their technical capacity, in part by hiring technical specialists.
II. FEDERAL POST-EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS
    Federal law restricts post-government employment opportunities for 
all Federal government employees. The primary source of these 
restrictions across the Federal government comes from one Federal 
ethics statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 207. In addition to Sec. 207, former FTC 
employees must comply with post-employment restrictions set forth in 
the FTC Rules of Practice (i.e., 16 C.F.R. Sec. 4.1(b)). As a starting 
point, it is helpful to understand more about the history, origin, and 
intent of these restrictions, as well as what they do and who 
interprets and enforces them.
A. History and Goals of Federal Post-Employment Restrictions
    Both the Federal conflict statute and the FTC's conflict rules were 
established in the 1960s.\1\ Legislative and administrative history 
show that restrictions on where a former Federal employee may work and 
what matters they may work on are intended to combat the ``revolving 
door'' problem and to prevent both actual government corruption and the 
appearance thereof.\2\ The rules are nevertheless intended to be 
somewhat restrained, balancing the need to combat these problems with 
the need to preserve the government's ability to attract and retain 
top-notch expertise.\3\ Striking the right balance between these 
competing objectives--preventing corruption and facilitating 
expertise--is key to optimizing government function.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ 18 U.S.C. Sec. 207 was established in 1962 alongside several 
other Federal anti-corruption provisions. Act to Strengthen the 
Criminal Laws Relating to Bribery, Graft, and Conflicts of Interest, 
and for Other Purposes, ch. 11, Sec. Sec. 201-09, 218, 76 Stat. 1119-25 
(1962). 116 C.F.R. Sec. 4.1(b) was established in 1967. Commercial 
Practices, 32 Fed. Reg. 8444, 8456-59 (June 13, 1967).
    \2\ See S. REP. NO. 95-170, at 32 (1977) (``18 USC 207, like other 
conflict of interest statutes, seeks to avoid even the appearance of 
public office being used for personal or private gain. In striving for 
public confidence in the integrity of government, it is imperative to 
remember that what appears to be true is often as important as what is 
true. Thus government in its dealings must make every reasonable effort 
to avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest and favoritism.'' 
(emphasis in original)).
    \3\ See id. (``But, as with other desirable policies, it can be 
pressed too far. Conflict of interest standards must be balanced with 
the government's objective in attracting experienced and qualified 
persons to public service. Both are important, and a conflicts policy 
cannot focus on one to the detriment of the other. There can be no 
doubt that overly stringent restrictions have a decidedly adverse 
impact on the government's ability to attract and retain able and 
experienced persons in Federal office.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Federal statute designed to prevent actual and perceived 
conflict by former Federal employees, Sec. 207, was developed on the 
belief ``that a public servant owes undivided loyalty to the 
Government.'' \4\ The statute addresses two primary ways in which 
potential conflicts might occur. First, former Federal employees could 
``switch sides'' upon leaving the government, going on to provide other 
parties with an agency's proprietary information in an adversarial 
proceeding, which would limit the agency's ability to protect the 
public interest.\5\ Second, if Federal employees anticipate using their 
Federal experience to help secure lucrative post-agency employment at a 
regulated entity, they might temper their behavior while employed by 
the agency.\6\ Lax rules for post-agency employment conflicts would 
invite Federal employees to mold their conduct at the agency to make 
themselves more appealing candidates for employment at a regulated 
entity after leaving the agency. The legislative history and subsequent 
cases interpreting the statute and rules also reflect a concern about 
the appearance of conflict, in addition to actual conflicts, because 
even the perception of corruption can erode public faith in the rule of 
law.\7\

fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42728.pdf (``One of the initial and earliest 
purposes of enacting the `revolving door' laws was to protect the 
government against the use of proprietary information by former 
employees who might use that information on behalf of a private party 
in an adversarial type of proceeding or matter against the government, 
to the potential detriment of the public interest.'').
    \6\ Maskell, supra note 5, at 2 (``Another interest of the 
government in revolving door restrictions was to limit the potential 
influence and allure that a lucrative private arrangement, or the 
prospect of such an arrangement, may have on a current Federal official 
when dealing with prospective private clients or future employers while 
still with the government, that is, `that the government employee not 
be influenced in the performance of public duties by the thought of 
later reaping a benefit from a private individual.' '') (quoting Brown

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Federal post-employment restrictions also aim to avoid being overly 
rigid. Overly rigid conflict rules might make it impossible to draw top 
talent to agencies where employees with needed expertise could easily 
find employment with other agencies or the private sector.\8\ Indeed, 
in enacting and revisingSec. 207, Congress was acutely aware that 
restrictive rules could hamstring the government's ability to attract 
and retain technical experts. For example, in a 1960 House hearing on 
Federal conflict of interest legislation, a representative of the 
Department of Defense expressed concern that the proposed Sec. 207 
``would greatly narrow the opportunity for [people who came to 
government from private industry] to seek employment outside the 
Government if they were precluded thereafter from rendering any 
assistance to anyone in connection with any subject matter concerning 
which they had any responsibility.'' \9\ The Defense Department 
representative also pointed out that ``[w]e have had considerable 
difficulty in recruiting engineers and scientists.'' \10\

limitations on former employees' private employment opportunities must,

restrictive provisions on career movement and advancement will have

service.''); S. Rep. No. 95-170, at 32 (1977).

    As Congress deliberated over the structure and wording of conflicts 
restrictions in the year before passage of the bill that established 
Sec. 207, President Kennedy sent a letter to Congress urging 
accommodations for temporary, part-time, and technical experts:

        The fundamental defect of [conflict] statutes as presently 
        written is that: On the one hand, they permit an astonishing 
        range of private interests and activities by public officials 
        which are wholly incompatible with the duties of public office; 
        on the other hand, they create wholly unnecessary obstacles to 
        recruiting qualified people for government service. This latter 
        deficiency is particularly serious in the case of consultants 
        and other temporary employees, and has been repeatedly 
        recognized by Congress in its enactment of special exemption 
        statutes. . .

        But if the statutes often leave important areas unregulated, 
        they also often serve as a bar to securing important personal 
        services for the government through excessive regulation when 
        no ethical problem really exists. Fundamentally, this is 
        because the statutes fail to take into account the role in our 
        government of the part-time or intermittent adviser whose 
        counsel has become essential but who cannot afford to be 
        deprived of private benefits, or reasonably requested to 
        deprive themselves, in the way now required by these laws. 
        Wherever the government seeks the assistance of a highly 
        skilled technician, be he scientist, accountant, lawyer, or 
        economist, such problems are encountered.\11\

    The following decade, after the Watergate scandal, Congress passed 
the Ethics in Government Act, which revised and crafted new post-
employment restrictions as part of a wave of reforms.\12\ Before the 
new restrictions went into effect, however, a number of parties raised 
concerns that the restrictions might interfere with the hiring of high-
caliber employees.\13\ In a report on the legislation, the Subcommittee 
on Oversight and Investigations of the House Committee on Interstate 
and Foreign Commerce explained that ethics restrictions should 
``accommodate the need to attract and retain a qualified and 
experienced work force.'' \14\ The report also stated that ``hearings 
reflected the grave concern of agency heads'' that the ``balance 
between maintaining integrity and ensuring an able workforce has not 
been properly struck.'' \15\ For example, the Secretary of Health, 
Education, and Welfare characterized the revisions as likely to cause 
``the greatest brain drain of talent in the history of Federal 
service.'' \16\ Recognizing the need to strike a balance between 
preventing conflicts and attracting top talent, Congress ultimately 
softened the new limitations before they went into effect.\17\

B. Post-Employment Conflict of Interest Restrictions Under 18 U.S.C. 
        Sec. 207
    The Federal statute defining post-employment conflicts, Sec. 207, 
is both a criminal and a civil statute; those who violate it could end 
up in prison or be subject to a hefty civil penalty.\18\ The statute is 
enforced by the Department of Justice (DOJ),\19\ but the Office of 
Government Ethics (OGE) has regulatory authority to promulgate rules, 
providing further details on the application of Sec. 207 beyond what is 
provided in the statute.\20\ In addition, the FTC provides direct 
guidance to former employees regarding Sec. 207.\21\ Under Sec. 207, 
former Federal employees are not prohibited from taking a job with any 
other potential employer but are prohibited from engaging in certain 
activities.\22\ For former FTC employees, there are two types of 
conduct prohibited under the Federal statute of which they should be 
aware.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \18\ An offense can result in up to a year in prison, and a willful 
offense can result in up to five years. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 216(a) (2018). 
In addition, a person who violates Sec. 207 can be subject to a civil 
penalty up to fifty-thousand dollars for each violation or the amount 
of compensation which they received for the prohibited conduct, 
whichever amount is greater. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 216(b).
    \19\ Post-Employment Conflict of Interest Restrictions, 5 C.F.R. 
Sec. 2641.103(a) (2020).
    \20\ 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2638.108(a)(1).
    \21\ See 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2641.105(a) (stating that ``[t]he agency in 
which an individual formerly served has the primary responsibility to 
provide oral or written advice concerning a former employee's post-
employment activities,'' including regarding Sec. 207). This is 
consistent with our experience. Staff of the FTC's Office of General 
Counsel have provided us with guidance and advice regarding the 
application of Sec. 207 to post-employment activities that we have 
inquired about.
    \22\ 18 U.S.C. Sec. 207; see Office of Gov't Ethics, supra note 17, 
at 11 (``None of its provisions bars any individual, regardless of rank 
or position, from accepting employment with any private or public 
employer after Government service. Section 207 only prohibits former 
employees from engaging in certain activities on behalf of persons or 
entities other than the United States, whether or not done for 
compensation.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    First, the Federal statute essentially prohibits a former Federal 
employee from switching sides on a matter on which they previously 
represented the Federal government.\23\ If a former FTC employee 
communicates to, or appears before, the Federal government as a part of 
their new job with the intent to influence ``in connection with a 
particular matter. . .in which the person participated personally and 
substantially'' as a Federal employee, that behavior constitutes a 
violation.\24\ This prohibition lasts forever.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \23\ 18 U.S.C. Sec. 207; see Maskell, supra note 5, at 2-3; United 
States v. Nasser, 476 F.2d 1111, 1116 (7th Cir. 1973) (holding in favor 
of constitutionality of prohibition language).
    \24\ 18 U.S.C. Sec. 207(a)(1). This only applies when the matter 
also is one ``in which the United States or the District of Columbia is 
a party or has a direct and substantial interest,'' and ``which 
involved a specific party or specific parties at the time'' the former 
employee worked on it. Id. Former Federal employees also cannot engage 
in this variety of prohibited communications and/or appearances before 
the District of Columbia. Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Second, even for a matter in which the former Federal employee did 
not ``participate[] personally and substantially,'' Sec. 207 still 
prohibits the person from working on it if the person ``knows or 
reasonably should know [the matter] was actually pending under his or 
her official responsibility . . . within a period of 1 year before the 
termination'' of their employment.\25\ This restriction expires after 
two years.\26\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \25\ 18 U.S.C. Sec. 207(a)(1)-(2).
    \26\ Id. For a more fulsome explanation of the provisions of 
Sec. 207, including restrictions not discussed here, see Maskell, supra 
note 5, at 3-6.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In determining whether a former matter and a post-employment matter 
are the same, OGE rules state that ``all relevant factors should be 
considered, including the extent to which the matters involve the same 
basic facts, the same or related parties, related issues, the same 
confidential information, and the amount of time elapsed.'' \27\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \27\ 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2641.201(h)(5)(i).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Sec. 207(j) lays out a number of exceptions to these general 
restrictions. For example, under this subsection, former employees are 
exempted from certain post-employment restrictions to carry out 
official duties as a Federal employee, state or local government 
official, or representative of a higher education institution. One 
exception that is particularly relevant to agency technologists is an 
exception under several provisions of Sec. 207 for ``communications 
[made] solely for the purpose of furnishing scientific or technological 
information, if such communications are made under procedures 
acceptable to the department or agency concerned.'' \28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \28\ 18 U.S.C. Sec. 207(j)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As noted above, Sec. 207 is enforced by the DOJ.\29\ Accordingly, 
an agency where a former Federal employee served--such as the FTC--does 
not have the authority to determine definitively how Sec. 207 applies 
to a former employee, but the agency is responsible for providing 
former employees with advice regarding the application of Sec. 207 to 
post-employment activities.\30\ In determining whether and how to 
pursue prosecution under Sec. 207, however, the DOJ may take into 
account a former Federal employee's reliance on advice received from 
the agency where they formerly served.\31\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
C. Post-Employment Conflict of Interest Restrictions Under FTC Rules
    The FTC's rules also restrict what matters a former employee can 
work on after their employment with the FTC ends.\32\ Generally 
speaking, the FTC's post-employment conflict rules prohibit former 
employees from communicating to or appearing before the FTC and from 
assisting or advising behind-the-scenes regarding certain 
``proceeding[s] or investigation[s].'' \33\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \32\ 16 C.F.R. Sec. 4.1(b)(1) (2020).

https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/office-general-counsel/
post-employment-restrictions (last visited Aug. 22, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Most relevant to former technologists is Sec. 4.1(b) of the FTC's 
rules.\34\ After leaving the agency, a former employee generally cannot 
work on a proceeding or investigation that is the same as one in which 
they ``participated'' on behalf of the agency.\35\ A former employee 
also cannot later work on a proceeding or investigation if they 
received or saw ``nonpublic documents or information'' pertaining to it 
while working for the agency.\36\ These restrictions are permanent, but 
the FTC's rules also establish certain time-limited restrictions for 
former employees.\37\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \34\ 16 C.F.R. Sec. 4.1(b).
    \35\ Id.
    \36\ Id.
    \37\ Id. A former employee cannot work on a proceeding or 
investigation that was pending under their official responsibility 
within a year of when they left the agency. Id. This restriction lasts 
for two years after an employee leaves the agency. Id. In addition, for 
one year after leaving the agency, Commissioners and ``senior 
employees'' cannot work on any proceeding or investigation before the 
FTC. Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There is no bright-line rule that enables a former employee to 
conclude with certainty that an activity in which they would like to 
engage constitutes the same ``proceeding or investigation'' as one in 
which they participated while employed by the FTC. According to a note 
in the FTC's rules, ``a new `proceeding or investigation' may be 
considered the same matter as a seemingly separate `proceeding or 
investigation' that was pending during the former employee's tenure.'' 
\38\ In assessing this differentiation, ``the Commission . . . 
consider[s]: the extent to which the matters involve the same or 
related facts, issues, confidential information and parties; the time 
elapsed; and the continuing existence of an important Federal 
interest.'' \39\ These criteria are nearly identical to the criteria 
considered by the OGE in determining whether a former matter and post-
employment matter are the same under Sec. 207.\40\

    \40\ See 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2641.201(h)(5)(i).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The FTC's rules also set forth a formal process to help former 
employees determine whether or not they are indeed restricted from 
working on a matter in their non-FTC employment capacity.\41\ In 
certain circumstances, a former employee is required to file a 
``request for clearance'' to participate in a matter that is or was 
before the FTC.\42\ If the former employee left the agency within the 
previous three years, these circumstances include when the proceeding 
or investigation was pending before the FTC while the former employee 
was there, when the matter is the direct result of another proceeding 
or investigation that was pending before the FTC while the former 
employee was there, or when ``nonpublic documents or information'' 
pertaining to the matter were seen (or likely would have been seen) by 
the former employee as part of their work for the FTC.\43\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \41\ See 16 C.F.R. Sec. 4.1(b)(2).
    \42\ Id.
    \43\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    After a former employee files a clearance request, the FTC's Office 
of the General Counsel (OGC), or designee, has ten business days to 
respond by (1) granting the request, (2) stating that it recommends the 
FTC deny the request, or (3) extending its consideration of the request 
by up to ten additional business days.\44\ If a former employee is not 
sure whether or not they need to file a clearance request, they can ask 
the General Counsel for advice.\45\ The General Counsel or their 
designee will provide advice within three business days.\46\

    \45\ 16 C.F.R. Sec. 4.1(b)(6).
    \46\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Significantly, the FTC's rules grant the agency the discretion to 
simply decline to apply the rules to any specific set of circumstances. 
In addition, the rules do not apply to post-employment activities that 
would be covered if ``otherwise specifically authorized by the 
Commission.'' \47\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \47\ 16 C.F.R. Sec. 4.1(b)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While Sec. 207 is enforced by the DOJ, the FTC's post-employment 
conflict of interest restrictions are applied and enforced only by the 
FTC itself. To help current and former employees better understand the 
rules, the FTC provides guidance on its website.\48\ The agency also 
gives new employees an ethics guide. The guide states: ``if an FTC 
matter was open during your [(i.e., former employee's)] time here, you 
likely need to receive clearance before you work on it for a new 
employer. If you worked on the matter while at the FTC or had access to 
significant non-public FTC information about the matter, you are 
unlikely to get clearance.'' \49\

III. POST-EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS IN FTC PRACTICE TODAY
    As discussed above, post-government employment restrictions seek to 
balance the need to combat the revolving door and corruption with the 
need to preserve the government's ability to attract and retain top-
notch expertise. In the modern era, however, there is a greater need 
than ever in government--and perhaps especially in the FTC--for highly-
skilled, technical expertise.\50\ As a result, these restrictions 
appear to be off-balance with the FTC interpreting and applying post-
government restrictions aggressively to combat the revolving door and 
corruption at the cost of attracting and retaining technical expertise. 
This is particularly true as applied to conduct that supports the FTC's 
objectives and doesn't implicate the corruption concerns that Sec. 207 
was designed to address. A former FTC technologist seeking to consult 
on a state attorney general investigation regarding consumer protection 
matters is better described as entering an adjoining wing than availing 
herself of a revolving door. Section III.A begins by identifying how 
post-employment restrictions arguably are failing to facilitate hiring 
and retention of skilled experts, specifically technologists. Why would 
the FTC administer conflict rules more broadly than necessary to 
advance the policy goals of preventing corruption and slowing the 
revolving door? Sections III.B-F identify several possible 
explanations, including increased market consolidation, the growing 
role of technologists as utility players, the length and breadth of 
consent decrees, the agency's risk-averse culture, and possible 
political conflicts between the FTC and other enforcement agencies.

and oversight challenges created by rapidly changing technology and the 
possibility that the FTC is failing to keep up, see generally Terrell

Intelligence, & Bots: Is the FTC Keeping Pace?, 2 Geo. L. Tech. L. Rev. 
514 (2018).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Impact of Post-Employment Restrictions on Technologists
    The FTC's application of post-employment restrictions today goes 
beyond the policy goal of limiting corruption and the appearance of 
corruption.\51\ The FTC may also apply post-government employment 
restrictions too broadly in cases involving former employees who want 
to work for the companies the FTC investigates, but we focus here 
primarily on circumstances for which there are clear public policy 
reasons to support a more permissive interpretation of post-employment 
restrictions: requests to work for state attorneys general seeking to 
investigate violations of law. In these cases, prohibiting former 
technologists from contributing does not serve the Federal conflicts 
provisions' goal of preventing employees from leaving the government 
and ``switching sides.'' On the contrary, these other entities are best 
characterized as being on the same side as the FTC, and their law 
enforcement work is consonant with the consumer protection and pro-
competition missions of the FTC.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \51\ See Maskell, supra note 5, at 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As technologists and former FTC officials, two of us have 
encountered firsthand the FTC's broad interpretation of post-employment 
restrictions precluding us from contributing to valuable enforcement 
work by other agencies and plaintiffs. In addition, we conducted 
informal interviews of several other former FTC employees and 
technologists in order to ascertain additional information and context 
about how post-employment restrictions affect technologists.\52\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \52\ For a discussion of methodology, see supra Part I.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    From these interviews, we heard consistent variations on a theme: 
there was general consensus that the rules were overly broad, their 
application opaque, and their impact felt acutely and 
disproportionately by former technologists. While not everyone we spoke 
to had sought clearances themselves, many were aware of the process 
from colleagues. Several, however, had firsthand experience contacting 
the FTC to seek advice and, ultimately, clearance regarding matters 
they would like to work on that could be construed as related to 
matters they had worked on while employed by the FTC.
    In particular, former technologists--ourselves included--have often 
been denied clearance by the FTC, under its own rules, to help others 
investigate entities subject to FTC enforcement even after a 
substantial period of time has passed. The crux of the problem is that 
the FTC often considers a state attorney general's current 
investigation regarding a major company to be the same ``proceeding or 
investigation'' as one conducted by the FTC of the same company for 
related practices--even if the FTC's investigation culminated in a 
complaint that has already been settled with the company in 
question.\53\ The FTC further appears to consider technologists to have 
``participated personally and substantially'' in its investigations of 
technology companies.\54\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \53\ 16 C.F.R. Sec. 4.1(b)(1)(i) (restricting post-employment 
activities if ``[t]he former employee participated personally and 
substantially on behalf of the Commission in the same proceeding or 
investigation in which the employee now intends to participate''). As 
discussed below, this problem likely is compounded by the fact that FTC 
consent decrees typically last for twenty years. Infra Section III.D.
    \54\ 16 C.F.R. Sec. 4.1(b)(1)(i). As discussed below, this problem 
likely is compounded by the fact that FTC technologists are relied upon 
as utility players. Infra Section III.C.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In other words, the FTC interprets its conflict rules as 
prohibiting us from working on the ``same side'' as the FTC in 
investigations that run parallel to the agency's mission. On at least 
three occasions, we have sought clearance to provide technical guidance 
to state attorneys general investigating the practices of major 
technology companies. Two of these requests for clearance were denied 
and the third took weeks to process. In fact, on one occasion, FTC 
staff told one of us directly that, even though providing assistance to 
a state attorney general would be working on the ``same side'' as the 
FTC, this was ``irrelevant to the analysis'' under FTC rules.\55\

Office of the General Counsel, Federal Trade Commission, to one of the 
authors (Mar. 01, 2019, 08:00 EST) (on file with authors).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The conflicts rules are intended to prevent the appearance or 
actual existence of conflicts between current employees and companies 
the FTC oversees, not other enforcement entities.\56\ By making it 
unduly difficult for former technologists to receive clearances, the 
agency makes it less attractive for technologists to work there and 
discourages those who do from working on certain cases, thus limiting 
the agency's own efficacy. This problem is intensifying as 
technological advancements increase the FTC's need for technical 
expertise.\57\ In turn, this problem also makes other avenues in the 
U.S. enforcement ecosystem less effective because it limits the access 
of state attorneys general to qualified technology experts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \56\ See MaskelL, supra note 5, at 2 (identifying the animating 
goals of ``revolving door'' laws as ``protect[ing] the government 
against the use of proprietary information by former employees who 
might use that information on behalf of a private party in an 
adversarial type of proceeding or matter against the government, to the 
potential detriment of the public interest,'' ``limit[ing] the 
potential influence and allure that a lucrative private arrangement, or 
the prospect of such an arrangement, may have on a current Federal 
official when dealing with prospective private clients or future 
employers while still with the government,'' and ``prevent[ing] the 
corrupting influence on the governmental processes of both legislating 
and administering the law that may occur, and the appearances of such 
influences, when a Federal official leaves his government post to `cash 
in' on his `inside' knowledge and personal influence with those persons 
remaining in the government.'') (emphasis added).
    \57\ See generally McSweeny, supra note 50.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition to interpreting its own rules in this manner, the FTC 
also appears to interpret Sec. 207 quite broadly. FTC staff have 
advised us that activities we sought to assist alongside state 
attorneys general could implicate Sec. 207 as constituting the same 
matter as one in which we had participated at the FTC.\58\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \58\ 18 U.S.C. Sec. 207(a)(1)(A) (restricting post-employment 
activities related to a particular matter ``in which the United States 
or the District of Columbia is a party or has a direct and substantial 
interest'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The FTC's procedural approach to former employees' conflict 
clearance inquiries raises additional problems. Based on our experience 
and that of the people we interviewed, it seems the FTC's OGC routinely 
denies clearance requests through an informal process completed over e-
mail. The OGC sometimes advises former employees to submit a formal 
clearance request using a form designed for that purpose, but often 
does not. This approach limits the transparency of the decision, 
avenues for appeal, and rigor of the analysis.
B. Increased Market Consolidation
    Increased market concentration and horizontal expansion in the 
technology sector also contribute to the agency's broad application of 
conflicts rules to technologists. In a diversified market, it can be 
easy to tell that a former FTC employee's work investigating Company A 
is not the same ``matter'' as, or is an unrelated ``proceeding or 
investigation'' to, work involving Company B. But when Company A is at 
the heart of both the prior investigation and the prospective work--
perhaps because Company A acquired ``nascent or potential competitor'' 
Company B to eliminate a threat to Company A's market--the potential 
for conflict of interest may be higher.\59\

    There is no question that recent years have seen massive corporate

Open Markets Institute, the three largest social networking sites 
controlled eighty-five percent of the market in 2018, up from seventy-
five percent in 2012; the two largest search engines controlled ninety-
seven percent of the market in 2017, up from eighty-two percent in 
2011; and the two largest e-commerce firms controlled fifty-six percent 
of the market in 2018, up from forty-six percent in 2016.\62\

specific search engines controlling the largest market share have 
changed between 2011 and 2017, the increase in the market share owned 
by the two largest companies at that time nevertheless reflects market 
consolidation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition to greater consolidation in the technology sector, the 
resultant diminished number of targets for enforcers to go after 
overall has provided all enforcement agencies--including the FTC--clear 
reasons to investigate the largest companies for violations of trade 
practice law. Precisely because of their outsized market shares, large 
companies that violate the law have the potential to cause substantial 
injury to large numbers of consumers.\63\ And an enforcement agency 
with limited resources will get the greatest ``bang for its buck'' 
going after companies with large numbers of users, substantial economic 
clout, and a high public profile, rather than going after smaller 
companies. Thus when the FTC announced its record five-billion-dollar 
settlement with Facebook in 2019, the size of the company was relevant: 
as the agency stated in its press release, ``[m]ore than 185 million 
people in the United States and Canada use Facebook on a daily basis.'' 
\64\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \63\ When it violates the law, a company that has a billion users 
has the potential to do greater harm than a company that has only a few 
thousand users.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A review of recent enforcement actions reveals that the enforcement 
efforts of the FTC and state attorneys general are indeed converging on 
a handful of companies. For example, in the last two years alone, 
Facebook has been both a target of the FTC and the subject of public 
investigations by attorneys general in California,\65\ the District of 
Columbia,\66\ Massachusetts,\67\ New York,\68\ and Washington,\69\ as 
well as by a group of at least forty-seven state attorneys general 
investigating Facebook for potential antitrust violations.\70\ 
Similarly, Google settled a complaint with the FTC in August 2019 but 
has been publicly investigated in the past two years by Arizona,\71\ 
Connecticut and New York (in tandem),\72\ and fifty attorneys general 
probing the company's competition practices.\73\

    Because of the increase in the number of investigations targeting 
the same handful of companies, a former employee who wishes to assist 
another enforcer with a new case is increasingly likely to find that 
the new case concerns an old target.
C. Technologists Act as Utility Players
    Unlike most other roles at the FTC, every FTC technologist is 
forced to be a utility player. Although the FTC employs hundreds of 
attorneys and dozens of economists,\74\ it employs fewer than ten 
technologists.\75\ The number of technologists has ebbed and flowed and 
has been as low as only one. Over the past couple decades, however, the 
technical complexity of U.S. commerce has grown, thereby increasing 
agency demand for technical expertise. This has an important impact on 
conflicts. Attorneys and economists can specialize in narrow slices of 
the agency's work and focus on a small docket of investigations, but 
technologists tend to work on a broad set of matters. As a result, for 
purposes of applying the FTC's post-employment restrictions, 
technologists may be more likely than other FTC employees to be 
considered to have ``participated personally and substantially'' in any 
FTC investigation of a major company.\76\

    Technology now pervades nearly every industry the FTC oversees, 
leading some to refer to it as the ``Federal Technology Commission.'' 
\77\ The biggest driver of increasing technical complexity is, of 
course, the growth of computers and the Internet to their modern-day 
prevalence.\78\ Personal computers and the Internet are still 
relatively recent phenomena. In the nineteen years from 1997 to 2016, 
the percentage of U.S. households with desktop or laptop computers more 
than doubled.\79\ From 2000 to 2019, the percentage of U.S. adults who 
used the Internet went from fifty-two percent to ninety percent.\80\ 
The iPhone was not even introduced until 2007,\81\ with the App Store 
following close behind it, and yet today there are almost two million 
apps available for download.\82\ E-commerce has simultaneously 
ballooned over the past two decades.\83\

    As the role of technology in FTC investigations and enforcement has 
expanded, the agency has struggled to adjust accordingly, forcing the 
few available technologists to consult on an outsized portion of agency 
matters.\88\ Our personal experience bears this out. As technologists 
for the FTC, we were asked to consult with attorneys working on 
virtually every case that came before the Division of Privacy and 
Identity Protection, as well as a number of cases originating in other 
divisions. In interviews with other former FTC technologists, we heard 
similar accounts. This means that our potential list of conflicts is 
much longer than non-technologists who work for the FTC for the same 
length of time. Nearly every matter involving technology during our 
tenure crossed our desks, even if many of those interactions were 
fleeting and insubstantial. Still, our list of potential conflicts 
encompasses nearly everything involving complex information technology 
during our employment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \88\ This has been our experience, as well as the experience of 
several people we interviewed. Contact authors for information on 
interviews.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The general dearth of technical experts at the FTC reflects the 
agency's dearth of staff more broadly. Much of the scrutiny the agency 
exacts on technology companies is facilitated by staff working on 
privacy and data security, of which the FTC has only about forty.\89\ 
In contrast, the United Kingdom has more than five hundred people 
working in its Information Commissioner's office,\90\ and Ireland's 
Data Protection Commissioner has over 130 employees.\91\ As far as 
technologists are concerned, while the FTC has between five and nine 
technologists,\92\ Germany--a country with one-fourth the population of 
the United States--has 101 technology specialists working with its data 
protection authorities.\93\ While such a high number is unusual, other 
European countries nevertheless have drastically more technologists 
than the United States; Spain has thirty-six, France has twenty-eight, 
and the United Kingdom has twenty-two.\94\

    The dearth of FTC technologists is also evident in comparison to 
the large population of economists employed by the FTC. The FTC's 
website currently lists approximately 80 staff in the Bureau of

D. Lengthy and Broad Consent Decrees
    Another possible contributor to the FTC's broad application of 
conflicts rules for technologists is the agency's practice of 
establishing broad, twenty-year settlements with parties presumed to be 
in violation of Sec. 5 of the FTC Act.\97\ This would not necessarily 
pose a problem if the FTC understood that the ``proceeding or 
investigation'' in a conflict of interest analysis under Sec. 4.1(b) of 
the agency's rules should be the specific facts that gave rise to the 
twenty-year settlement. But if the rules are instead read broadly--too 
broadly in our view--to encompass ``this company and privacy'' or 
``this company and security,'' the twenty-year term serves as a two-
decades-long restraint on future work for former employees. In 
combination with the fact that companies--especially technology 
companies--are bigger and more horizontally diversified than they were 
in the past,\98\ broad and lengthy consent decrees dramatically limit 
the ability of former FTC staff to work on issues related to technology 
companies for a period that may cover half a person's professional 
career.

    The consent decrees often include provisions that require special 
behavior, oversight, or reporting with respect to a broad range of 
activities. For example, consent decrees negotiated as part of privacy 
and data security cases commonly require parties to commit to not 
misrepresent their privacy or security practices,\105\ obtain express 
consent from consumers with respect to certain data practices,\106\ 
adopt privacy or security programs incorporating certain specific 
practices,\107\ produce regular privacy or security reports that meet 
outlined standards,\108\ and make certain documents available to the 
FTC upon request.\109\

    Because the term of the agreements is long and the scope broad, 
former employees may find that if they worked on or saw documents 
related to an investigation of a company that later settled with the 
FTC, future work relating generally to the data practices of that same 
company is then essentially off-limits for the lengthy term of the 
agreement. Even investigations into products or services that did not 
yet exist at the time can then be construed as the ``same proceeding or 
investigation'' under the agency's rules restricting post-employment 
activities.\110\

E. Risk-Averse Agency Culture
    When we interviewed former FTC employees, they generally agreed 
that another cause of the agency's broad application of post-employment 
conflicts rules is a cultural inclination toward risk-aversion at the 
agency.\111\ In particular, interviewees stated that there is a 
widespread concern about heavy congressional criticism within the 
agency.\112\ This is viewed as a motivating factor for a number of 
agency considerations. Many interviewees stated a belief that the 
agency's extreme caution harkens back to the 1970s when, in what is 
known as ``KidVid,'' the agency attempted to ban television ads for 
junk food directed at children--a move perceived by a congressional 
majority as regulatory overreach.\113\ In response, Congress limited 
the agency's authority and withdrew its funding.\114\ Many believe that 
the agency continues to tread lightly today out of a lingering fear of 
congressional backlash, an assessment echoed by our interviewees. 
Applying this approach to conflicts questions, the agency may 
reasonably calculate that there are few or no downsides to OGC 
rejecting a former employee's clearance request.

(``In more than 40 interviews, former and current F.T.C. officials,

has been too cautious.'').

fallout, and the impact on the FTC's enforcement approach); Confessore 
& Kang, supra note 111 (``The F.T.C. is haunted, for example, by a 
clash with Congress in the 1980s over an attempt by the agency to ban 
television ads for junk food directed at children, known as `KidVid.' . 
. . Fears that Congress could again cripple the F.T.C. have made some 
career lawyers reluctant to take on politically sensitive cases, 
according to current and former employees, speaking about their 
experiences during the Trump and Obama administrations.''). In one 
memorable example of a culture of severe sensitivity to congressional 
censure at the agency, an interviewee described briefing their 
superiors on research that websites were using JavaScript code that 
could surreptitiously dig through a user's browser and access the sites 
they had visited. (Please contact authors for information on 
interviews.) The most heavily trafficked site that was engaging in that 
practice belonged to a pornography website. Id. The interviewee was 
informed that the agency would not investigate the pornography company 
because the FTC did not want to run the risk of being perceived as 
``protecting the privacy of people who watch pornography.'' Id. While 
no other interviewees provided similarly colorful examples to 
illustrate the point, this example is representative of the risk-
adverse culture described by the other former FTC employees.
    \114\ Hoofnagle, supra note 113, at 65 (describing the FTC 
Improvement Act of 1980, which passed in response to the KidVid 
controversy, implemented a Congressional veto of Agency action, limited 
the Agency's rule-making authority, and temporarily expunged funding).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In contrast, granting a former employee's clearance request--
especially when it concerns a major company or highly visible matter--
could provide fodder for a company under the scrutiny of the FTC to 
attempt to drum up criticism of the agency. This is not an unfounded 
concern; in response to unwanted FTC investigation, companies have 
attempted all manner of interference strategies throughout the agency's 
history. For example, in 1918 when the FTC issued a report documenting 
the predatory and collusive practices of meatpackers and calling for 
the nationalization of certain components of the industry, the agency 
was roundly attacked.\115\ The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the New 
York Times Editorial Board called for the agency to be ``cured of its 
present bolshevist and propagandist tendencies,'' \116\ and were echoed 
by Senator James Watson when he specifically targeted the FTC's Chicago 
field office as a ``spawning ground of sovietism.'' \117\ In response, 
the agency investigated, cleared of wrongdoing, but ultimately still 
fired eleven of the employees who worked on the report, and Congress 
removed the agency's oversight of meatpackers, awarding this 
jurisdiction instead to the more industry-friendly Department of 
Agriculture.\118\ Sixty years later in KidVid, when the agency 
considered children's advertising rules, advertisers devoted the 
equivalent of one-fourth of the agency's budget at the time to lobbying 
and public relations efforts against the rules, while advertising trade 
associations petitioned the FTC to compel Chair Michael Perschuk to 
recuse himself based on his prior statements about the regulation of 
children's advertising.\119\ When Perschuk initially refused, the 
advertisers sued, won, and lost on appeal; nevertheless, Perschuk 
eventually recused himself voluntarily to shield the rulemaking from 
further corruption accusations.\120\ These episodes provide support for 
fears of corporate retaliation: when it comes to companies attempting 
to avoid profit-narrowing regulation, some will not hesitate to work 
the referees, and many of those will be rewarded with the calls they 
sought.

    Indeed, we know of at least two instances when the agency acted on 
outside claims of conflict or bias that seemed exceptionally weak on 
their face, and for which it is difficult to explain the agency's 
responses as anything other than extreme risk aversion. One former 
technologist we interviewed publicly criticized a large technology 
company prior to his employment by the agency.\121\ When the company 
filed a complaint with the FTC regarding the employee's participation 
in investigations of the company, the FTC removed the employee from the 
investigation and precluded him from working on any investigation of 
that company for the rest of his employment at the FTC. In another 
case, a large technology company complained to the FTC when a member of 
an FTC technologist's Ph.D. dissertation committee filed a public 
request for the agency to investigate that company. The request was 
based entirely on publicly available information but, because the 
company complained that the employee was somehow conflicted, the FTC 
prohibited the employee from working on any investigations of that 
company. As a result, an important investigation of the company was 
conducted without the support of any FTC technologist for several 
months.

    The agency's attempts to inoculate itself from charges of bias by 
industry are likely to fail because opportunistic companies raise such 
charges even when there is no reasonable basis for them. Nevertheless, 
a deep-seated agency culture of prudence--and a history of successful 
corporate interference--leads the agency to reflexively shy away from 
even the suggestion of possible conflict.
F. Possible Political Conflict Between FTC and State Attorneys General
    It is also possible that perceived political conflict may 
contribute to the overly broad application of post-employment conflict 
restrictions to FTC technologists. To be clear, the FTC often works 
closely with state attorneys general, including in investigations into 
the practices of technology companies.\122\ For example, in 2012, the 
FTC and dozens of state attorneys general coordinated on cases brought 
against Google for its privacy policy practices.\123\ Even though the 
state enforcers pressed arguably more aggressive theories than the FTC 
pursued in its investigation, FTC Commissioner Julie Brill praised the 
settlement extracted by the states.\124\

    Our interviewees downplayed the possibility of rivalry between the 
FTC and the states as playing a significant role in the FTC's 
application of post-employment restrictions. Many of our respondents 
thought it unlikely that perceived political conflict plays a 
meaningful role driving the FTC's broad application of post-employment 
conflict rules. Nevertheless, this is a possibility worth exploring.
    Although the state attorneys general and the FTC frequently are 
well aligned, their respective goals and approaches sometimes diverge. 
A 2013 investigation of Google, regarding the company bypassing privacy 
settings in the Safari browser, led the FTC to enter a settlement with 
Google that required no limits on Google's future behavior.\125\ State 
attorneys general declined the FTC's invitation to join the consent 
decree and continued to press a parallel case that led, arguably, to 
tougher restrictions on Google's conduct.\126\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There are reasons to believe that some amount of competitiveness 
exists between these entities. In many ways, the FTC has become the de 
facto privacy and technology regulator in the United States, even 
though, outside of sectoral laws like the Children's Online Privacy 
Protection Act (COPPA) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), there 
is currently no comprehensive Federal privacy law.\127\ The FTC 
benefits from the appearance that it is the primary and most powerful 
enforcer of fair trade practices in the United States because, when a 
regulator has a reputation as being toothless, companies subject to 
their jurisdiction have no incentive to comply with the relevant rules. 
As a result, the FTC sometimes competes with state attorneys general 
when enforcing high-profile cases. When state enforcement agencies 
investigate and impose stronger perceived penalties on companies that 
the FTC has already investigated, charged, and settled, this could 
undermine the FTC's status as supreme enforcer.\128\

note 122, at 756 n.42 (``In important areas, [state attorneys general 
(AG)] have set privacy policy in the absence of Federal norms; in 
others, they have pressed the FTC to offer greater privacy protections 
to consumers than those afforded by Federal agencies. In the near 
future, there may be more aggressive state AG privacy and data security 
enforcement than enforcement activity at the Federal level.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The experiences of one interviewee who worked on consumer 
protection investigations with a state attorney general's office speak 
to the occasional tensions between the FTC and state attorneys general. 
The interviewee hypothesized that in certain, high-profile cases, the 
FTC's willingness to allow the former employee to consult on the state 
attorney general's case was hindered by the agency's interest in public 
credit for tackling certain cases. The interviewee hypothesized that 
the agency's desire for public credit was responsible for the friction 
in that particular case because the interviewee had not encountered 
similar problems when working with FTC officials on previous lower-
level cases. The interviewee explained that in response to a request 
for clearance to work with state AGs on a high-profile matter, the FTC 
denied clearance for the interviewee unless the interviewee was willing 
to work as an unpaid FTC employee and allow the FTC to mediate their 
recommendations to the state agencies.\129\ Indeed, there is good 
reason for FTC staff to seek public credit for its enforcement efforts. 
In recent years, the FTC has been lambasted by a range of critics for 
its failure to take strong, decisive action to rein in unfair and 
deceptive trade practices.\130\ Even the agency's record-breaking five-
billion-dollar settlement with Facebook drew widespread criticism that 
it was simply not enough.\131\

further constrain the agency's authority. Indeed, a number of privacy 
advocates have called for Congress to create a new data protection 
authority to counteract the FTC's failures and hold technology 
companies accountable.\132\ Senator Gillibrand,\133\ Senator 
Brown,\134\ and Representatives Lofgren and Eshoo \135\ heeded that 
call by offering legislation that would establish a new data protection 
agency in the United States.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The FTC could be concerned that if state attorneys general were to 
frequently pursue additional enforcement action against companies for 
practices that have already been the subject of FTC settlements, 
companies would have less of an incentive to agree to truly burdensome 
conditions when they are brought to the settlement negotiation table 
over alleged violations. It is not unusual for the FTC to release any 
claims it may have against the subjects of its enforcement actions as 
part of the negotiated settlement.\136\ If a company caught violating 
the FTC Act believed it was likely to just be sued again for the same 
behavior by another enforcer, then the FTC's avowal to release any 
claims related to the violation would have little value.

IV. IMPLICATIONS FOR AGENCY EFFICACY
    As this Article has noted throughout, the broad application of the 
conflict rules undermines their purpose and the FTC's ability to 
fulfill its competition and consumer protection mission. The FTC is 
making it less attractive for technologists to work at the agency by 
disproportionately limiting the work they are able to do, including 
when the matters former employees are being precluded from 
participating in create neither an actual conflict nor the appearance 
of it. Unwieldy and unpredictable post-employment constraints will make 
it even less attractive, or frankly feasible, for technologists to work 
for the FTC than it already is, raising exactly the concerns that 
Congress has repeatedly noted when revising Sec. 207.\137\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \137\ Supra notes 13, 17.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This overbroad application of the FTC's rules also undermines the 
agency's broader mission of consumer protection by inhibiting other 
consumer protection actors, such as state attorneys general, from 
gaining the expertise to adequately seek remedies in areas the FTC 
itself was unable to obtain. For example, many organizations criticized 
the five-billion-dollar settlement with Facebook because the settlement 
includes very little in the way of injunctions to restrict the 
company's future practices with regards to privacy harm of third-party 
companies, like Cambridge Analytica.\138\ In fact, the final settlement 
also precludes Facebook, its executives, and its board of directors 
from being held responsible for ``any and all claims'' prior to the 
settlement date.\139\ Two FTC Commissioners criticized this point, and 
one implied the existence of other ongoing investigations into the 
company that were released as a part of the settlement.\140\ In 
addition, private plaintiffs already face steep hurdles to getting 
their privacy violations redressed due to years of judicial hostility 
toward privacy rights.\141\ Making it harder for private plaintiffs to 
find and retain technology experts will make the already minimal 
utility of courts to vindicate privacy rights less meaningful still.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Overbroad application even limits the efficacy of the few 
technologists the agency does employ. In the interviews we conducted, 
we heard from former employees who had recused themselves from working 
on certain cases for fear of being broadly precluded from ever working 
on a related matter once they left the agency, one citing market 
consolidation as the justification. As such, concerns of post-
employment conflict checks are likely chilling the freedom that current 
FTC employees have to work on certain investigations while at the 
agency. This corrodes the agency's effectiveness given how few 
technologists it employs already. With the agency's current volume of 
technologists, if even one technologist declines to work on cases 
involving Facebook or Google, for example, the agency loses a 
significant fraction of its available technological expertise--
expertise that it cannot afford to lose.
    The FTC is taking the population of employees that it has the 
hardest time recruiting and making it disproportionately even less 
attractive for them to work there. Technologists are subject to 
potential conflicts far more broadly than employees in other 
disciplines, even though technologists are much harder for the agency 
to locate and retain than attorneys and economists.\142\ An entry-level 
engineer's compensation at Facebook with no post-collegiate work 
experience can reach $166,000 and up to $189,000 at Google in 2019, 
while senior staff roles at the FTC can only make up to around 
$170,000.\143\ This difference in potential salary in conjunction with 
the broad and opaque application of the conflict rules render it even 
less appealing for technologists to work at the FTC. Not only are the 
conflicts rules making it harder for the agency to recruit and retain 
the population of employees it needs most,\144\ they seem fairly 
ineffective at reducing the revolving door problems for non-
technologist employees and senior leadership.\145\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \142\ Different factors, such as advance planning and unchanging 
subject matter, influence why non-technologists are easier for the 
agency to find and retain. For example, the Bureau of Economics at the 
FTC was proactive in its creation rather than reactive; that is, it was 
created all at once with many staff with the objective of changing the 
agency's focus, as opposed to bit by bit in reaction to subject matter 
changing beyond the agency's control.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In almost cruel irony, the lack of competition among the technology 
companies subject to the FTC's jurisdiction further hampers its ability 
to enforce antitrust laws. The technology companies that the FTC 
investigates, like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google, are frequently 
repeat players.\146\ The size of these companies and the range of 
markets they have inserted themselves into makes overlap inevitable. 
When the FTC prohibits an employee from working on matters related to 
one technology company, that often means that the employee will be 
forbidden from working on a whole host of investigations across a wide 
gamut of sectors.\147\ The lack of competition in the technology sector 
means that the agency's broad enforcement of the conflicts rules will 
significantly undercut its efforts to fulfil its consumer protection 
and competition missions.

    \147\ Between the enormous range of sectors Amazon is involved in 
through its provision of cloud services and the range of sectors that 
sell products through its site, and the fact that online advertising is 
overwhelmingly dominated by Facebook and Google, all kinds of 
competition and consumer protection investigations will necessarily 
involve these companies. See, e.g., Khan, supra note 61, at 768-78 
(describing how Amazon leverages its delivery infrastructure into 
outpricing competitors in a range of industries, such as when it 
eliminated its biggest competitor in diapers and other baby care goods 
through a carefully orchestrated predatory pricing scheme and ultimate 
acquisition). Amazon accounted for over a third of online retail sales 
in the United States last year. Jessica Young, US Ecommerce Sales Grow 
14.9 percent in 2019, Digital Com. 360 (Feb. 19, 2020), https://
www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/us-ecommerce-sales/. The FTC is also 
currently undergoing a review of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Alphabet, and 
Microsoft's reliance on ``killer acquisitions''--i.e., the practice of 
buying a nascent competitor to neutralize the threat posed by the 
smaller company's product. Kang & McCabe, supra note 146.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Meanwhile, the collateral effects of the FTC's overreaction hamper 
its ability to oversee those companies effectively. The agency simply 
does not employ enough technologists to be able to sideline them every 
time a subject or potential subject of investigation files a bad-faith 
complaint. As of 2019, the FTC only employed five full-time 
technologists in total, for an agency that oversees digital consumer 
protection issues for a nation of 330 million people and handles a 
range of other issues beyond privacy, security, and digital 
competition.\148\ The FTC's lack of sufficient technologists on staff 
has been a frequent point of criticism by advocates,\149\ former\150\ 
and current\151\ FTC officials, and Congress,\152\ and the agency has 
acknowledged the deleterious effects of the lack of technologists on 
its effectiveness.\153\ The overly broad application of the conflict 
rules exacerbates this problem.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
V. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
    We offer policy recommendations to address this problem and help 
pave the way for the FTC and other Federal agencies to increase their 
technical capacity. The FTC has joined Congress and civil society in 
bemoaning its lack of technical experts, and it must mitigate the 
obstacles that currently make correcting this problem so difficult. We 
offer specific suggestions and broader objectives that will help 
mitigate the current obstacles the agency faces in order to attract and 
retain technology expertise.
    To be clear, we do not mean to diminish the need for conflict of 
interest laws, nor do we support watering down the efficacy of those 
laws to prevent corruption or slow the revolving door. We see civil 
service as an important, if not sacred, calling, and we endorse the 
strong use of conflicts rules to discourage cynical or opportunistic 
people from trading on government service for personal gain. In fact, 
we think in some cases conflict of interest laws may need to be 
strengthened as there are still a great deal of former employees that 
``switch sides'' and join companies the agency is tasked to 
oversee.\154\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \154\ Janofsky & Drange, supra note 143.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    However, we believe that the FTC-administered rules go far beyond 
these important goals, especially when applied to technologists.\155\ 
As discussed above, in many cases, former FTC technologists seek simply 
to work on the same side as the agency in the furtherance of consumer 
protection.\156\ In those situations, we think a reevaluation of 
priorities is warranted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \155\ See discussion in supra Section III.A.
    \156\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    First, the FTC should address the current vagueness in determining 
when different projects comprise either the same ``proceeding or 
investigation'' under 16 C.F.R. Sec. 4.1(b) or the same ``particular 
matter'' under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 207(a). Under the current formulation of 
the rule, in making this determination the FTC considers ``the extent 
to which the matters involve the same or related facts, issues, 
confidential information and parties; the time elapsed; and the 
continuing existence of an important Federal interest.'' \157\ The FTC 
could interpret this broad set of factors as permitting it the latitude 
to determine that ``same side'' investigations that take place after an 
FTC settlement complaint has already been brought constitute new and 
separate ``proceeding[s] or investigation[s].'' At present, however, 
the FTC interprets the vagueness of this multi-factor test to apply 
post-employment restrictions extremely broadly, in a way that we 
believe ultimately runs counter to the public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \157\ 16 C.F.R. Sec. 4.1(b)(1) n.1. In setting forth these factors, 
the FTC refers to an analogous section of the Office of Government 
Ethic's regulations setting forth the factors considered to determine 
whether two particular matters are the same under Sec. 207: ``the 
extent to which the matters involve the same basic facts, related 
issues, the same or related parties, time elapsed, the same 
confidential information, and the continuing existence of an important 
Federal interest.'' 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2641.201(h)(5)(i).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Second, the FTC should clarify that whether or not one particular 
``proceeding or investigation'' is the same turns more narrowly on the 
specific facts of the underlying investigation. The 2012 consent decree 
with Facebook speaks to this.\158\ The consent decree stemmed from an 
investigation into, among other things, changes to Facebook's privacy 
policies that made more information about its users visible to the 
public than before and misled consumers about the amount of information 
third-party apps could obtain about users.\159\ The investigation led 
to a settlement and twenty-year consent decree that obligated Facebook 
to create a ``comprehensive privacy program'' and to report to the FTC 
for twenty years.\160\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    For former FTC officials who worked on the 2012 consent decree, 
what is the underlying matter that might trigger conflicts review 
today? We contend that the matter should be closely related to the 
facts that existed in 2012, which was largely premised on changes to 
privacy policies in 2009 and 2010 as well as aspects of Facebook's 
architecture in 2011. In contrast, the FTC seems to take a much broader 
interpretation, treating the underlying ``matter'' as ``Facebook and 
privacy.'' For example, the FTC has prevented at least one of us from 
working on cases related to Cambridge Analytica, the company that 
notoriously mined Facebook user data in the 2016 election, by claiming 
they were too closely related to the 2012 consent decree matter, even 
though Cambridge Analytica did not even exist in 2011.\161\ The FTC 
allowed another of us to participate in a matter related to Cambridge 
Analytica but only after a two-week delay that prevented a more 
meaningful role in the case. A definition of ``proceeding or 
investigation'' as expansive as ``Facebook and privacy'' or ``Amazon 
and predatory pricing'' will disqualify the FTC's technologists from 
working on crucial investigations, even as these companies consistently 
repeat the same kind of exploitative practices and necessary 
technological expertise becomes harder and harder for enforcers to 
find, attract, and retain.

    \161\ Cambridge Analytica was founded in 2013. See David Ingram,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Third, to bring even more clarity to its conflicts analysis, the 
FTC should consider announcing a bright-line rule in the form of a time 
limit on conduct that will be considered the same ``matter'' or 
``proceeding or investigation.'' For example, the FTC might decide 
that, for investigations into the conduct of platforms, such as social 
networking services or search engines, it is not the same ``matter'' if 
it occurs more than two years after an earlier matter, nor is an 
investigation the same ``proceeding or investigation'' if it arises 
more than two years later. This approach finds support in the rhetoric 
of the FTC itself, which regularly publishes paeans to the speed and 
dynamism of innovation in the technology industry.\162\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To blunt the potential arbitrariness of a rigid two-year deadline, 
this gloss on the FTC rules can be presented as a rebuttable 
presumption: facts will be presumed not to involve the same matter 
after two years, but the FTC can rebut the presumption by marshaling 
specific facts demonstrating the same matter.
    Fourth, the FTC should also revise its rules to make it easier for 
former technologists to consult on ``same side'' investigations, such 
as those conducted by state attorneys general. To do this, the FTC 
should revise its definition of ``communicate to or appear before''--a 
key definition that serves to specify which types of activities by 
former employees are subject to restriction.\163\ Under the current 
definition, the FTC's rules are triggered when a former employee 
engages in ``any oral communication or written communication to, or any 
formal or informal appearance before, the Commission or any of its 
members or employees on behalf of any person (except the United States) 
with the intent to influence.'' \164\ We recommend that the agency add 
``or the Government of one of the States'' to the parenthetical 
exception. The purpose of the rules is to enable more effective 
enforcement of the law by preventing agency capture or the appearance 
of corruption, and the exception acknowledges that other work on behalf 
of the government does not present that concern. The exception easily 
could--and should--be extended to work on behalf of state attorneys 
general, which support the agency's consumer protection and competition 
mission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \163\ See 16 C.F.R. Sec. 4.1(b)(1) (restricting when a ``former 
member or employee . . . of the Commission may communicate to or appear 
before the Commission, as attorney or counsel, or otherwise assist or 
advise behind-the-scenes, regarding a formal or informal proceeding or 
investigation'').
    \164\ 16 C.F.R. Sec. 4.1(b)(5)(ii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The FTC's rules must be revised, but in the meantime, the OGC can 
also simply exercise its discretion to grant more clearance requests 
from former technologists seeking to work on investigations on behalf 
of state attorneys general. In laying out prohibited conduct for former 
employees, the text of the rules clarifies that post-employment conduct 
may be ``otherwise specifically authorized by the Commission,'' though 
the rules do not elaborate further about what those circumstances might 
be.\165\ In addition, Sec. 207 includes a specific exception for former 
employees that provide scientific or technological information. That 
exception states in part that certain Sec. 207 restrictions do not 
apply ``with respect to the making of communications solely for the 
purpose of furnishing scientific or technological information, if such 
communications are made under procedures acceptable to the department 
or agency concerned.'' \166\ In many instances, state attorneys general 
seek former technologists' advice on policy and strategy, not solely 
for scientific or technological information. However, there are 
circumstances in which the FTC could rely on this exception to quickly 
bless requests from former technologists to provide scientific or 
technological information to other parties, particularly those on the 
``same side.'' Yet FTC staff never even mentioned the existence of this 
exception to those of us who are former technologists when we sought 
advice on possible conflicts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \165\ 16 C.F.R. Sec. 4.1(b)(1).
    \166\ 18 U.S.C. Sec. 207(j)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition, the FTC should create greater transparency into its 
substantive evaluation of clearance requests, as well as into the 
procedures it applies in considering those requests. At present, it is 
difficult for members of the public and, indeed, former technologists 
themselves to gain insight into this process. Under the FTC's rules, 
``[a]ny request for clearance filed by a former member or employee 
pursuant to this section, as well as any written response, are part of 
the public records of the Commission, except for information exempt 
from disclosure under Sec. 4.10(a) of [the] chapter.'' \167\ However, 
documents related to clearance requests are not available on the FTC's 
website or in its ``FOIA Reading Room.'' We submitted a request to the 
FTC under the Freedom of Information Act for ``[a]ll documents relating 
to clearance requests filed by former FTC employees under 16 C.F.R. 
Sec. 4.1(b)(2)'' from January 2017 to March 2020, but our request was 
denied on the basis that ``the resources required to process your 
request would cause an unreasonably burdensome review process for the 
agency.'' \168\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \167\ 16 C.F.R. Sec. 4.1(c).
    \168\ Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and response on 
file with authors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The agency's clearance process should also be clarified so that ex-
employees know what to expect. The FTC's rules set forth particular 
procedures for FTC consideration of clearance requests filed by former 
employees. But in our experience, the staff of OGC frequently dismiss 
clearance requests informally over e-mail, without either directing 
former employees to file formal requests pursuant to the FTC's rules or 
referring the matter to the Commission for approval.\169\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \169\ See 16 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 4.1(b)(6)-(7).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We also propose that OGE revise its regulations under Sec. 207. In 
particular, OGE should vest Federal agencies, including the FTC, with 
clearer authority to determine when a particular ``matter'' is the same 
as another for purposes of applying Sec. 207. At least where 
independent agencies are concerned, we propose that this interpretative 
authority lie with the specific agency where a former Federal employee 
previously served. This would constitute a modest shift from OGE's 
current guidance that the agency where an employee previously served 
may advise the employee as to the application of Sec. 207 but that any 
advice it provides will not be binding on the DOJ.\170\ Granting 
clearer deference to Federal agencies--including the FTC--on the 
question of whether or not two particular matters are the same may 
empower the FTC to make the determination based on whether or not it 
believes there is a true conflict of interest, rather than based on the 
agency's over-prudent estimation of the broadest way in which the DOJ 
could possibly construe the question itself.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \170\ 5 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 2641.105(a), (c). This would also be 
consistent with at least one Federal appellate case that considered a 
``same particular matter'' question in an instance where the agency in 
question had advised the former employee that two matters were not the 
same. CACI., Inc.-Federal v. United States, 719 F.2d 1567, 1576 (Fed. 
Cir. 1983) (``This ruling is entitled to weight. It would be most 
unusual to disqualify [former employee] Sterling from bidding on the 
proposal because of Stevens' participation for Sterling after the 
Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division had 
advised Sterling that Stevens' handling of the proposal for Sterling 
would not be improper.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Finally, parallel reforms would also help alleviate the problems we 
have outlined, or at least they would help ensure that even if former 
technologists continue to be broadly precluded from contributing to 
similar work with other agencies, this disincentive does not completely 
halt the influx of technologists interested in public service. For 
example, a modest raise to the pay scale for government employees would 
help attract technologists. It is a tall order to expect recently 
graduated computer scientists to turn down six-figure salaries working 
for technology companies in the background of financial burdens like 
substantial student debt or supporting families.\171\ Students with 
fewer resources are disproportionately deterred from government 
service, which results in a Federal service that is disproportionately 
wealthier than the rest of the population. Public service should not be 
a vocation reserved for the independently wealthy. The practices of 
technology companies implicate every part of society, and we need 
enforcers with diverse backgrounds and prior experiences. Moreover, 
paying public servants at rates more comparable with the private sector 
would help to reduce the revolving door problem. Agency employees, 
congressional aides, and public servants at all levels of government 
would not need to leave the government out of financial necessity if 
government service paid comparable rates to the private sector. Public 
service may be a calling, but a calling cannot feed children or pay a 
landlord.

who Moved Over to Tech. Is Reform Needed?, Protocol (Mar. 9, 2020), 
https://www.protocol.com/ ftc-tech-hawley-revolving-door/ (quoting one 
former FTC employee who now works for Electronic Arts as saying that it 
can be ``very difficult to live there on a government salary,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
VI. CONCLUSION
    Few question the dire need for technological expertise at the U.S. 
consumer protection and competition agency. Yet, the FTC is 
exacerbating its existing difficulty in recruiting and retaining 
technologists by unduly limiting the kind of work technologists can 
undertake after leaving government service. The FTC's interpretation 
and uneven application of well-intentioned conflict rules further 
undermine not only its own efficacy, but also the efficacy of 
complementary enforcement bodies that support the agency's mission. We 
urge a series of modest reforms to prevent post-employment restrictions 
from hamstringing the FTC's enforcement efforts as well as those of 
other agencies. We hope these reforms will also help pave the way for 
skilled technologists to seek and secure meaningful careers in public 
service without unnecessarily hemming in their future career prospects.

    The Chairwoman. Thank you. Thank you very much. We will now 
hear from Mr. Morgan Reed from The App Association who is here 
in person. Thank you.

             STATEMENT OF MORGAN REED, PRESIDENT, 
                   ACT | THE APP ASSOCIATION

    Mr. Reed. Chairman Cantwell, Ranking Member Wicker, my name 
is Morgan Reed and I am the President of ACT | The App 
Association. We are a leading trade group representing small 
software and device companies in the app economy, a $1.7 
trillion global sector that supports roughly 5.9 million jobs 
here in the U.S.
    I am here to share the perspectives of App Association 
members, many of which are in your states, on the need for 
strong Federal privacy laws and enforcement. And when I say in 
your state, I am not doing some kind of hand waving blanket 
gesture, I am talking about real companies. Chair Cantwell, in 
Spokane we have Mighty Call, which provides a cloud based 
communications platform for small businesses to connect teams 
remotely. In Starkville, we have got Buzzbassador. They provide 
a management platform for brands to use Ambassadors promoting a 
product across social media.
    And in my written testimony, there are examples for every 
single one of your states and in every single one of the 
districts in this country. We changed the way we are doing 
business today, whether it is farming, education, 
communication, and sometimes just having fun. These companies 
rely on consumer trust much more than large companies with 
brand recognition and privacy is the leading factor.
    According to Pew, 63 percent of consumers say they have 
deleted an app due to privacy concerns, and 65 percent cite 
trust in brand as their number one consideration when deciding 
whether to allow access to their information. My member 
companies are small and can't buy a Super Bowl ad to create 
brand awareness. So when we try to reach customers through the 
app stores, we rely heavily on the trustworthiness of the 
ecosystem and the marketplaces within. The Federal Trade 
Commission and this committee play an important role in 
maintaining that trust by maximizing consumer protection while 
fostering growth in the economy.
    To better protect consumer privacy, we urge you to take 
these four considerations into account. Number one, Congress 
should set the scope and purposes of the FTC enforcement 
authority and resources on privacy. The existing regulatory 
framework for the FTC does not have the tools to deal with the 
more complex data and privacy questions that arise. The rest of 
the world has surged ahead of the U.S. on these questions. When 
Europe instituted the GDPR, it was clear the U.S. would have to 
act, if just to harmonize.
    But now 16 other countries have national privacy laws 
matching GDPR, and as Chair--as Ranking Member Wicker noted, 
there are 100 more countries with some form of national privacy 
law, and the U.S. still has nothing. The FTC needs better 
privacy tools based on the risks data processing activities 
posed to consumers and the expectations that people have about 
its use. It is up to Congress to set forth the overarching 
purposes and specify the limits on FTC rules.
    Failure to act hurts American citizens and American 
competitiveness globally. Number two, if Congress doesn't act, 
we have seen what--how FTC is forced to stretch their 
authority. The FTC's recent effort to use breach notification 
to cover unauthorized sharing is an example how the FTC has to 
cobble together a solution in the absence of Congressional 
action. Just like Tom Hanks character in the movie Cast Away 
using ice skates to open coconuts, the Commission is settling 
for the tools it can find rather than the right tool when it 
proposes to enforce a breach notification rule as a privacy 
law. But we are not on a desert island.
    Congress can and should make the right tools for the job. 
Number three, Congress should produce more--should produce one 
national privacy framework. The single most important policy 
decision Congress can make to combat existing and future 
privacy harms is to enact comprehensive privacy legislation 
that grants strong consumer rights to the citizens of all 50 
states simultaneously. A patchwork will make it hard for small 
businesses like mine and comparatively easy for big companies 
with hundred lawyer compliance departments. In short, 
preemption is essential to the success for the little company. 
And number four, Congress should avoid antitrust measures that 
prohibit some of the most important platform level privacy 
controls consumers and app makers rely on today. Big companies 
doing business on the app stores, Epic games and Spotify and 
others, have their own big brand, and some of them don't want 
the app stores to manage the platform.
    However, we urge you not to undermine trust in the app 
economy with bills that would prevent key privacy protections 
my members rely on to bring consumers to market. To be clear, 
we are not opposed to and in fact support the FTC vigorously 
enforcing the law on privacy and on unfair methods of 
competition. For example, on the competition side, the 
Commission has the opportunity to clarify the applicability of 
its UMC authority to standards essential patents.
    Anti-competitive self-abuse harms consumers and small 
businesses and competition alike, and this is an example of 
where the FTC guidance can help. But ultimately, the economic, 
health, education and frankly, opportunities for growing new 
businesses created for--in our country, depend on a robust and 
appropriately funded FTC.
    Congress needs to get this right and they need to do it 
now. And without it, we are left with giving the FTC a pile of 
money and they are going to end up spending it on additional 
ice skates to open coconuts rather than the tools that they 
need to solve the problems that we face today. Thank you.

Executive Summary
    ACT | The App Association (the App Association) is the leading 
trade group representing small mobile software and connected device 
companies in the app economy, a $1.7 trillion ecosystem employing 
186,590 people in Washington and 14,190 in Mississippi.\1\ Our member 
companies create the software that brings your smart devices to life. 
They also make the connected devices that are revolutionizing 
healthcare, education, public safety, and virtually all industry

and compete with each other and larger firms in a variety of ways, 
including on privacy and security protections.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    One of the foundational imperatives for the success of small 
business innovators in the app economy is consumer trust in the 
marketplace. The vast majority of mobile device users cite trust as the 
number one factor when deciding to grant an app access to their 
personal data, and users already commonly restrict access and delete 
apps they believe pose a privacy risk.\2\ Eighty-nine percent of users 
have at some point denied features, such as microphone or location 
access, to an app they did not trust, while 63 percent of users have 
deleted an app outright due to privacy concerns.\3\ Because our member 
companies are small and often young companies, they rely more heavily 
on the privacy and security protections and controls that protect 
consumers from bad actors than their larger, more established 
counterparts--which depend more on brand name reputation and 
recognition. Therefore, the Committee's and the Federal Trade 
Commission's (FTC's) role in holding bad actors accountable is critical 
to the success of App Association members. Specifically, we urge you to 
take the following recommendations into account as you evaluate next 
steps on consumer privacy:

  1.  Congress Should Guide FTC Enforcement Authority and Resources. 
        Though the FTC is the main privacy enforcer at the Federal 
        level and has its hands full in recent years with the 
        proliferation of privacy, security, and other consumer 
        protection issues, it often lacks the statutory authority and/
        or dedicated funding to carry out its mission to the fullest 
        potential.
  2.  Congress Should Avoid Forcing the FTC to Stretch its Own 
        Authority. The FTC's recent steps to bolster its leadership in 
        the privacy space, while certainly understandable, demonstrate 
        that the Commission is working with limited tools at its 
        disposal.
  3.  Congress Should Enact a Federal Privacy Framework. The single 
        most impactful policy decision Congress can make to combat 
        existing and future privacy harms is to enact comprehensive 
        privacy legislation that grants strong consumer rights to the 
        citizens of all 50 states simultaneously.
  4.  Congress Should Avoid Antitrust Measures that Presume the 
        Illegality of Platform-Level Privacy Protections. These 
        proposals could unintentionally render widely-adopted privacy 
        protections illegal, especially those that consumers use on 
        their smart devices, exposing consumer data to greater privacy 
        and security risks.

    We deeply appreciate your leadership as the Senate Commerce 
Committee continues to navigate the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and 
works to get our economy back on track. As part of these efforts, we 
ask that you continue the bipartisan work of crafting a single set of 
rules governing the privacy practices of entities that generally fall 
under the FTC's jurisdiction. Recent events and the forced shift of 
daily and essential activities--including core healthcare and 
communication services--to the digital space has underscored the need 
for Congress to act decisively on this issue.
I. Congress Should Guide FTC Enforcement Authority and Resources
    We support enhancing the enforcement capabilities and resources for 
the FTC to stop and prevent consumer protection harms by bad actors. 
The FTC needs more appropriate tools with Congress' direction to stop 
consumer harms resulting from privacy and data security abuses in 
particular, as those problems have proliferated and continue to 
generate headlines and stoke constituent outrage.
    Recent activity in the House Energy & Commerce Committee indicates 
that lawmakers are seriously mulling increased funding for the FTC as 
part of ongoing deliberations on the budget reconciliation package. In 
particular, the House Energy & Commerce Committee voted to approve $1 
billion in additional appropriations for the Commission to establish 
new a privacy bureau to conduct work ``related to unfair or deceptive 
acts or practices relating to privacy, data security, identity theft, 
data abuses, and related matters.'' \4\ In general, App Association 
members support vigorous management of the marketplace for bad actors, 
especially those that circumvent rules in a way that reduces overall 
trust in the app ecosystem or that threaten an even playing field in 
the marketplace. However, in this case, we believe that Congress should 
not act in half measures on privacy and that empowering the FTC with 
augmented capabilities to address privacy harms should take the form of 
a comprehensive Federal privacy regime. Simply establishing a new 
bureau with additional resources does little to enhance enforcement 
remedies, nor does it more clearly delineate the breadth and boundaries 
of the FTC's authority on privacy practices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ See Committee Print by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
Title III, Subtitle O, Sec. 31501, available at https://
privacyblogfullservice.huntonwilliamsblogs.com/wp-content/up
loads/sites/28/2021/09/BILLS-117pih-SubtitleO.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We also appreciate and understand the intent behind proposals 
originating in the House Energy & Commerce Committee to bolster the 
FTC's enforcement authority. At the same time, we continue to have 
concerns with granting the Commission, or any new regulatory body, 
general, undirected rulemaking authority to regulate privacy harms. The 
same concerns extend to even more general rulemaking authority to 
regulate all consumer protection harms under the FTC's purview. As 
we've previously written, we recommend providing only narrow rulemaking 
authority on the issue of privacy, as ``[t]he swath of the economy and 
range of economic activities'' any privacy regulator would oversee is 
``too broad for it to promulgate generally applicable rules that 
successfully balance the finer conflicts of purpose in the many sectors 
that would be subject to those requirements.'' \5\ A general grant of 
rulemaking authority to define unfair or deceptive acts or practices in 
or affecting commerce would completely delegate the exercise of 
defining limits to the Commission's own powers to the agency itself--a 
task better suited to Congress. A Democratic Congress imposed 
additional procedural hurdles on the Commission's rulemaking authority 
in 1980 \6\ for just this reason. The sheer breadth of its purview was 
better adapted for an adjudicative approach and invited overreach with 
rulemaking.

Anna Eshoo and the Honorable Zoe Lofgren, Members of Congress, re: 
Draft Framework of Online Privacy Act of 2019 (Jul. 18, 2019).
    \6\ See the Federal Trade Commission Improvements Act of 1980 (H.R. 
2313, 96th Cong.).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Aside from potential overreach and its relative unsuitability in 
regulating the dynamic markets the FTC oversees, general rulemaking 
also creates substantial uncertainty and potential instability. For 
example, an FTC controlled by one party might construct a carefully 
segmented regulatory regime, categorizing consumer protection harms by 
industry. The next Administration might have a completely different 
regulatory philosophy and scrap the framework entirely. Without 
guardrails in statute, challenges to such a complete deletion of 
regulations might fail--according to jurisprudence evaluating Federal 
agency decision-making, the courts grant ``Chevron deference'' to those 
interpretations.\7\ The less there is for an agency to interpret, the 
more leeway an agency has to define its own goals and decisions.\8\ The 
result could be massive swings in consumer protection regulation from 
one agency to the next (mainly unchecked by the courts), and in all 
likelihood, a more purposeful focus on political aims and headlines 
rather than targeting practices that are net harmful to consumers. Even 
where Congress has explicitly outlined regulatory goals and purposes, 
shifts in Administration have brought uncertainty, especially to more 
dynamic markets. The effect could be much worse without clear statutory 
guidance on the limits and purposes of FTC rules and enforcement.

    As Rob Coons, chief revenue officer of App Association member 
Walker Tracker--a platform for people to compete with each other on 
step challenges and similar wellness activities--points out, regulatory 
uncertainty falls heavily on small companies like his. For example, as 
states and governments overseas recently enacted new and differing 
general consumer privacy laws, Walker Tracker went back to the drawing 
board on its data processing agreements with employer clients. In turn, 
Walker Tracker now turns down contracts under a certain dollar 
threshold with smaller companies because the costs of uncertainty are 
too high to justify working on smaller contracts. Further privacy 
shifts at the state level coupled with regulatory pirouetting at the 
Federal level would only worsen the situation for Walker Tracker and 
other App Association members.
    We have similar concerns with granting the Commission broad civil 
penalty authority for any violation of the FTC Act, as legislation 
pending in the House would do. Although we support granting the 
Commission civil penalty authority for specific kinds of offenses, 
including as part of a general privacy bill, civil penalties for cases 
of first impression would chill innovation that has a net positive 
effect on consumer welfare. For example, when the Commission first 
encountered social media influencers, it quickly developed guidance 
outlining proper disclosures for influencers who receive compensation 
for endorsing products and services.\9\ A fast-developing business that 
blurred the lines between personal networking and advertising, 
``influencing'' cried out for FTC clarity on when it crosses the line 
into deception. If the FTC had civil penalty authority--providing up to 
$44,000 per violation--in cases where market participants have little 
notice as to where the line is for social media influencing, the cost 
of those potential penalties might have discouraged the practice 
altogether. Although influencing may have gained an unserious 
reputation,\10\ its emergence created legitimate livelihoods where none 
previously existed. And while authorizing civil penalties for first 
offenses--under the broad prohibitions in Section 5--would not 
necessarily cause the FTC to shoot first and ask questions later, it 
certainly could allow for such an enforcement approach.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The risk of such a regime falls especially heavily on small 
companies like App Association members. Marc Fischer, chief executive 
officer of App Association member Dogtown Media, says the prospect of 
civil penalties in undefined cases could cause longer timelines for 
product and service development and higher insurance costs. Dogtown 
Media is a mobile media development firm that has created more than 200 
apps on behalf of clients in a wide variety of industries, and like 
many of its peers, buys business risk insurance. As Marc points out, 
those costs would likely increase with the prospect of monetary 
penalties for first-time offenses, and the additional money he spends 
on those premiums should instead go toward hiring and business 
development.
    The concerns are especially acute where companies, like Dogtown 
Media, are forging cutting edge uses for advanced technologies like 
artificial intelligence (AI). Publicly traded firms with high-powered 
attorneys may be able to pay heavy fines and move on, but those 
penalties could deal a devastating financial blow to small companies 
like App Association members.
    Other reform proposals on the House side that would enhance the 
FTC's authority cause similar concerns for our member companies, 
although we would support these limited expansions in some forms in the 
context of a general privacy bill. For example, possible reforms could 
expand the FTC's jurisdiction to cover non-profit entities or expand 
FTC jurisdiction to cover common carriers under the Communications Act 
(telecommunications and wireless carriers, for example). It may make 
sense to enable the FTC to cover these kinds of entities in a more 
limited context like a general privacy bill, but we would be concerned 
about adding breadth to the FTC's purview generally. For Communications 
Act common carriers and non-profit entities, we have seen provisions in 
privacy bills that would place both categories into FTC jurisdiction--
while carving those common carriers out of Communications Act 
jurisdiction--for the purposes of the privacy law and regulations 
promulgated under it.\11\ The FTC is a more experienced privacy 
enforcer than the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), so it makes 
sense to task the FTC with monitoring privacy practices of wireless 
carriers instead of the FCC. The targeted treatment of 
telecommunications common carriers also avoids overlapping regulation 
of certain entities by multiple Federal agencies. App Association 
members demand high quality services at the lowest possible costs from 
Internet service providers and understand that subjecting them to 
duplicative regulatory compliance and penalties from multiple Federal 
agencies could increase costs and diminish service quality.

II. Congress Should Avoid Forcing the FTC to Stretch Its Own Authority
    Absent action from Congress to grant additional rulemaking 
authorities to the Commission, either through a comprehensive privacy 
law or otherwise, the Commission is likely to take it upon itself to 
reinterpret its existing authorities to better police the marketplace. 
While certainly an understandable impulse in the face of a rapidly 
evolving digital ecosystem and host of novel privacy harms, this 
direction also predictably produces suboptimal outcomes for businesses 
and consumers.
    The recent policy statement issued by the FTC interpreting its 
Health Breach Notification Rule is emblematic of the limitations and 
issues that can arise when the Commission stretches its limited powers 
beyond their intended purpose. During its most recent open meeting, FTC 
Commissioners voted 3-2 to approve a policy statement affirming that 
health apps and connected devices that collect or use consumers' health 
information must comply with the Health Breach Notification Rule. The 
FTC originally implemented its Health Breach Notification Rule in 
September 2009, as required as part of the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009, though it has yet to enforce the rule in its 
more than 10 years of existence. The rule requires that vendors of 
personal health records (PHRs) and their service providers notify 
consumers and the FTC when a breach of identifiable health information 
occurs. Failure to report such breaches carries civil penalties of up 
to $43,792 per violation per day.
    With its new policy statement, the Commission goes to great lengths 
to elide the difference between a beach of security and a privacy 
violation in hopes of expanding the rule's reach. Whereas the Health 
Breach Notification Rule plainly states that it exists simply to ensure 
that PHR providers and their service providers notify consumers ``when 
the security [emphasis added] of their individually identifiable health 
information has been breached,'' \12\ the policy statement asserts that 
whenever a health app discloses sensitive health information without 
users' authorization, this is a ``breach of security'' under the 
rule.\13\ Notably, the Final Rule included several examples to 
elucidate what exactly a data breach means, all of which reference 
instances where information is taken or stolen without the provider's 
knowledge.\14\ While we are sympathetic to the goal of preventing the 
unauthorized sharing of users' sensitive information and agree that 
there should be punishment when a company violates consumer trust, the 
fact remains a data breach notification law is an odd vessel to 
accomplish those goals.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The policy statement also stretches the definition of PHR, which is 
defined in the rule to mean ``identifiable health information on an 
individual that can be drawn from multiple sources [emphasis added] and 
that is managed, shared, and controlled by or primarily for the 
individual.'' The policy statement instead asserts that health apps are 
covered by the rule even when the health information they collect comes 
from a single source (such as an application programming interface) and 
the user themself inputs non-health data, such as through a separate 
calendar app. This directly contradicts existing FTC business guidance 
on the very topic, which states that ``[i]f consumers can simply input 
their own information on your site in a way that doesn't interact with 
personal health records offered by a vendor--for example, if your site 
just allows consumers to input their weight each week to track their 
fitness goals--you're not a PHR-related entity.'' \15\

Notification Rule, available at https://www.ftc.gov/tipsadvice/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Health Breach Notification Rule is simply a poor fit for 
policing first-party privacy violations, and the FTC's new 
interpretation could create numerous unintended consequences along the 
way. For example, since the notification standard in the rule is 
triggered when the entity discovers the breach, FTC's interpretation 
seemingly blesses the underlying unauthorized sharing of data so long 
as the provider proffers a notification after the fact. Or, instead, 
should the provider notify consumers when it first discovers its own 
plan to share the information with third parties? That either answer to 
the policy statement's unanswered question generates a non-sensical 
outcome speaks to the frailty of the Commission's interpretation.
    To be fair, the Commission is genuinely seeking to address a rather 
worrisome gap in our Nation's current privacy framework. And as 
Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter indicated, she looks forward to 
the Commission ``taking more action to limit the unfair collection and 
use of data, especially through rulemaking.'' \16\ Commissioners want 
to make the most of the authorities they have and we appreciate that 
they are focused on healthcare privacy in particular. The productive 
use of healthcare data no longer only occurs with healthcare providers 
and other entities under the jurisdiction of the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The creation and flow of 
healthcare data outside the HIPAA umbrella has accelerated, even more 
so during the COVID-19 pandemic, and although the FTC has been active 
in enforcing its Section 5 authority, it does not possess first time 
enforcement authority to punish particularly egregious offenders.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    These limitations were painfully illustrated in the recent 
settlement with Flo, a popular fertility and period tracking app that 
the FTC alleged shared the ``health information of users with outside 
data analytics providers after promising that such information would be 
kept private.'' \17\ Moreover, not only did Flo mislead consumers about 
its data sharing practices, but it also allowed third parties to use 
the data it shared for their own purposes.\18\ In some cases, this 
occurred in violation of the terms of service of those third parties, 
the data having been shared via software development kits (SDKs) they 
provided to Flo.\19\ These privacy missteps are especially concerning 
given the highly personal nature of the health information at issue.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Although Flo's core deceptive statements in this case enabled the 
FTC to enjoin further harmful conduct, existing statute limited the 
Commission's authority to wield monetary penalties to punish the 
company and signal to the marketplace that similar violations would not 
be tolerated. This is especially troublesome given that each and every 
headline detailing the deceptive conduct of firms using healthcare data 
outside the HIPAA umbrella threatens to further erode consumer trust, a 
key ingredient for success for our small business member companies. The 
healthcare innovations our member companies produce--from heart 
condition detection to chronic condition monitoring to simply managing 
digital health information across health systems--are far too important 
for us to let them fall victim to foundering consumer trust in digital 
health earned by bad actors.
    From our perspective, the answer is not for the FTC to create novel 
or tenuous interpretations of its existing rules nor is it to extend 
HIPAA to cover healthcare tools and services not currently subject to 
HIPAA. As we've shown, the Commission will inevitably encounter 
roadblocks as it seeks to retrofit old rules to address new use cases. 
Meanwhile, HIPAA's overarching purpose is to ensure the portability of 
health data between covered entities and business associates, and it 
was not primarily designed to give consumers better control over their 
own healthcare data or to manage the risks healthcare data processing 
poses.
III. Congress Should Enact a Federal Privacy Framework
    In our opinion, the best way to improve FTC enforcement 
capabilities within the privacy sphere is to specifically grant those 
authorities as part of a Federal privacy framework.
    We urge the Committee to establish a set of Federal requirements 
that puts in place baseline consumer rights and curbs data processing 
activities that expose consumers to undue privacy risks. For example, 
legislation introduced by the Committee chair and ranking member, as 
well as bipartisan draft legislation circulated by House Energy and 
Commerce Committee staff last year were a positive start representing 
substantial agreement on aspects of privacy that previously struggled 
for consensus. We urge you to continue the work on this effort and we 
stand ready to support negotiations and oversight activities around it.
    Specifically, the App Association supports a Federal framework with 
the following attributes:

   Transparency

     Federal privacy requirements should ensure businesses 
            are transparent about the collection and use of information 
            about consumers. App Association members compete on privacy 
            and work hard every day to develop better ways to 
            communicate with their users about privacy and give them 
            meaningful choices. Consumers should have a clear 
            understanding of the types of personal data they are 
            sharing, and which companies are using that data and how.

   Strong consumer rights

     A Federal law should empower consumers to exert more 
            control over their personal information, including the 
            rights to access, correction, and deletion of such 
            information. Sensitive personal information should also be 
            subject to some limits on processing activities that pose 
            too great a risk to consumers, which is not outweighed by 
            countervailing benefits.

   Accountability

     As the FTC has long argued, privacy should be built 
            into the design and functionality of products and services. 
            If privacy is a functional feature of a product or service, 
            the protections, notices, and options it provides may shift 
            and take on different forms depending on the context. 
            Federal law should support the dynamic functionality of 
            privacy by design by making companies accountable for sound 
            privacy practices while allowing them to innovate on the 
            details of their privacy programs.

   A single, national standard

     New privacy legislation in Congress should establish a 
            single, national standard and avoid creating a patent 
            troll-style business model for trial attorneys to sue and 
            settle with small companies through a broad private right 
            of action. Our member companies may include the smallest 
            software and connected device companies, but they each 
            serve consumers across the Nation and around the world. 
            Complying with a patchwork of state laws would be 
            unnecessarily burdensome because their activities are not 
            limited by any single state's borders. If privacy 
            legislation does include a preemption provision, we would 
            support limited rulemaking authority within statutory 
            guidelines and limits for the FTC and allowing state 
            attorneys general to enforce the bill's provisions.

   Scalable requirements

     Federal privacy requirements should be scalable 
            depending on the scope of an enterprise or data processing 
            activities and the size and compliance capabilities of 
            companies. App Association members do not want to be exempt 
            from requirements--they want to comply with strong, 
            flexible, and reasonable requirements.

    Additionally, though several promising frameworks passed into law 
this year at the state level, including in Virginia and Colorado, we do 
not recommend that Congress wait around until the states cobble 
together a privacy patchwork that covers the Nation. Despite recent 
progress, at the current pace of passage, it would take decades for the 
individuals of all 50 states to gain coverage. Needless to say, 
Congress should not stand by idly as data abuses continue to 
proliferate in the states that opt against or are unable to pass a law.
    Moreover, the more states that pass laws the greater the 
ambiguities and contradictions for businesses and consumers. Each of 
the three state privacy laws currently on the books include varying 
definitions for key terms, applicability thresholds, and sectoral 
exemptions. As more states enter the fray with their own laws, those 
nuances are only likely to multiply which makes compliance 
exponentially more difficult for businesses that operate across state 
lines (or have consumers in multiple states), while also increasing 
consumer confusion as to how their rights may or may not apply in a 
given scenario.
    Finally, each new state law also improves the odds of a dormant 
Commerce Clause challenge, especially insofar as a new law directly 
contradicts another state privacy law or takes aim at a specific 
industry.\20\ While this issue has yet to rear its head given the low 
number of state privacy proposals to make it from bill to law thus far, 
a constitutional challenge under the Commerce Clause could quickly 
stall the moderate progress at the state level bringing us back to 
square one. A preemptive Federal law is the only option that can avoid 
legal uncertainty, while effectuating uniform consumer rights across 
the Nation at the same time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IV. Congress Should Avoid Antitrust Measures that Presume the 
        Illegality of Platform -Level Privacy Protections
    Software platforms (app stores together with mobile operating 
systems) play a key role in managing an app ecosystem that offers 
consumers a wide variety of options, while minimizing privacy risks. 
These management functions form the core of the bundle of developer 
services App Association members purchase from platforms, without which 
consumer trust would be undermined. Some proposals in Congress, like 
the American Choice and Innovation Online Act (H.R. 3816) would 
presumptively prohibit these management functions, ostensibly to 
address complaints from competitors with alternative products and 
services on the platform. H.R. 3816 does this by prohibiting a software 
platform from conduct that ``excludes or disadvantages the products, 
services, or lines of business of another business user . . . relative 
to the [platform's] own'' \21\ offerings. While the bill would benefit 
some large competitors like Epic Games and Spotify, it would harm small 
app makers like App Association members as well as consumers because 
they would erode the trust consumers have in conducting digital 
commerce in the app marketplaces.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \21\ American Choice and Innovation Online Act (H.R. 3816, 117th).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    H.R. 3816's prohibitions create a presumption that many platform-
level privacy controls are illegal, which platforms could overcome only 
in especially narrow circumstances. The bill would essentially allow 
platforms to overcome that presumption only by showing that any measure 
they take was ``narrowly tailored, could not be achieved through a less 
discriminatory means, was nonpretextual, and was necessary'' \22\ to 
provide privacy. This construct is in tension with the FTC's focus on 
privacy by design and its privacy enforcement against bad actors on the 
app stores. It is also inconsistent with App Association members' calls 
for platforms to expeditiously remove harmful and fraudulent 
content.\23\ In fact, a recent FTC settlement illustrates how a 
statutory mandate for app stores to allow unvetted software onto smart 
device operating systems could harm consumers' privacy and security. On 
September 1, 2021, the FTC published an initial complaint, along with a 
unanimously approved settlement, with SpyFone.\24\ According to the 
complaint, SpyFone marketed itself as a surveillance app, enabling 
purchasers to track targets in a variety of ways, including by spying 
on live location, web history, contacts, pictures, calendar, files 
downloaded onto a device, notifications, e-mails, video chats, and even 
social media posts.\25\ The company explained to its users how to 
download the app on a target's device, hide the app so the target would 
not notice its presence, and bypass Android operating system controls 
in order to track the target without their knowledge.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Stalkerware apps could easily claim that iOS and Android have 
similar offerings because their legitimate uses, as marketed, involve 
parents managing their children's devices. In this scenario, Android 
clearly disadvantages SpyFone versus its own offerings by forcing it to 
go through onerous steps in order for a purchaser to make use of the 
app. For example, Android forces SpyFone to have its purchasers enable 
the sideloading capability, which triggers a warning from Android that 
``[i]f you download apps from unknown sources, your device and personal 
information can be at risk. Your device could get damaged or lose data. 
Your personal information could be harmed or hacked.'' \26\ Certainly, 
these additional steps and a warning like this hurt SpyFone's business. 
Likewise, iOS disadvantages SpyFone versus its own offerings because it 
does not allow SpyFone on iOS devices at all. And the affirmative 
defense H.R. 3816 provides in cases where a software platform needs to 
remove an app for violating a law or threatening consumer privacy does 
nothing to help because as drafted it is so inaccessible as to 
discourage any sort of reliance on it. The overall effect of H.R. 3816 
in the stalkerware context is to create a default rule barring the 
removal of stalkerware like SpyFone from a platform, as well as any 
privacy-related barriers that prevent stalkerware from taking advantage 
of consumers, unless a platform is able to overcome that presumption, 
likely in narrower forms, on a case-by-case basis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \26\ SpyFone Complaint at para. 6.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The bottom line is that taking a nondiscrimination sledgehammer to 
software platforms' role in removing bad actors rolls out the red 
carpet for apps like SpyFone. More importantly, by widening the avenues 
for fraudsters on app stores, an overbroad Federal nondiscrimination 
regime would narrow the path for smaller app makers like App 
Association members. It would also make the FTC's job in enforcing the 
statutory prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices that 
much more difficult, as more bad actors enter the fray and less of 
their activity is discoverable because platforms' hands would be tied. 
Meanwhile, as consumers adjust to a more fraud and malware-ridden 
marketplace, they would rationally shift away from experimentally 
downloading apps with the shortest histories and smallest preexisting 
distribution in favor of bigger brands. What is now a high trust 
environment, thanks in no small part to rigorous gating, would then 
evolve into a no-trust environment, which disproportionately harms 
smaller companies while benefiting the platform's largest ``business 
users.'' The effect would be similar with measures like the Open App 
Markets Act (S. 2710), which takes a narrower approach but still 
creates a presumption that platform gating functions to protect privacy 
are illegal.
    We urge the Committee to avoid measures like these in their current 
form, because they would move Federal privacy policy in the opposite 
direction from where it should be heading. Congress should not prohibit 
(or presume the illegality of) privacy controls that are proven to 
work; instead, it should require companies to adopt privacy 
protections. Otherwise, Federal law would undo the privacy-protective 
developments that enable online commerce, forcing consumers to accept a 
single, more open approach to security, or even worse, bring us back to 
an early 2000s online experience with fewer options, less meaningful 
privacy protections, and diminished security.
V. Conclusion
    We appreciate that the Committee seeks our views on approaches to 
bolstering the FTC's ability to address consumer privacy more 
effectively in the wide variety of industries it oversees and in which 
App Association members compete. Federal privacy law is overdue for an 
update to meet the challenges of the 21st century. App Association 
member companies want stronger Federal privacy requirements in 
particular, including a single set of national rules governing 
authorized data processing activities and data security practices. This 
Committee has made unprecedented bipartisan progress toward agreement 
on a national privacy law, and we urge that this hearing and further 
Committee activities help inform that process.

    The Chairwoman. Thank you to all the witnesses. I know 
there is a vote that has started, so I am going to ask my 
questions and then have Senator Wicker and Senator Baldwin ask 
theirs, and then I am going to run and vote, and then we will 
be back. And hopefully our colleagues who were over voting now 
will join us.
    I want to make something--I heard what everybody said in 
their testimony. So, but just so we have clarity. So do each of 
you support more resources at the FTC similar to what we have 
been talking about as it relates to this reconciliation item on 
the FTC having more of an enforcement--privacy enforcement 
authority? Professor Vladeck?
    Mr. Vladeck. Yes.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes, the FTC needs more resources.
    Mr. Reed. Yes, the FTC needs more resources.
    The Chairwoman. Mr. Soltani? Mr. Soltani, I am pretty 
sure--do you support more resources like a privacy bureau at 
the FTC?
    Mr. Soltani. Correct. Yes, I do.
    The Chairwoman. OK. So the question seems to be, and 
actually Ms. Ohlhausen, I also heard you also say you were for 
also first time civil penalties, so----
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes.
    The Chairwoman.--so everybody, I think, also agrees on 
that, is that right? Everybody agrees on first time civil 
penalties.
    Mr. Vladeck. Yes.
    The Chairwoman. Mr. Reed.
    Mr. Reed. Yes, as part of a Federal privacy law, I think 
that it is worthwhile to make that available.
    The Chairwoman. OK, so the issue is that right now we have 
a volume of cases, and we have a technology gap, and we don't 
have people to do compliance. So, while we are--what do we need 
to focus on when we say to the FTC, here are resources?
    Definitely want to talk about a new privacy law, but what 
do we need to focus on to make sure that the resources at the 
FTC really focus on these issues, when Mr. Soltani mentioned--I 
mean, my impression is we basically have been using current 
tools to enforce basically deception in current privacy 
practices and then having fines for failure--but as Mr. Soltani 
says, the compliance of that post that seems to be greatly 
lacking. So, Mr. Vladeck, what does this agency need to do to 
focus this?
    Mr. Vladeck. Well, as I said in my written testimony, the 
FTC needs resources. One area in which we need resources is 
being able to hire more technologists and engineers. I don't 
think the FTC has ever had a cohort as many as 10 technologists 
on staff. Ashkan was the second technologist we hired, and that 
was in 2009. So there is really no end to the need by the FTC 
for resources. But when it comes to enforcement, oversight of 
existing consent decrees, there is a division within the Bureau 
of Consumer Protection that has about 45 staff members that 
oversees more than 1,000 ongoing consent orders or litigated 
orders imposed by a court. And just the volume of orders that 
need to be sort of reviewed and subject to reporting 
requirements overwhelms the ability of staff to do the kind of 
surveillance of a company under orders that is required.
    And so this is one area where, you know, resources are 
desperately needed because, you know, take a look at Facebook. 
It is one of the first real major privacy orders we engaged in. 
We did not have technologists and staff who could spend time 
reviewing closely what the company was doing. And that is an 
endemic problem. And it is going to be an enduring problem 
unless Congress devotes more resources to the FTC.
    I was a triage nurse for four years, really. That was what 
I did. I tried to reallocate resources to the most dire, you 
know, to the most dire function that the FTC could----
    The Chairwoman. Well, I think that--I think I want to ask 
Mr. Soltani about this, because I worry that people are paying 
the fines and then going back to practices, knowing that we 
don't have time for compliance. And this is everywhere, you 
know, in the Federal Government. Senator Wicker and I had to 
work very hard on aviation reform, which was the same issue of 
what did the FTC--I am sorry, the FAA have as far as 
technologists to really understand the technology that they 
were reviewing.
    So we need an upgrade across the Federal Government, but 
clearly, if we want compliance on safety--Mr. Soltani, since 
you mentioned a broad group of people, but don't we just need 
basic people who understand software operations and technology?
    Mr. Soltani. It depends on the scope of the order. But 
absolutely, I think having expertise in, for example, the 
matters under order. So Facebook has a compliance program that 
they rely on a third party assessor for, and in some cases the 
FTC doesn't even automatically receive those. They have to 
request those assessments.
    But then you, as David mentioned, you need not only 
resources, but the right resources that can actually attest to 
whether these assessments are accurate, are done in the right 
scope, or even whether the assessor has the skills necessary. A 
lot of them are just checklists. So I think we need expertise, 
for example, on data security, APIs assessments in those groups 
overseeing the orders, compliance with the orders.
    The Chairwoman. Yes, I would--anyways, I would like to see 
a more formal list from somebody, but we will get--we will keep 
moving on the process and then seeing--yes, Senator--I mean, 
Mr. Vladeck.
    Mr. Vladeck. Yes, can I add just one quick thing. You know, 
in most privacy cases there is no fine or nothing in terms of 
redress for the first violation. There is no original fining 
authority because privacy harms, you know, are not monetary. 
You know, first--you know, the first violation is basically 
sort of, you know, consequence free other than the ongoing 
order.
    The Chairwoman. I will get to you, Mr. Reed, but I--Senator 
Wicker, go ahead and then I will get back to you when we come 
back. And then Senator Baldwin.
    Senator Wicker. Get your steps in, Senator Cantwell. Thank 
you very much. First of all, I have in my hand an article from 
today's Wall Street Journal, ``FTC Weighs New Online Privacy 
Rules'' by John D. McKinnon and Ryan Tracy, and I ask unanimous 
consent that it be placed in the record at this point. Hearing 
no objection--thank you.

Agency is looking at strengthening rules that govern how digital 
businesses collect user data

 By John D. McKinnon and Ryan Tracy--Updated Sept. 29, 2021 2:00 pm ET

    WASHINGTON--The Federal Trade Commission is considering 
strengthening online privacy protections, including for children, in an 
effort to bypass legislative logjams in Congress.
    The rules under consideration could impose significant new 
obligations on businesses across the economy related to how they handle 
consumer data, people familiar with the matter said. The early talks 
are the latest indication of the five-member commission's more 
aggressive posture under its new chairwoman, Lina Khan, a Democrat who 
has been a vocal critic of big business, particularly large technology 
companies.
    Congressional efforts to assist the FTC in tackling perceived 
online privacy problems was the focus of a Senate Commerce Committee 
hearing Wednesday. If the agency chooses to move forward with an 
initiative, any broad new rule would likely take years to implement.
    In writing new privacy rules, the FTC could follow several paths, 
the people said: It could look to declare certain business practices 
unfair or deceptive, using its authority to police such conduct. It 
could also tap a less-used legal authority that empowers the agency to 
go after what it considers unfair methods of competition, perhaps by 
viewing certain businesses' data-collection practices as exclusionary.
    The agency could also address privacy protections for children by 
updating its rules under the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection 
Act. And it could use its enforcement powers to target individual 
companies, as some privacy advocates urge.
    The FTC might choose not to move forward with any major privacy 
initiative. And action could be delayed as agency Democrats wait for 
confirmation of President Biden's newest nominee to the commission, 
privacy advocate Alvaro Bedoya.
    But since taking office June 15, Ms. Khan has made a number of 
moves to lay the groundwork for potential rule making, including by 
voting with the FTC's two other Democrats to change internal procedures 
to expand her control over the rule-writing process. Mr. Biden has 
ordered the FTC to look at writing competition rules in a number of 
areas, including ``unfair data collection and surveillance practices 
that may damage competition, consumer autonomy, and consumer privacy.''

lay the groundwork for potential rule making.

    This week, the progressive-leaning advocacy group Accountable Tech 
petitioned the agency to ban ``surveillance advertising'' as an unfair 
method of competition, defining the practice as targeted advertising 
based on consumers' personal data. As an example of the harms that an 
alleged lack of competition among online platforms can cause, the group 
cited a recent Wall Street Journal article about the impact of Facebook 
Inc.'s Instagram app on teens' mental health.
    ``The ability and incentive to extract more user data to unfairly 
monetize, even at the expense of children's wellbeing, has proven too 
great a competitive advantage for dominant surveillance advertising 
firms to pass up,'' the group's petition said.
    Facebook has said it faces stiff competition and that the Journal 
mischaracterized internal research on Instagram's impact. It said this 
week that it was pausing work on a version of the photo-sharing 
platform designed for children under 13.
    If the FTC decides to write a privacy rule, it would first have to 
publish a draft and seek public comment. In some circumstances, the law 
requires the agency to take additional, time-consuming steps such as 
asking for public input before even publishing a draft of a proposed 
rule.
    Such efforts could get a boost from congressional Democrats seeking 
more funding for the agency.
    Sen. Maria Cantwell (D., Wash.), who chairs the Commerce Committee, 
argued Wednesday for augmenting the FTC's resources to better address 
problems of the online economy.
    ``The truth is that our economy has changed significantly, and the 
Federal Trade Commission has neither the adequate resources nor the 
technological expertise at the FTC to adequately protect consumers from 
harm,'' she said in her opening statement.
    Some Republicans said it wouldn't make sense to add significant new 
funding to the FTC without passing new laws.
    Earlier this month, House Democrats proposed giving the FTC a $1 
billion budget to fund a new bureau dedicated to overseeing ``unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices relating to privacy, data security, 
identity theft, data abuses, and related matters.'' That proposal will 
be subject to negotiations as the narrowly Democratic-led Congress 
looks to pass a broad new spending plan this fall. Meanwhile, several 
Senate Democrats wrote to Ms. Khan on Sept. 20 asking her to write 
rules protecting consumers' privacy.
    The lack of a broad Federal law protecting consumers' privacy has 
become a bigger concern for advocates as online platforms and others 
have amassed vast troves of consumers' search data and other 
information. Many privacy advocates are particularly worried about 
children, who can be more vulnerable to targeted online advertising and 
attention-grabbing algorithms.
    Legislation to establish broad-based Federal privacy protections 
has stalled again in Congress this year over a range of concerns. 
Efforts to update an existing 23-year-old Federal privacy law covering 
younger children haven't gained significant traction among lawmakers.
    Critics say the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and the 
FTC-written rules that enforce it are ineffective and out-of-date, 
concerns that have helped lead the agency's newly empowered Democrats 
to focus more on taking further action on privacy.
    ``I think it's a really, really important area for attention,'' 
Democratic FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter has said of adopting 
broad-based privacy rules. She said at a July congressional hearing 
that a potential rule could target suspected online harms to children, 
adding, ``That is an issue that's near and dear to my heart.''
    Ms. Khan and fellow Democratic commissioners indicated at that 
hearing that the agency would be giving more attention to how platforms 
might be abusing children's privacy, as many kids have spent more time 
online during the Covid-19 pandemic. Democratic Commissioner Rohit 
Chopra added that the FTC should examine the underlying business models 
that can lead to privacy abuses.
    Republican Commissioner Christine Wilson has become an advocate for 
Federal privacy legislation, saying that consumers don't understand how 
their data is collected and monetized, creating what she terms a 
``market failure.''
    ``Without this information, they cannot analyze the costs and 
benefits of using different products and services,'' she said last week 
at Duke University. ``And the risks to consumers from the unchecked 
collection of their data have intensified in recent years.''

    Appeared in the September 30, 2021, print edition as `Federal Trade 
Commission Weighs Stronger Online Privacy Safeguards'.

    Senator Wicker. And it starts out, the Federal Trade 
Commission is considering strengthening online privacy 
protections, including for children, in an effort to bypass 
legislative logjams in Congress. Ms. Ohlhausen, have--this just 
came out this morning. Have you had a chance to read that?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. I haven't had a chance to read that. But I 
have heard some encourage that the FTC proceed through 
rulemaking.
    Senator Wicker. OK, and I take it from your testimony that 
you don't think that is a very good idea?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. I don't think it gives the FTC the necessary 
statutory authority from Congress.
    Senator Wicker. As you pointed out in your testimony. Mr. 
Vladeck seems like Ms. Ohlhausen makes a pretty good case that 
really the FTC should wait for Congress no matter how much of a 
logjam we have, that really is ideal that Congress act on this 
rather than the agency. What do you think about that?
    Mr. Vladeck. Well, I agree that Congress is the right body 
to finally decide what the law should be. I completely agree 
with that. I am not sure--and you know, and I don't think an 
FTC rule is anyone's first choice.
    Senator Wicker. And she makes up--she makes some pretty 
good points about what an FTC implemented rule would lack in 
terms of a force and effect. Do you agree with her on what she 
said in her statement?
    Mr. Vladeck. No, I think she's incorrect about the 
preemption issue. I think in the FTC rule promulgated under 
Section 18 would preempt State law that conflicts with the FTC 
rule. There is a lot of Supreme Court jurisprudence on 
preemption. That one issue, I think Ms. Ohlhausen is incorrect.
    Senator Wicker. That is a pretty powerful agency that can 
do that. What do you think, Mr. Reed? Have had--have you read 
the article? Anyone read the article?
    Mr. Reed. Well, we have jumped off on to the rulemaking. I 
think when it comes to the protection of children online, we 
have been a strong supporter of the Children's Online Privacy 
Protection Act. One of the things, though, that I was, and I 
will repeat this for the chair is, it is worth noting that on 
all of these rules, we run into a situation where we are all 
talking about compliance.
    To me in a small business capacity compliance means 
lawyers. That doesn't mean developing products. That doesn't 
mean people doing the job that they need to do. So what really 
the FTC needs to have as part of this resource is to make sure 
they are doing a better job educating people what the rules 
are, how you follow them, what the expectations are, and get 
back some of that trust. Because if we are only focused on 
compliance, that means I am hiring a lawyer, not the other.
    On onto your question about a patchwork of State laws, 
somebody asked me earlier said, well, is a patchwork of State 
laws going to--doesn't that create a floor, not a ceiling? And 
I said from a small business perspective, that turns the floor 
into lava, and you are hopping from couch to couch to trying to 
figure out where you comply and how you comply. While I 
understand that there is jurisprudence, as Professor Vladeck 
said, from a small business perspective, the cost of figuring 
out where you sit on that jurisprudence is incredibly expensive 
and time consuming.
    So, no, I think preemption is absolutely key for the small 
business success. And we can't depend on a hopeful Supreme 
Court decision down the road.
    Senator Wicker. And perhaps Mr. Soltani can answer on the 
record because that clock seems to keep ticking. Let's talk 
about the inclusion of a private right of action in data 
privacy legislation. Oftentimes, a private right of action 
hinders innovation, consumer choice, and ends up benefiting 
trial lawyers rather than consumers. For the record, and we 
will start again with Ms. Ohlhausen, and talk to all four of 
you.
    How would a broad private right of action and data privacy 
legislation impact member companies, particularly small app 
developers, and what do you think about a private right of 
action where consumers can recover actual monetary damages 
where an individual has suffered concrete harm? Let's start 
with Ms. Ohlhausen but we'll take time for all four of you.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. So I would support a private right of action 
that allows a consumer to get actual damages. I think concerns, 
you know, are appropriate for a very broad type of right of 
action as the way we have seen that used when it has been in 
other statutes, where it really hasn't serve consumer interests 
well and it is certainly been a big burden on businesses, 
including small businesses, who have to spend a lot of money, 
you know, defending against----
    Senator Wicker. What would you--what would you allow and 
what would you not allow? Can you help us make a distinction 
there?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Sure. So I have some concerns about having 
something that has high punitive damages for an initial 
violation of the Act, particularly of something that, you know, 
doesn't have like, you know, a bad intent. If you had something 
that was, you know, really focused on repeated or egregious 
violations, that focused on making consumers whole and 
protecting consumers going down the road, I think that is the 
appropriate focus for a private right of action.
    Senator Wicker. Mr. Vladek.
    Mr. Vladeck. I think private rights of action are essential 
to enforcement, but I think there are ways of addressing the 
concerns that you and others have raised. So, for example, the 
Federal Privacy Act has a private right of action. It only 
permits nominal damages unless there are actual damages. And 
under the Equal Access to Justice Act, it curbs the amount of 
attorney?s fees that can be recovered.
    And so there are ways of both providing a right of action 
which would be essential to real enforcement but minimize the 
kinds of concerns that you and my colleagues here today have 
raised. Look at the Federal Privacy Act. It has been in effect 
since 1974. It has worked quite well, but it has a private 
right of action. It allows nominal damages, and it curbs 
attorneys' fees.
    Senator Wicker. Mr. Reed, what about your small members?
    Mr. Reed. So, Professor Vladeck mentioned some guardrails, 
but I think if we are going to have a private right of action, 
guardrails are the key aspect. Obviously, injunctive relief--
injunctive relief would probably be ideal. But if we are 
limiting it to just monitor actual monetary damages, not 
statutory, I think the two problems small businesses are going 
to see is without a period to cure, you run the risk of I 
didn't respond to that e-mail in 30 days, I responded to it in 
31 days.
    That should not lead to a sue and settle situation where I 
have got to pay someone--I have got to pay someone $50,000 for 
that. So there has to be a period of cure. The other thing that 
we have heard from everybody is the concept of C-enter. There 
has got to be some kind of intent behind it. A missed deadline 
for responding to a request shouldn't be the kind of thing that 
leads you into an expensive court case. So guardrails are the 
key aspect.
    Senator Wicker. Mr. Soltani, is a period of cure OK with 
you?
    Mr. Soltani. Yes, I think that the cure provision does 
provide some guardrails, as Mr. Reed outlined, and we have that 
in California. I will say that those guardrails, though, need 
to be specific, not just based on the size of the company, 
because oftentimes small companies will actually affect and 
reach millions of consumers and handle sensitive data like 
health information or period tracking apps.
    So I am not sure that just the size of it alone--it has to 
be a consideration based on, as others have said, the nature of 
the harm and the severity if the information does breach. You 
know, at the end of the day, the private right of action makes 
up for the concern if there is not enough enforcement capacity. 
So I think as long as there are ways to ensure that the laws 
and regulations are properly overseen and enforced and there is 
resources to do so, I think that will balance the private right 
of action as well.
    Senator Wicker. Thank you. Senator Baldwin, take the gavel 
and take 8 minutes if you need to. We will hold up----
    [Laughter.]

               STATEMENT OF HON. TAMMY BALDWIN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN

    Senator Baldwin. I have noted in previous hearings in this 
committee about data privacy that I am not sure that my 
constituents really differentiate between a company's decision 
to use their data or give it to others in ways that they didn't 
expect or agree to, and a company's failure to keep that data 
secure from third-party criminals who steal it. Unfortunately, 
since our last hearing on this topic, we have seen a lot more 
large scale data breaches and ransomware attacks that endanger 
consumers' personal and financial information and threaten the 
operations of critical businesses and services.
    So I am pleased that the legislative proposals introduced 
by the leaders of this committee tackle the issue of data 
security as part of the broader data privacy issue. Ms. 
Ohlhausen, during your tenure at the FTC, the agency dealt with 
a number of major data breaches. How critical do you believe it 
is that Congress tackle data security alongside sort of hand in 
hand with data privacy issues? And what in particular is the--
is it most important for Congress to do in the data security 
lane?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Thank you, Senator. I think you are correct 
that there is a fine distinction between data privacy and data 
security, but they are very closely related. And I think it is 
important that Federal legislation tackle both.
    And some of the provisions that have been in the bills 
require companies to have processes in place to ensure that the 
data is protected, that they also might be subject to fines if 
they don't, because that is--you know, as my colleague, Mr. 
Vladeck said, sometimes the harms from a data breach aren't 
necessarily financial harm.
    Sometimes they are, but they aren't always. And so you want 
to be able to have the right incentives in place for companies 
to take those protections. And I think legislation that looks 
at both privacy and data security helps kind of cover both 
sides of that.
    Senator Baldwin. Thank you. All of you have testified about 
the need for the FTC to have greater resources and in 
particular, technologists, engineers. And so I want to--I had a 
question on that, but you pretty much put that on the record. I 
do want to ask something more specific about it, though, and I 
will direct this to Mr. Soltani. In your testimony, you 
recommended that the FTC grow its staff of technologists, 
provide them with more competitive pay, allow them to engage in 
meaningful work that would not prevent them from seeking future 
employment elsewhere.
    While I agree, and there seems to be a strong consensus on 
the panel that the Commission needs substantially more staff, 
resources, and authority to effectively address data privacy 
and security, I also have long standing concerns about 
revolving doors--a revolving door between Federal regulatory 
agencies and the industries that they regulate.
    So how would you suggest we go about approaching that, 
strengthening the FTC's ability to effectively engage with an 
ever changing and expanding technology sector while also trying 
to avoid industry capture?
    Mr. Soltani. Thank you, Senator, for the question. 
Absolutely in agreement with you regarding the revolving door 
we see, and this committee is intimately familiar with staff 
going to large tech companies and working after the fact once 
they gain that expertise here. The comment in my testimony and 
I have coauthored a paper on this, has to do with the way 
contract rules apply to technologists.
    And I also said in my testimony, often technologists--when 
I was at the Commission, I worked on nearly every case at DPIP 
at the time. So I was working hands on, on many cases. And so 
as such, it essentially creates enhanced conflict rules, 
particularly based on the way the FTC interprets their conflict 
authority. And furthermore, they apply those conflict rules not 
just to working with the companies that are under order but 
working with other enforcement agencies.
    For example, I worked firsthand on the Facebook matter in 
2010 as one of the lead investigators, technologists in the 
matter. I was prohibited by the FTC from helping a multi-State 
AG action on the same matter because they considered that to be 
in the conflict rules even though it was on the same side of 
consumer protection, and it would be essentially seeking 
injunctions or remedies that the FTC themselves didn't seek.
    So I think there is some work that needs to be done, but 
absolutely with the focus that this can't be a revolving door. 
In the same way that we want to prevent a revolving door, not 
just for staff attorneys, but for Commissioners as well.
    Senator Baldwin. Thank you.
    The Chairwoman. Thank you, Senator Baldwin. I know Senator 
Fischer is here, but you are allowing your colleague, Senator 
Moran, for a time constraint, sensitive issue to go remotely 
ahead of you. So, thank you. Senator Moran. Senator Moran, are 
you available? Maybe he already had to depart for his--well, we 
will give it a minute here. Give it a second. See if we can get 
it corrected. If not, would it be OK if we went to Senator 
Tester, and then back to Senator Moran, is that OK? OK, Senator 
Tester.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Senator Tester. Well, goodness, thank you. This is a 
question for--actually, it is a question for the panel. We have 
witnessed the FTC fine some larger tech companies a pile of 
money in my book, billions of dollars. Number one, do you think 
this enforcement is effective? And number two, if you don't 
think it is effective, because, quite frankly, I think it is a 
drop in the bucket to some of these companies, but if you don't 
think it is effective, what should the FTC be doing? We will 
start with you, Mr. Vladeck.
    Mr. Vladeck. You know----
    [Technical problems.]
    The Chairwoman. If you could turn your microphone on, I am 
not sure, or pull it closer.
    Mr. Vladeck. Thank you. I think $5 billion actually is a 
bucket of money. And having litigated cases for 45 years, I 
doubt, seriously the FTC would have gotten that kind of civil 
penalty in litigation. But here's the problem. For most privacy 
violations, there is no financial, you know, harm to the 
company. They don't pay a penny in most privacy violations. 
Why? Because it is not money. And the FTC, of course, redress 
authority was clipped by the Supreme Court in AMG. But for 
first time violators, the only real sanction is an ongoing 
consent decree.
    And as--we talked about this a little earlier, Senator 
Tester, but part of the problem is the FTC has got 1,000 
companies and people under order. And monitoring those consent 
decrees, it takes a lot of time and resources, which the FTC 
lacks. And so the real problem is once you get a company under 
order and during my tenure at the FTC and Maureen's, we got a 
lot of these companies under order.
    The real question is, does the FTC have the resources to 
make certain the company is following the consent decree? And 
the answer to that question is plainly no.
    Senator Tester. Yep.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. So I agree, I think $5 billion is a big fine 
and is actually much larger than--we often hold up Europe as 
sort of this paradigm for privacy and it far dwarfs anything 
they have ever obtained there. But I think the other part that 
you need to look at is the conduct obligations that are in that 
order.
    And so when you look at legislation and the ability to 
impose some of those kinds of obligations on all companies, I 
think that is why Federal legislation could be really a good 
path forward, not just unfair and deceptive acts and practices 
enforcement, which, again, I think the FTC has done a good job 
with, given the limitations that that has.
    Mr. Reed. So from the small business perspective, $5 
billion is a lot of money. However, what you are really asking 
is, did it create behavior change? And the practical mention is 
we keep talking about compliance. Well, without Federal 
legislation, you are never going to see--you are never going to 
see behavior change, because what the companies are doing is 
they are looking at what the length and breadth of the law are 
and figuring out how close they can come to the line to comply 
and then figure they will fight it out in court and delay it.
    So until the Congress comes in and steps in and says this 
is what is appropriate, this is what people--what their 
expectations are, and restore some trust to the system, then it 
is always going to be a matter of $5 billion. So as Ms. 
Ohlhausen said, really, it is up to Congress to actually give 
the FTC the tools they need. But if you want behavior change, 
it starts with you.
    Senator Tester. Mr. Soltani, would you like to comment?
    Mr. Soltani. I would agree with what the previous panelists 
have said. Indeed $5 billion may be a lot of money depending on 
the company, however, the kind of the core behavior change 
comes about not only from the fine, but also any injunctions or 
restrictions that are imposed on the company.
    In the case of the--from the Facebook settlement, not only 
were there very limited injunctions on the behavior of the 
company, the settlement indemnified the company for all 
violations prior to the settlement date, which there is some 
evidence that there was a number of other ongoing violations at 
the time, which the FTC then loses its ability to oversee or 
enforce.
    So I think in addition to statutory fines, I think it is 
important to have strong, meaningful injunctions, which then 
the agency can, in fact, enforce. And that goes to the resource 
question as well as the authority question.
    Senator Tester. Several of you, if not all of you, have 
talked about the fact that they don't have--the FTC does not 
have enough money to do what we think they should be doing. The 
House marked up a bill that gives them basically $100 million a 
year for 10 years to create a new privacy bureau. I am curious, 
and I would love to ask you all this question, but I only got 
13 seconds left. So I will just ask you, Mr. Vladeck, since you 
are closest to me, what should we be looking at as far as the 
funding level for the FTC?
    Mr. Vladeck. I think an additional $100 million a year is a 
good start. It would move the FTC to parity with some of its 
other sister agencies, but I am not sure that is actually 
enough. I mean, when we start--the first time we see Google, 
they had 600 lawyers.
    Today, I don't know, probably over 1,000. You know, we are 
not ever outgunned, but we are always outmatched in terms of 
resources. And as the tech sector grows and it is the most 
dynamic sector of our economy, the FTC is going to need 
resources commensurate with that. So I think $100,000--$100 
million is a good start, but I don't think that is the end of 
the story.
    Senator Tester. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    The Chairwoman. Thank you, Senator Tester. Senator Moran, 
are you now available? Senator Fischer.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DEB FISCHER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA

    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and to our 
witnesses for being here today. This committee has had 
productive discussions on data privacy in recent years. And on 
several occasions, we have heard directly from FTC 
Commissioners past and present, and from both parties for that 
matter. What struck me from those conversations was that while 
many Commissioners had different recommendations, they 
consistently pointed to one area of agreement, and that is the 
need for Congress to clearly define authorities and boundaries 
for FTC rules in statute. Commissioner Ohlhausen, do you think 
it makes sense for lawmakers to throw as much as $1 billion at 
a new privacy bureau as some are trying to do without passing 
corresponding legal authorities for FTC enforcement?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. I think you really need both. You need more 
resources financially and you need stronger statutory guidance 
and clarity for the FTC to enforce. Because if it keeps trying 
to enforce in a way that doesn't quite match up with the 
authority Congress gave it, it is always going to be at a 
disadvantage.
    Senator Fischer. Without the right legal tools provided by 
legislation, I am afraid that this funding would waste taxpayer 
money on unsuccessful agency litigation that would ultimately 
fail, and it is not going to protect consumers in any way.
    Mr. Vladeck, I noticed in your testimony you mentioned 
digital harms that are related, but beyond the immediate 
privacy space, such as dark patterns. I am working to 
reintroduce the Detour Act with Senator Warner, prohibiting the 
use of dark patterns that trick consumers into giving consent 
online. How do you think that legislation addressing these 
manipulative user interfaces could improve the FTC's ability to 
protect consumers online?
    Mr. Vladeck. Well, first, you know, the FTC protects 
consumers online largely through litigation. And unless the FTC 
has the resources that it needs today, the FTC is not going to 
be able to do that. In terms of dark patterns, there is a 
difficult--there is a really difficult First Amendment question 
there. The question is, what is the difference between advocacy 
and manipulation?
    And I think the trick that you and your colleagues are 
going to have are going to be to craft legislation that gets 
out--really gets after the kind of manipulation that you are 
worried about without, you know, without trenching on First 
Amendment rights. So I applaud what you are doing, but I think 
you have a very difficult road ahead of you.
    Senator Fischer. I am also very troubled by the recent Wall 
Street Journal reports that describe Instagram's mental health 
effects on its users, particularly young girls. This follows 
our concerns about Facebook previous mood studies that they did 
to manipulate users' emotions that came to light in 2014.
    The DETOUR Act seeks to address consumer harms like these, 
as well as by banning online behavioral studies without 
informed consent and banning certain dark patterns aimed at 
children. How would you tie in your previous comments on First 
Amendment issues to be careful about, to be cautious about, on 
those instances?
    Mr. Vladeck. I am deeply troubled by the Wall Street 
Journal reports about Facebook. You know, anyone who has ever 
raised children, I think, particularly in this digital age, 
should be worried about it. I think the Constitutional issues 
definitely are less substantial when you are trying to protect 
minors.
    And you know and the FTC enforces COPPA. I would like to 
see changes to COPPA. The COPPA statute is very difficult to 
enforce because of the actual knowledge standard. I would hope 
Congress could wrestle with that question as well. But I agree 
with you, we need tighter regulation to protect our kids.
    Senator Fischer. How can we aid you in that enforcement? 
You know, when we are looking at consumer harm, can you give me 
a couple of examples of areas that you think we need to focus 
on in order to aid you in that enforcement? What are some of 
your ideas? What do we need? What do you need?
    Mr. Vladeck. Well, the first--if we are talking about 
children, COPPA needs to be revised. I helped work on the 2000, 
you know, 2011, 2012 rethink of COPPA, and we were constrained 
by the statute. The hardest problem for the FTC is the actual 
knowledge standard that it requires us to prove from the get-go 
that an app developer website actually understood that it was 
tracking children, even though, you know, there is a lot of 
circumstantial evidence that would have proven constructive 
knowledge.
    So the first thing I would do about COPPA is change the 
standard from actual knowledge to constructive knowledge. The 
second thing I would do is get rid of the safe harbor programs. 
They give people one serious bite at the apple without FTC 
oversight. I do not think the Safe Harbor program has worked 
particularly well. And the last thing is I think there needs to 
be a rethink about the age limit. I don't know whether, you 
know--Senator Markey is not here. I don't know--oh, oh, there 
you are, Senator.
    The Chairwoman. He is pretending to be a staffer.
    Mr. Vladeck. Oh, I apologize.
    The Chairwoman. He is so knowledgeable. He is at the staff 
level of knowledge. He is so smart.
    Mr. Vladeck. Well, I mean, in some ways he was remarkably 
prescient. The statute goes back to 1999. But I think that we 
need to rethink what the right age is.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
    The Chairwoman. Thank you, Senator Fischer. Is Senator 
Klobuchar available? She may--she has been trying----

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. Can you hear me, Madam Chair?
    The Chairman. Yes. Yes, Senator Klobuchar.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you. I am 
going to Senator, a former Senator wife's funeral, and I 
apologize for just being on the phone here. I am on the bus, 
but I really wanted to be part of this important hearing. And I 
thank you for your leadership, Senator Cantwell and so many 
others.
    Mr. Soltani, in your testimony in opening, you highlight 
probably FTC's Division of Privacy and Identity Protection has 
only about 40 attorneys as compared to other countries' data 
protection agencies such as Germany, with one-quarter of the 
U.S. population, with nearly 745 staff. You also note how a new 
FTC privacy bureau would provide the agency with the resources 
it needs. Can you elaborate on how this bureau will help build 
upon the agency's work to protect consumer privacy?
    And I would also add to that, Senator Grassley and I, of 
course, have a bill that would help both the FTC and DOJ 
antitrust, when it comes to antitrust enforcement that is 
passed the Senate. And there is also efforts to beef up the 
resources on that side of the work, which I think does lead 
into privacy because, you know, there is no incentive to do a 
lot on privacy when there is only one competitor in a dominant 
platform. So could you address both things, Mr. Soltani? Thank 
you.
    Mr. Soltani. Absolutely. I think, as I said before, 
regulation and even Section 5, without adequate enforcement and 
oversight, is just dead letter. And effectively the enhanced--
kind of the creation of this new agency plus the staffing 
expert resources--sorry, the creation of this new bureau with 
staffing of key resources will help the agency not only kind of 
enforce and oversee the myriad of harms we are concerned about, 
but in fact go after a number of companies rather than just one 
or two at a time. And as you know, often these matters take 
years to complete.
    So it gives the ability to, for the agency to actually 
oversee more of what you are all concerned about. To your 
second point, absolutely, privacy and antitrust are deeply 
related. I don't think you could solve one without solving the 
other. And I do think that efforts to try to deal with some of 
the market failure resulting in some of the privacy abuses is 
critical.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much. Professor Vladeck, 
I recently held a hearing in antitrust about consumer data and 
how literally so much information feeds into the profiteering 
of the tech companies that's off of consumers' back. I think 
Facebook makes their own reports $50 bucks a quarter from each 
user in America. And so could you talk about how a large data 
set held by a small handful of companies can raise competitive 
concerns such as barriers to entry?
    Mr. Vladeck. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. I do think 
these enormous reservoirs of personal data, which are 
constantly being updated frictionlessly with no cost to the 
companies, is an enormous asset that is a barrier to entry and 
is a barrier to rivals trying to replicate these kinds of data 
banks. And so I think that, you know, I agree with you that 
these aggregations of enormous amounts of sensitive personal 
data are an enormous asset. Of course, the accounting industry 
hasn't really caught up to this, but we have at the FTC. And, 
you know, the frictionless acquisition of personal data on an 
ongoing basis is an enormous advantage in this marketplace and 
will freeze out rivals.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK, thank you. Last question. Ms. 
Ohlhausen, there is a lot of concern about health technologies. 
I have done work with Senator Murkowski on this and many 
others, whether it is tracking apps, whether it is Halo, you 
name it. Could you just briefly talk about that? Thank you.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Thank you, Senator. Your question was a 
little hard to hear. So----
    The Chairwoman. Halo. Halo Technology.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Halo Technology? OK, I am not actually 
familiar with Halo Technology, so--but I will say the FTC has 
been active in paying attention to apps that are 
surreptitiously tracking consumers. They recently brought some 
enforcement actions in that area. I think that that is 
something that, you know, going back to our time with David, 
the Golden Shore's flashlight app, where they were collecting 
data. You know, they said it was a flashlight, it worked as a 
flashlight, but it collected data and consumers didn't know 
that.
    So I think--designer wear, yes. So there is--so I think 
that that is an area where the FTC has been active, continues 
to be active, and certainly any legislation should address 
those kinds of concerns as well, because if there is sensitive 
data that is being collected unknown to consumers, you know, 
that is that is an issue. There should be an opt-in consent 
there.
    The Chairwoman. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. 
Senator Scott.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. RICK SCOTT, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA

    Senator Scott. First of all, I want to thank Chair Cantwell 
for hosting this important hearing. Online platforms and big 
tech companies actively track, collect, and sell the data of 
Americans, often without their users' knowledge or consent. I 
think all of us are alarmed by this, and it is an infringement 
on Americans' privacies. Our job in Congress is to hold these 
companies accountable and protect the rights of all Americans.
    There are privacy policy frameworks in the EU and states 
like California that purport to give more ownership of data to 
users. But I am concerned that these frameworks do not actually 
give individuals more control of their data and burdened small 
businesses do not have the legal and compliance resources of 
big tech. Congress needs a thorough review and reform existing 
privacy law to make sure Americans have more control and 
transparency about how their data is being used, as well as the 
ability to protect their data. I have a bill, the DATA Act, 
which would require big tech platforms like Facebook, Snapchat, 
and Twitter, to receive expressed consent to use American's 
personal information and also provide a recourse for Americans 
if the right to privacy is violated.
    I think this bill is a step in the right direction to give 
Americans greater transparency and control of their personal 
information. To all the witnesses, thank you for being here. If 
we pursue Federal legislation, how can Congress ensure it is 
carefully crafted to ensure that small businesses do not face 
burdensome new requirements?
    Mr. Reed. Well, I guess as--from the small business 
perspective, I will start, Senator Scott. There are some basic 
guardrails that need to be in place around any private right of 
action. Specifically, we talked about it earlier, the baseline 
concepts have to be that it cannot be a private right of action 
that would result in, for example, a small business getting an 
e-mail from someone and responding to it in 31 days instead of 
30 days.
    We need a period of cure. We need to be held to the point 
where there was no intent to harm and there is a way to clarify 
or fix the problem and get right with our consumer, because at 
the core, the small business needs the consumer trust. We don't 
have the big brands of a Facebook. We actually need our 
consumers to trust us. And so setting up a system of PRA that 
becomes sue and settle, where the cost of going to court to 
defend myself is $500,000 but paying off the lawyer $50,000 
becomes a cost of doing business.
    So I would say that, as you have heard from all the 
panelists, there is support for some kind of PRA, but it needs 
to have guiderails to respect the realities of small business. 
And those start with making sure that we can fix the problem 
and make sure we are on the right side of trust with our 
customers.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Senator, I also agree that we need to come 
up with a system that doesn't overburden small business. 
Regulatory complexity makes it very difficult. So having a 
uniform national law that sets out clear standards, clear 
obligations, I think will go a long way toward reducing that 
complexity for small businesses.
    Mr. Vladeck. Senator, I share your concern about 
overburdening small businesses, but one of the things that we 
need to take into account is in the digital space, a small 
business can create massive harm. And the FTC saw cases like 
that. And so I do think that, you know, you have a fair point, 
but you need to craft legislation that, you know, that is 
commensurate with the amount of harm that can be caused. And so 
there were cases that we litigated when I was at the FTC, frost 
wire, designer wear, where there were app developers that could 
really just create massive harm. And so we need to--we need to 
balance those two factors, Senator.
    Mr. Reed. And just to followup, I actually agree. I think 
small businesses can have data pools that are very significant 
and therefore the harm that they cause can be serious. The 
questions of the ability to cure, the ability to solve the 
problem, the ability to regain trust is true regardless of 
size, but it is more profoundly felt by small businesses. It is 
one of the reasons why we need preemptive Federal legislation 
to help us, you know, get the trust of our users.
    Senator Scott. Thank you. What can we--how can----
    Mr. Soltani. Senator----
    Senator Scott. Go ahead.
    Mr. Soltani. If I may. So, I agree with you, and I agree 
with the previous panelists that in fact the burden on small 
business and innovation should be considered. In California, we 
have a threshold which considers not only the company size, for 
example, if it has an annual gross revenue of over $25 million, 
but also the amount of data that it sells or shares, for 
example, over 50,000 consumers, which is updated in the CPRA. 
The--you know, to Professor Vladeck's earlier point, oftentimes 
small businesses may still handle and deal with a lot of 
personal information, sensitive personal information.
    So we need to have a framework that is flexible enough to 
deal with the compliance issues as Mr. Reed just pointed out, 
but also deal with the harms that can come about around a fast, 
rapidly growing business. Think about Twitter. When the FTC 
brought the order against Twitter, they were at that time 
perhaps a small business, but that impacted quite a lot of 
people's lives in 2009, 2010.
    Senator Scott. Thank you, Chair Cantwell.
    The Chairwoman. Thank you. Thank you so much. Senator Moran 
tried to join us earlier and now he is available. Senator 
Markey is it OK if--he is trying to get to the same funeral our 
colleagues are trying to attend, and I--we all mourn the loss 
of Evan Bayh's wife, and so I guess they are having a memorial 
service this morning for her. So, Senator Moran, would you like 
to try to connect here?

                STATEMENT OF HON. JERRY MORAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM KANSAS

    Senator Moran. Chairman, I thank you very much, assuming 
you can hear me. Thank you for your assistance in allowing me 
to testify, but it is hugely an important issue to me and to 
the country and issue that I and you and Senator Blumenthal and 
Senator Wicker have spent a lot of time on. I have a couple of 
questions. I guess I will begin with Commissioner Ohlhausen and 
Mr. Vladeck. There seems to be significant agreement on what a 
comprehensive data privacy bill should include, but there is 
still a few sticking points, and they are certainly difficult 
ones. One of those serious ones is the remaining issue of 
whether to include the private right of action. And if so, what 
form should that take? Where do you believe we can find common 
ground on this particular issue? Commissioner.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Senator, thank you for your question. I do 
think there can be common ground found on private right of 
action, as we have--I think fellow panelists have also talked 
about, having a private right of action that is very focused, 
that does not invite abusive litigation. That is focused on 
getting actual redress to consumers rather than just generating 
attorneys' fees. So I think that, you know, that and my 
colleague suggested the Federal Privacy Act as a model and 
definitely would want to take a look at that.
    Senator Moran. Thank you.
    Mr. Vladeck. Let me just quickly add one thing. A privacy 
bill needs to be enforced, and the only effective real 
mechanism of enforcement are private right of actions. Now, 
there are concerns about frivolous litigation or excessive 
costs. There are statutes that deal with that kind of question. 
The Privacy Act is just one, but there are ways of limiting 
recoveries to nominal damages and actual damages and to cap 
attorney?s fees as the U.S. Government does when it is involved 
in litigation under the Equal Access to Justice Act. So those 
are solvable problems.
    Senator Moran. I take that as encouragement as we have 
tried to solve them for about 2 years now. Let me ask Mr. Reed 
before I need to go. You know Colorado--Virginia, Colorado, 
they have enacted data privacy legislation and we call that up 
concerned about a patchwork of laws. We have been warned 
previously steadily about a reality of increasing pressure on 
Congress as more states adopt those State laws.
    What about the nature of doing business on the Internet 
makes it untenable for businesses to operate in an environment 
with different states, where different States have different 
privacy standards?
    Mr. Reed. I think I caught most of that, but the answer, 
Senator, would be--well, Virginia and Colorado bills were both 
excellent bills, but ideally a Federal preemption would be 
better for some simple reasons. Even within the confines of 
those two plus California plus a few other states, there are 
terms and specific differences between there. As you know, in 
breach was a classic example. There are 47 different breach 
bills in some states. If you got a request from law 
enforcement, you needed to wait to tell the customer that it 
happened. In another state, you had a situation where you 
needed to tell the customer immediately and then inform law 
enforcement. For small businesses, that kind of compliance 
regime, the same thing in privacy of how do I see consent?
    For example, if one state says the size of your belt is 
biometrics, then I need to get your consent if I want to know 
your belt or shoe size, because I am an app that helps you buy 
shoes. In another state, biometrics may be defined as a retinal 
scan or a fingerprint. So from a small business perspective, it 
is not just the language of the bills, but it is the way the 
definitions are done, the way the report language in each state 
is done.
    And that raises our compliance costs and our lawyer costs. 
And it is a really solvable problem because our goal is to get 
the customer to--to give them a product they want and to earn 
their trust.
    Senator Moran. Mr. Reed, thank you. Thank you, Chairman.
    The Chairwoman. Thank you. Thank you so much. Senator 
Markey, I don't know if you are ready to go now, but I want to 
thank you for your indulgence there with our colleagues and 
also thank you for your leadership on COPPA and your work back 
there, getting your staff more up to speed on what you are 
going to do--as opposed to the other way around.
    [Laughter.]

               STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD MARKEY, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS

    Senator Markey. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair, very 
much. Thanks to our expert panel. Yes, we are in a crisis. 
Children are being targeted as we sit here right now by 
hundreds of companies that just don't care about kids, don't 
care about their privacy. And that should be the one thing we 
all agree upon, that children should not be allowed to be 
preyed upon. Here are the numbers. It is frightening. 
Children's time on their devices has doubled over the last 
year, doubled over the last year.
    A study of kids Internet use found 144 percent increase in 
the number of messages children sent and received online in 
2020 versus 2019--one year. Today, 70 percent of parents 
estimate that their children spend at least 4 hours with 
screens every single day. So to each of you, please, yes or no.
    If we can't pass a bill which protects adults' privacy, 
should we ensure that we pass a bill that protects children's 
privacy in this Congress? Yes or no, Mr. Vladeck?
    Mr. Vladeck. Yes.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Children's privacy is very important, and I 
often point to COPPA as a very positive----
    Senator Markey. Yes or no, should we increase the 
protection?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Well, I haven't seen the bill, so I don't 
know.
    Senator Scott. I am not asking you for a bill. Should we 
protect children? If we can't protect adults, should we at 
least get children done in this Congress?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes.
    Senator Markey. OK. Yes. Thank you. Mr. Reed?
    Mr. Reed. Sure.
    Senator Markey. OK, good. Thank you. And----
    Mr. Soltani. Yes.
    Senator Markey.--Mr. Soltani. OK, thank you so much. Now 
the reality is--thank you, Mr. Vladeck. Going back to 1998, 
1999. Yes, I put to limit it to children under 13, but that 
wasn't my goal. It was to have it under 16 but the industry 
said no back then. You didn't have to be a genius to figure out 
a business model to exploit children, because historically 
industries had done it on television with television 
advertising, which is why we need children television 
advertising. So, you know, I was just blocked back in 1998, 
1999 from raising it up to 16. So it is not a new issue.
    It is like all of a sudden, oh my god, who would have ever 
thought that people would exploit children with technology that 
have been going on, you know, for many, many decades up to that 
point. And that is why Senator Cassidy and I have introduced 
Children and Teens Online Privacy Protection Act to increase 
the protections up to age 16. Mr. Soltani, can you briefly 
discuss the importance of banning targeted ads to children?
    Mr. Soltani. Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. So I 
think there is a key issue that COPPA doesn't really solve for 
data abuses once the consent has been given. And ads that are 
inherently manipulative, kids have a harder time detecting or 
knowing particularly when they are hyper targeted and 
personalized, using their kid's name or age or using their 
friend's likeness.
    More importantly, the harms of collection for kids are also 
higher. Kids have a limited ability to detect misuse or abuse 
of their data, identity theft, et cetera. So absolutely, I 
think considering a ban on OBA and targeting for kids is 
incredibly important. I think it would essentially deal with 
not just the privacy issues, but some of the other addiction 
and manipulation issues, dark patterns, etcetera, the kids are 
much more susceptible to.
    Senator Markey. Yes, and--thank you, Mr. Soltani. And that 
kind of targeting is banned in the bill, which Senator Cassidy 
and I have introduced. And again, I just think we have to put 
these laws on the books. And Mr. Vladeck, in terms of the with 
what the UK has done in implementing its age appropriate design 
code, a law to protect young people online--we are behind the 
UK right now. So can you talk a little bit about how what the 
UK is doing anticipates what we should do in the United States 
to upgrade the protections for children?
    Mr. Vladeck. I am sorry, I am not up to date on what the UK 
is doing.
    Senator Markey. You are not? Mr. Soltani, are you up to 
speed on that?
    Mr. Soltani. I am not an expert on it. I do agree that the 
code requires that app developers and software developers 
maintain certain standards. And I do agree that this Congress 
should absolutely consider or provide the FTC rulemaking 
authority to provide some of those.
    Senator Markey. And the reason I mentions it, Mr. Vladeck, 
is that you mentioned constructive knowledge in your statement, 
and that is pretty much what the UK has done in terms of the 
protection offered to children.
    Mr. Vladeck. Right, and from enforcement standpoint, that 
is the key question.
    Senator Markey. Thank you--that we need to protect. We need 
to assume constructive knowledge in terms of the activities.
    Mr. Vladeck. Yes, that is correct. That is the key change 
in the statute.
    Senator Markey. Yes, thank you. And again, we need to 
change the law so that if we are successful in putting the 
funding in to the Federal Trade Commission, that they have a 
law under which they can act in order to say to companies that 
are exploiting children, no, we are coming after you. And so it 
is all tied together. And if we put in the money for a privacy 
bureau at the Federal Trade Commission, but we don't change the 
law, so the kids are protected, then we really haven't finished 
the job. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    The Chairwoman. Thank you. Senator Thune, I believe, is 
joining us remotely.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA

    Senator Thune. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thanks for 
today's hearing. I believe that enacting comprehensive privacy 
legislation should be a top priority of this committee. And 
since we began privacy conversations in the aftermath of the 
Cambridge Analytica scandal, when I was--served as Chairman of 
the Committee, I have stated that there is no question we need 
a Federal law to protect consumers privacy. And I do not 
believe we should relinquish all responsibility by simply 
increasing our Federal bureaucracy, by putting a significant 
amount of funding at the FTC, I should say. So it is my hope 
that we can work together in a bipartisan fashion to establish 
uniform national policy. I push for more transparency about the 
algorithms used by big tech companies to analyze consumer data 
and make predictions intended to influence consumer behavior.
    Many consumers are unaware that much of the content that 
they see on the Internet platforms is determined by 
sophisticated algorithms that draw on data about each 
consumer's online activity. Billions of people are being fed 
content on Internet platforms as basically selected for them by 
opaque algorithms designed to keep consumers engaged on the 
platform. The powerful artificial intelligence behind these 
platforms creates a unique universe of information for each 
user, phenomenon that is often referred to as the filter 
bubble.
    Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal revealed that 
Facebook altered its opaque algorithm after seeing a decline in 
user engagement. They change in the algorithm that was intended 
to optimize user engagement resulted in more divisive, 
manipulative content being pushed to users. This troubling 
report is exactly why I introduced the Filter Bubble 
Transparency Act, and I am proud to have strong bipartisan 
support for this bill with Senators Blumenthal, Blackburn, 
Moran, Schatz, Warner, Collins, and Klobuchar as co-sponsors.
    Our legislation would give consumers more transparency 
about how algorithms are used to select content that they see 
online. And it would give consumers the option to engage with 
Internet platforms without being manipulated by opaque 
algorithms. So very quickly, I don't have a lot of time left, a 
couple of questions here. This is for each of you. Are Internet 
platforms doing enough to provide users with the transparency 
they deserve to make informed decisions about how they interact 
with the platform's services, yes or no?
    The Chairwoman. Who wants to start----
    Mr. Reed. Well, I will start and say no, but part of the 
problem is we are taking it from a compliance perspective. 
Merely adding another page to a terms of service or a click 
through doesn't actually achieve knowledge and doesn't actually 
allow the user to understand what is going on. So we have got 
to find a way to solve the problem that just doesn't add 
another page to a compliance document.
    Senator Thune. OK. Yes or no, other members of the panel.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. So I agree that legislation could be very 
beneficial to provide additional transparency to consumers.
    Mr. Vladeck. There is really no transparency to consumers. 
So, yes, we do need legislation to enable consumers to have a 
better sense of how decisions are being made.
    Mr. Soltani. Senator, no, I don't think enough is being 
done, and often the companies don't themselves know how their 
systems work, and that is why it is important not just to have 
transparency by the companies, but also have resources at the 
Federal Trade Commission that can verify those claims and those 
representations.
    Right now, to my knowledge, while the FTC has great staff 
and great technologists, there is not a single AI or 
algorithmic transparency expert at the Commission that can 
verify the claims that companies make. So to your question of 
big--Government, I do think it is important that they have 
expertise and resources to support the great legislation you 
are proposing.
    Senator Thune. And very quickly, do you agree that 
consumers ought to have the ability to use Internet platforms 
like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube without being manipulated 
by algorithms designed to keep them engaged on the platforms?
    Mr. Soltani. Is that to me?
    Senator Thune. Anybody. Just yes or no? Yes, I mean, it is 
a pretty straightforward question.
    Mr. Soltani. So I will jump in. So I--Go ahead, David.
    Mr. Vladeck. No, you go ahead, Ashkan. Sorry.
    Mr. Soltani. Sorry. I do think that having the ability to 
at least understand how the system works and there is you know, 
there is algorithmic targeting based on general machine 
learning of the population and based on your personal data. I 
think the latter, or I'm sorry, the former will be harder to 
limit but you can provide transparency to it. The latter, 
targeting and manipulation based on information about you, I 
think clearly you should have the ability to disable that hyper 
personalization and filter bubble activity.
    Senator Thune. Alright. Very quickly, do you all believe 
that we ought to need--that we need a national standard that 
says the same rules across the entire United States to ensure 
consumer protection?
    Mr. Reed. Yes, we need Federal preemptive privacy bill.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes, I agree,
    Mr. Vladeck. I too, I agree as well.
    Mr. Soltani. I don't think the standard needs to 
essentially preempt the states, but allow experimentation in 
the states, particularly because there is a bunch of different 
approaches and issues here. So as long as the standard can 
allow states to go further, then, sure.
    Senator Thune. Thank you all. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    The Chairwoman. Thank you. Senator Hickenlooper.

             STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN HICKENLOOPER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO

    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes, thank you. And thank you all for 
putting in the time and your public service. Really is 
illuminating. I am a former small business owner, as has been 
discussed already. I think regulations had to be carefully 
tailored to ensure fairness in regulation, but also appropriate 
oversight.
    I think you are all aware of the Colorado Privacy Act, 
applies to businesses with at least 100,000 data records or a 
business with 25,000 data records held and deriving some 
revenue from sale of data. It is different than other State 
laws in terms of applying revenue--other laws applying revenue 
threshold as a percentage. So Mr. Vladeck, would applying a 
privacy law to any business earning any revenue from the sale 
of personal data, does that efficiently promote broad 
compliance to require consumer protections? And why or why not?
    Mr. Vladeck. Well, there may be some constitutional issues 
with Congress under the Commerce Clause regulating really small 
businesses. But, you know, my own view is that at some point, 
State laws are going to fall, and not because of Congress 
necessarily, but because of the dormant Commerce Clause. And, 
you know, you are going to get a collision of State laws, which 
is why at some point Congress is going to need to pass a 
comprehensive privacy statute.
    But, you know, I worry that carve outs for small businesses 
without some subtlety to it would allow companies that can be 
incredibly disruptive on the Internet, tiny companies to evade 
regulation. When--during my tenure as Bureau Chief at the FTC 
of Bureau of Consumer Protection, we went after some small 
companies that created massive harm. So----
    Senator Hickenlooper. Can you give me an example?
    Mr. Vladeck. Sure. So Frost Wire was about to send out an 
app, a file sharing app with a default that would--hard to 
disable, that would have required--that would have permitted or 
encourage file sharing. Designer Wear designed an app that 
allowed remote activation of a computer's camera, you know, and 
so--you know, and that is--you know, that app was installed in 
millions of computers that were then rented and then sold to 
consumers and the clerks, you know, in the rental office did 
often just simply turn on the computer and see what was going 
on in your house.
    So, you know, there are small companies that can cause 
enormous harm. And so I am sympathetic to the need to promote 
an innovation with small incubators that need to be protected. 
But there also has to be a balance because some of the small 
companies have caused great harm.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Those are sufficiently gruesome that 
I am almost sorry I asked.
    Mr. Soltani. And Senator, if I may--it I may jump in. 
Additionally, it is no longer the small developer in their 
bedroom. Oftentimes these are VC supported or, you know, angel 
supported companies. When I was at the FTC, we did kind of a 
road show where we met and interviewed a number of VCs in the 
investment community. And often they do not absolutely invest 
in security or privacy from the start. They don't look--it is 
actually what they consider a waste of money. And as Professor 
Vladeck mentioned, oftentimes small companies can have a real 
significant harm to consumers and completely obliterate their 
requirement to do any investment in security or privacy and 
cause great harm.
    So I think it is--it needs a bit of nuance, as you consider 
that carve out.
    Senator Hickenlooper. No, absolutely. I appreciate that. 
Mr. Reed, again, the Colorado Privacy Act was passed in July of 
2021 and again allows a narrow and temporary right to cure on 
private deficiencies. But this right of cure defaults after 2 
years. And I know we have discussed about this a little bit, 
but I thought more specifically though, how could a narrow and 
temporary cure period help small businesses, let's say, well 
intentioned small businesses and startups to adapt to new 
regulations for privacy?
    Mr. Reed. Right. And as you know, we actively supported 
passage of the Colorado bill and we are hopeful that it and 
some like it serve as a model that we can move forward on. So 
you asked for how does it--how does it work, right. So, again, 
for a legitimate business that isn't trying to manipulate or 
spy on people through rental computers, all of those things are 
exactly the kind of harm that the FTC should be going after.
    If you are a legitimate business that is trying to acquire 
customers or deal with people, then the right to cure allows 
you to fix something that either, a, you didn't communicate 
clearly through your terms of service or, b, that didn't match 
the expectations of customers. And so the period of cure is 
really critical because if you failed in one of those two 
things, your primary job is to solve it because you want to 
stay in business.
    So absolutely, that is how we see a narrow period of cure 
working. And again, that doesn't prohibit the ability of the 
FTC or State AGs to go after truly bad actors like the one that 
Professor Vladeck raised earlier.
    Senator Hickenlooper. And thank you very much, Madam Chair. 
Thank you.
    The Chairwoman. Thank you. Senator Lummis.

               STATEMENT OF HON. CYNTHIA LUMMIS, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING

    Senator Lummis. Thank you, Madam Chairman. We all know that 
large technology platforms have been given unfettered access to 
collect data on the most sensitive areas of our lives, often 
without our knowledge or consent. This data is then repackaged 
and sold to the highest bidder or used to fuel algorithms that 
target us with overly invasive advertising.
    So I applaud the Committee. I applaud you, Madam Chairman. 
It is long past time that Congress shine a light on these 
unsupervised practices. I am concerned, however, that despite 
our best efforts, Congress may be outmaneuvered by these tech 
platforms. It is like a magician who uses misdirection to 
distract his audience. These companies have already used 
practices that bypass the guardrails that Congress intends to 
put up, and more are on the way.
    I had an Op-ed published yesterday that underlined some of 
these activities, and I ask that it be included in the record.
    The Chairwoman. Without objection.

        The bipartisan reason Congress should regulate big tech

BY SEN. CYNTHIA LUMMIS (R-WYO,), OPINION CONTRIBUTOR--09/27/21 7:00 PM 
                                   ET

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    In Wyoming, privacy is a way of life. We are the smallest state by 
population, but among the largest in physical size. Privacy is baked 
into our lifestyles since many in the Cowboy State live miles from 
their nearest neighbor.
    The Internet has aided our relatively isolated way of life. It has 
enabled us to more easily keep in touch with relatives, conduct 
business, and entertain ourselves. But it has not changed that very 
Wyoming desire for personal privacy.
    What concerns me, is that some of the companies serving as the 
chief enablers of our connected lifestyles and Internet access are 
undermining our privacy rights. And they are doing so in broad 
daylight, but going mostly undetected.
    Let's start with the latest example: Apple. Apple recently 
announced a welcomed delay to its program that would have begun 
scanning iPhones for images of child abuse. Now, let's start with the 
obvious: as a mother and grandmother, I abhor child abuse. But, 
Americans must take threats to their civil liberties seriously. In 
fact, reports claim that some of Apple's own employees were protesting 
against the adoption of this new policy, fearing that it could be 
exploited by bad actors. Thankfully, your voices were heard, but we 
must remain vigilant.
    It was only a few years ago that Apple fought the U.S. government 
tooth and nail when the FBI pressured them to unlock a terrorist's 
iPhone. Even by considering this proposal, it seems those days are long 
gone. And when the government pressures private companies to invade 
your privacy, every American should be concerned. The reason is simple: 
we oppose the creation of a surveillance state. Once built, who's left 
to stop this technology from being repurposed to surveil other intimate 
parts of our lives, or to monitor political speech, as they already do 
in China or Russia?
    And what about Facebook? For several years, Facebook has created 
``shadow profiles'' of non-Facebook users for its own ad services. The 
data it collects on each person allows Facebook to build a 
comprehensive profile of a person who is largely unaware that it is 
happening, and is unable to control it. This means if you've never had 
a Facebook profile, but your friends do, then Facebook uses information 
posted about you and compiles it into a ``shadow profile.'' Unlike 
users, you never gave Facebook any information about yourself. Frankly, 
Facebook doesn't care. This raises all kinds of red flags.
    Up next is Google's Federated Learning of Cohorts, or FLoC. FLoC is 
Google's replacement for third-party trackers. Rather than 
individualized ads based on your browsing history, Google uses FLoC to 
place users into an anonymous cohort with other users based on web 
searches and other behavior. This is troublesome because, for example, 
a user might be placed into a mental health related cohort for googling 
about substance abuse treatments. Additionally, this means that your 
browsing history is still being tracked. It is entirely possible that, 
despite Google's efforts, it will be easier for companies down the road 
to reverse engineer, or ``fingerprint,'' exactly who a user is based on 
these cohorts.
    Finally, Amazon. Amazon recently received approval from the FCC to 
use radar technology to monitor your sleep habits and ``motion in a 
three-dimensional space.'' This technology has not been implemented 
yet, but Amazon is clearly gearing up for deployment. Certain Amazon 
hardware like Alexa has already been shown to continuously ``listen'' 
to pretty much every conversation within its radius, but this 3-D 
monitoring is a realm of science fiction that we have never before 
realized. If we can't enjoy privacy in our own bedroom, then what is 
left?
    This is not a comprehensive list, just some of the most egregious 
examples from the largest tech companies. These are also not instances 
of political policing or preference. The right to privacy is a 
bipartisan issue.
    Such actions are incredibly alarming and sobering. However, 
ultimate blame belongs with Congress, for not taking action.
    As a freshman senator, I have been mostly sitting on the sidelines 
of the big tech debate, monitoring the issue and learning. 
Unfortunately, our tech companies are not quietly waiting for us to 
come up with confines for them. They are innovating and pushing 
boundaries because we have not set any.
    It's time to act, and I look forward to learning more at this 
week's Senate Commerce Committee hearings on protecting consumer 
privacy. In the privacy-loving Cowboy State, we know that fences make 
good neighbors. It's time Congress puts up some fences around big tech.
Senator Cynthia Lummis is the junior senator from Wyoming.

    Senator Lummis. We all must gain a better understanding 
about the types of data collection activities that the large 
platforms are utilizing. We must know who has our data? What 
types of data do they have? When are they collecting our 
information? Where is it being sold? And how is it being used? 
We can't hope to craft a strong bipartisan, consumer oriented 
framework for data privacy without that information.
    So I am hoping this hearing is moving us closer to enacting 
that framework. And now I have a question for any of the 
witnesses that feels you want to weigh in on this. So my first 
question is on specific data collection practices. I am 
concerned that these don't fall within the scope of the 
California CPA or the European Union's GDPR or the proposed 
bills here. An example is the Facebook pixel. The Facebook 
pixel is used by numerous websites to identify unregistered 
visitors to that site.
    Since the pixel loads with the webpage, consumers have no 
ability to opt in or opt out. This practice allows Facebook to 
determine that person's identity and record specific data about 
their web activity. This enables Facebook to collect data on 
nearly every consumer and target them with high precision 
advertising. Does this panel feel that this type of data 
collection would be covered under any of these laws?
    Mr. Soltani. I am happy to start.
    The Chairwoman. Yes, that is a good idea. Mr. Soltani.
    Mr. Soltani. So, I am quite aware of the kind of 
surreptitious tracking you describe and I won't speak about 
GDPR, but under CCPA and CPRA, the essentially third party 
tracking, where the transfer of data, for example, by the first 
party to Facebook would be constituted--would constitute a sale 
under the CCPA and the CPRA, and consumers are allowed to opt 
out of that transfer by indicating, for example, on The New 
York Times that they don't want their information sent or sold 
to Facebook.
    Importantly, the CCPA and CPRA also provide consumers 
rather than having to opt out on every website they click on, 
or they visit, they can set a setting in their browser called 
the Global Privacy Control, which essentially sends that signal 
and indicates their opt-out preferences to every website they 
visit.
    So, for example, if I have and today, if I go to The New 
York Times or The Washington Post using a browser that supports 
this protocol, I am automatically opted out of the sale of my 
personal information to those third parties and the California 
AG is able to enforce when that transfer does occur.
    Senator Lummis. So could that also apply to the example I 
used like this Facebook pixel, which loads with the webpage?
    Mr. Soltani. Exactly. So that is precisely the type of 
transfer it is intended to curb. Essentially, The New York 
Times is making available consumers data to Facebook as a sale. 
And so when you opt-out of a sale, you essentially have--The 
New York Times would restrict that data transfer to Facebook.
    There are some caveats with regards to whether Facebook 
would operate under the context of the service provider and 
therefore not use users' data for their own benefit, but only 
for, for example, measurement for the benefit of New York 
Times. And that is in the AG's rulemaking. But effectively, 
this surreptitious silent pixel based, third party pixel based 
tracking is intentionally one of the key aspects of the law.
    Senator Lummis. Are any of you aware of other data 
collection practices that similarly bypass, at least opt-in 
requirements of existing privacy laws?
    Mr. Soltani. Happy to jump in on that one. Go ahead.
    Mr. Reed. Yes, no, go ahead.
    Mr. Soltani. So, absolutely. So one of the biggest gaps, I 
think, in privacy law today, including with CCPA and CPRA, are 
a collection from websites that consumers don't interact with. 
So not just when I interact with The New York Times' best 
seller, share my data with Facebook, but really the myriad of 
data brokers that collect my information either from across the 
web, either from me to public records or private records, where 
they purchase it from companies that I have essentially--I am 
not aware of, or even when companies will, for example, capture 
data that appears in public records, as I said.
    And so that--curbing that behavior is incredibly difficult 
because consumers don't have a direct relationship with the 
third-party data brokers that are selling their information. 
And no framework really is able to curb that today. Consumers 
can today go under the California law and opt-out of each data 
broker, but they have to take some action or employ an 
authorized agent, a company, a service that will go and delete 
or opt-out their data for them, right. And this is a huge gap, 
right.
    So a good example is I don't know if you have Full Contact. 
They are an e-mail provider that, for example, in order to use 
a service for free, I give that provider access to all of my e-
mails, which includes the e-mails I have sent to you, Senator. 
And therefore, they are able to get your contact information, 
your phone number, all that information from those e-mails and 
then further sell or share that information. That is something 
we have a very difficult time really addressing today.
    Senator Lummis. Thank you for your response. I would love 
to--yes, sir.
    Mr. Reed. Just very quickly, there is one aspect of this 
that we keep coming back to. And part of it is you asked a 
question about consent to. Another former FTC alum, Professor 
Lorrie Cranor, who is also the CTO at the FTC. She has done 
significant research about, do people understand what they are 
consenting to in the first place?
    And so as we are talking about all of these consent 
mechanisms, the thing to really remember is what are we trying 
to achieve? What is the behavior change? What is the outcome we 
are trying to achieve? So when we asked the question about, did 
they did they consent? Did they know what they consented to?
    The Chairwoman. Thank you. Senator Peters. Although I 
think, Senator Lummis, you just made the point of why we need 
more technologists at the agency, because the only person who 
could answer the first question was Mr. Ashkan Soltani. So 
anyway, these things aren't mysterious. They aren't that 
mysterious. You just need people who understand the technology 
to basically help inform the lawyers and the other policymakers 
about some of the--thank you, though. Senator Peters.

                STATEMENT OF HON. GARY PETERS, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN

    Senator Peters. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you for 
this hearing. And I want to pick up on some of the answers to 
the questions by Senator Lummis and actually a bill that the 
two of us have introduced related to data brokers. And I had 
asked additional questions of Mr. Soltani. But when I think 
about data brokers and why we have introduced this bill as an 
example, in 2019, a data broker tried to sell the names, the 
addresses, the high schools, and the hobbies of 1.2 million 
children. And this was uncovered through a violation of 
Vermont's recently enacted law.
    And those State law--and through State law was discovered 
that another company called Amerilist was selling the name, 
home address, age, religion, education level, and income of 
5,000 people for $150. And so that is why Senator Lummis and I 
have joined together trying to seek more transparency in this. 
We have introduced the Data Broker List Act to ensure that data 
broker companies actually register with the FTC. The bill would 
require companies to provide the agency with the types of 
information the company has collected and an explanation for 
the purpose of why that data is collected.
    First question for you, Mr. Reed, in this. In your 
testimony, you noted that 89 percent of mobile devices have 
denied data features to apps they didn't trust, and over half 
of the users have deleted apps due to privacy concerns. So I am 
interested in hearing your suggestions on how we improve and 
expand the Vermont law that I have already mentioned had an 
impact in identifying abuse, as well as California data broker 
laws at the Federal level. Particularly how to ensure that data 
brokers are transparent with this information. What suggestions 
do you have for us?
    Mr. Reed. So first of all, I think that looking at both 
Colorado and Virginia's recently passed bills are also 
incredibly helpful on this. But one of the things to be aware 
of is something that Mr. Soltani mentioned. Right now in 
California you can go to the website, and you can see the list 
of data brokers. You can click to them. How many consumers 
actually go to the Government page and wallow through their 
poorly written HTML code to find the click link to go to figure 
out who their--what the data brokers are and what they have on 
them.
    So part of it is not merely finding a way for the data 
brokers to say, yes, you know, find me here. But to actually 
engage with the consumer at the point of which their data is 
collected and make sure that the party who is collecting that 
information is responsible or at least is communicating 
clearly, and I don't mean page 37 of a terms of service, about 
what they are doing, who they are providing it to.
    Because you are talking about the data brokers, but the 
data brokers have to get that data from somewhere. And that is 
the point of inflection in which the consumer has the most 
impact. So while I think it is good to have a list of data 
brokers and I think it is good to have transparency, let's 
start at the point of impact. And that means my members, they 
have to communicate clearly to user. Here is what I want. Here 
is what I am going to do with it.
    Here is what I am not going to do with it. And I think you 
will enjoy my product. And if they can't say that, then they 
shouldn't be on a platform.
    Senator Peters. Some smaller data brokers have suggested 
that they should be completely exempt from reporting and 
disclosure requirements. They are a small business and that----
    Mr. Reed. Absolutely not.
    Senator Peters. You have already--the question is, should 
Congress consider FTC exemptions for data brokers? Should we 
treat them like we do your average small business down the 
street?
    Mr. Reed. No, because they aren't the small business down 
the street and they are not the point of inflection, right. 
They are not the point at which you, the consumer, engaged with 
the activity that provided your data. So they are opaque to 
most users. And so, no, I don't think that they should be 
exempt completely because they are no different than the local 
small business or the bike store.
    Senator Peters. Absolutely. And one final question, Mr. 
Reed. I am a founding member of the Senate's Artificial 
Intelligence Caucus, and I would like to hear from you about 
how companies are using AI to preserve privacy. And where do 
you see some challenges and what role do you think the FTC 
should play in ensuring that we are dealing with some of the 
challenges of AI while not discouraging innovation?
    Mr. Reed. Well, I have to put a plug in for our white paper 
on good machine learning practices, which we have developed. 
But you are asking a really important question. AI can help to 
preserve privacy. It can do so by making sure that you strip 
out data that is personally identifiable before you actually do 
the learning. The place that has created the most, and I am 
looking at time, the most difficulty in understanding how we 
move forward is in health care.
    I am honored to serve on Federal Advisory Committee for HHS 
on some issues around education and outreach. One of the 
biggest problems in the AI space is, I don't need to know if 
you like blue interiors on cars, right? I don't need to know 
that Senator Peters likes blue interiors. I just need to know 
that a large group of people like blue interiors and so I make 
a marketing decision. Now, if I need to know what medication 
works best for a group of people with several comorbidities, 
then I need detailed information. And that means I need your 
private information, your most private information to know what 
medication works, what treatment regime work best, what are the 
things that I should warn you about in advance. Digital 
retinopathy.
    There is so many places where knowing more about you allows 
me to keep you healthy and safety earlier in the process 
through the physician. So when it comes to AI, the questions 
that are to ask, is it necessary to have that extra data to 
provide some very specific value, especially in health care, to 
the customer--to the person--I keep talking customers. They are 
people--to the people.
    If it is something where I just need to know, hey, you like 
blue interiors and 10,000 other people like blue interiors. Oh, 
but they also like silver trim. Great. I need to remove the 
identifiable information on you when I am training that engine 
to develop what I am going to do for my marketing material. So 
I think there is this split. Sometimes we need it to provide a 
need and a good, sometimes we don't.
    And in that way AI can actually be useful to strip out the 
parts that we should be--we should be leaving on the sidelines.
    Senator Peters. Right. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    The Chairwoman. Thank you. Senator Lee.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE LEE, 
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM UTAH

    Senator Lee. Thank you, Madam Chair. And Ms. Ohlhausen, I 
would like to start with you, if that is all right. Earlier 
this year, the FTC took some steps to remove some rulemaking 
barriers to their authority under Section 18 of the Federal 
Trade Commission Act. They wanted to make it easier for the 
Commission to engage in rulemaking.
    Now, these procedural requirements that they are trying to 
get around were put in place in the 1970s after the Federal 
Trade Commission had gone on something of a rulemaking binge. 
So Congress put in place restrictions on that power so they 
would be less inclined to do it again. So I find it a little 
bit surprising, shocking, in fact, to see these rather blatant, 
bold efforts by the Commission to seize rulemaking power 
against manifested Congressional opposition and statutory 
impediments put in place designed to discourage that.
    Now, I am skeptical that Congress should even grant the 
Federal Trade Commission broad rulemaking power, APA universe 
style rulemaking power, to the Federal Trade Commission. But 
setting that aside, should Congress even consider granting this 
rulemaking power with the current trajectory being undertaken 
by the Federal Trade Commission to flaunt, rather cavalierly 
disregard restrictions on the rulemaking power that it is 
already in place?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. So, Senator, you know, the FTC definitely 
has a checkered history with rulemaking, and that is why the 
Magnuson-Moss Act and the Federal Trade Commission Improvement 
Act got enacted by Congress to put particular guardrails in 
place. So the more clarity Congress can give to what it wants 
the FTC to do, I think that comes--you know, that works much 
better.
    So when you think about the Children's Online Privacy 
Protection Act where Congress set the boundaries, Congress set 
the age limit, and then gave the FTC the authority to update 
what is personal information based on how technology changed, I 
think that was a really good model.
    Senator Lee. Yes. No, clarity certainly helps. And I am 
sure you can understand my frustration and my reluctance to 
give them anything in light of the fact that they haven't 
complied with existing restrictions and seem to be looking for 
ways to get around them. Now, as we consider what else we might 
do with the FTC and as we take into account the rulemaking 
abuse over the decades, I want to analyze that against the 
current backdrop of the proposal to create a new FTC privacy 
bureau.
    My understanding is that the FTC's Fiscal Year 2022 budget 
request amounted to $389 million. The House's reconciliation 
bill, the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill proposes including 
an additional billion dollars on top of that to give to the 
FTC. And the intended purpose for that is, and I am going to 
read the entirety of the legislative text that deals with this 
issue. Here it is. It is to, ``create and operate a bureau, 
including by hiring and retaining technologists, user 
experience designers, and other experts, as the Commission 
considers appropriate to accomplish the work of the Commission 
related to unfair or deceptive acts or practices related--
relating to privacy, data security, identity theft, data 
abuses, and related matters.''
    So, Commissioner Ohlhausen, setting aside for a minute 
whether we have $1 billion to spend on this right now, which I 
don't believe we do, but setting aside that issue for a moment, 
how would this--what kind of conflict might this create within 
the FTC? Conflict, for example, with the Bureau of Consumer 
Protection. And how is that language--you referred a moment ago 
to the need to give them clear directives. How does this 
comport with that or does it?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. So I think it is important to pair both 
additional resources and additional statutory guidance and 
clarity to the FTC for its privacy enforcement. We have talked 
a lot about privacy. I think that, you know, is a useful thing. 
But the FTC does a lot of other important enforcement in areas, 
you know, as varied as unsafe products, you know, deceptive 
advertising, credit issues. I mean, the list kind of goes on 
and on. So I do think that, you know, we don't want to sort of 
disregard the other important things that the FTC does. But I 
think those--the resources and the statutory clarity need to be 
paired.
    Senator Lee. OK, I see my time has expired and so I am 
going to move on. I wanted to ask you a little bit more detail 
about the nature of the data privacy harm but i will do that in 
writing. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    The Chairwoman. Senator Rosen is next.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JACKY ROSEN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Rosen. Thank you, Chair Cantwell and, of course, 
Ranking Member Wicker for holding the hearing today, it is so 
important. I want to thank all the witnesses. The testimony has 
been very good. I appreciate everything that you are working 
on. And I want to talk a little bit about health data privacy, 
because I am a member of both this Commerce committee and the 
Health committee. And so I have an opportunity to see up close 
the intersection between technology and health care. Wearable 
technology has been at the forefront of the Internet of Things, 
and it offers greater insights into our health every day, how 
we can improve it, monitor it, et cetera, et cetera.
    You know, last year alone, there were more than 90,000 
health apps that were released, including apps for fertility, 
medication, even to sleep better. So despite these exciting 
developments, I am concerned with the ability of companies to 
use that data that they have accumulated from the health apps 
and the wearables to draw inferences about individuals and 
groups.
    And so these assumptions are that we as individuals may not 
have the opportunity to verify, but they can nonetheless 
significantly impact our lives, sometimes even leading to 
profiling or discrimination. That is why Senator Cassidy, and I 
reintroduced the bipartisan Smartwatch Act, which extends 
existing health care privacy protections under HIPPA to 
personal health data collected by apps and by wearables, 
preventing this data from being sold or used commercially 
without the consumer's consent.
    So Ms. Ohlhausen, can you discuss some of the challenges 
with protecting consumer health data that we are seeing and 
some of the examples of best practices for protecting this data 
that might not currently--might not currently be under HIPPA? 
Where do we need to expand?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes, Senator. It is--it became apparent as 
health apps and other online sort of uses for health data were 
not covered by HIPPA, so they didn't necessarily have those 
HIPPA-like protections in place.
    So I think the FTC has actually been fairly vigilant about 
making sure that the collection and use and sharing of 
sensitive personal data, which health data would be considered 
that, is done with the knowledge and consent of consumers, and 
that it is not done in a way that harms consumers. And 
certainly discrimination would be, you know, one of the 
prohibited harms for that. So I think that the FTC has been 
active in that space, and I hope it will continue to be.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. I appreciate that. But you know, 
we need to address some of the challenges. The Federal Trade 
Commission has issued a policy statement affirming that health 
apps and connected devices that collect or use consumers' 
health information must comply with the health breach 
notification rule. This rule requires that apps and devices 
notify consumers when their information is breached.
    So, Mr. Soltani, do you believe the FTC's policy statement 
goes far enough to protect consumers' health data? And if not, 
what recommendations might you have for us here in the Senate 
regarding these policies to strengthen the protection of 
consumer health data?
    Mr. Soltani. That is a great question. Thank you. 
Absolutely, I think we would need to expand those definitions 
to not only include the kind of narrow definitions of health 
data, but also some of the related health related data and that 
my co-panelists mentioned, particularly when thinking about 
things like AI and inferences and machine learning, where 
oftentimes the data is inferences that the consumer didn't 
necessarily provide, but that were made by the software system 
about the consumer.
    And so we want to make sure that the agency has adequate 
ability to identify those problems and also create rules and 
standards for safeguarding that information.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. I want to quickly kind of add on 
to that because we have very vulnerable populations, 
particularly our visually impaired and our hearing impaired 
populations. So these technology advancements, they really can 
help people locate in places and mobility impairment. We have 
all kinds of things in that space. And so these kinds of 
populations are vulnerable populations that really rely on this 
adaptive technology to--for their day to day lives.
    So this technology is not a choice where it might be for 
some other app. So, again, Mr. Soltani, how do you think we can 
add to our privacy laws to protect our medically vulnerable or 
vulnerable populations, such as a hearing impaired, mobility 
impaired, or visually impaired?
    Mr. Soltani. Absolutely. I think those considerations, 
again, have to be made. When you think about, it is not just 
vulnerable populations, although I think they are incredibly 
important, but even today, due to COVID and due to the way we 
are living our lives, we are forced to use and adopt 
technologies because our doctors will push them on us, right.
    And so we need to essentially make sure that those 
realities of the fact that we don't often have choice and are 
required to provide consent, even though we may not want to, 
creates a lot of problems with regards to the data collection 
and use. So the ability to, for example, opt-out of any 
secondary use, restrict the data to be--or require the data to 
be deleted after was immediately used and require companies to 
store it securely for the time they do have it, I think are 
going to be critical both to any future legislation, but also 
guidance to the FTC.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. I think those are--excuse me, 
some great suggestions. And I look forward to us being able to 
work with you to find ways to implement those. Thank you, Madam 
Chair.
    The Chairwoman. Which one of you showed--Senator Lujan, 
Senator Warnock, which one of you--I thought--anyways, 
whichever one of you is next. Senator Warnock, thank you.

              STATEMENT OF HON. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM GEORGIA

    Senator Warnock. Thank you so very much, Madam Chair. 
Privacy violations affect all of us and so we are grateful for 
this hearing. While all of us are affected by privacy 
violations, those harms can fall unequally across communities. 
We have seen historically how marginalized communities or 
historically marginalized communities particularly suffer from 
tech companies' unchecked data collection and use.
    In 2019, HUD actually sued Facebook for housing 
discrimination, because its algorithms targeted housing ads 
based on sensitive information, such as where people lived, 
whether they were a mom, if they were--or their religion. We 
have also heard reports of how platforms allow businesses to 
discriminate on who actually sees certain job advertisements so 
that the technology is re-inscribing in new ways old problems 
of discrimination and marginalization.
    Showing ads to young men and not to women or older 
Americans. Professor Vladeck, how can the FTC use its 
investigation and enforcement powers to hold tech companies 
accountable when they enable and further deepen patterns of 
discrimination?
    Mr. Vladeck. That is a great question and I think your 
description of the problem is spot on. The FTC has the 
authority to push and to force companies to not engage in 
biased activity online. And that--you know, those problems 
would be sort of under the unfairness jurisdiction of the FTC. 
And the FTC has done some, but probably not enough work in that 
space. And, you know, my bottom line is, give the FTC more 
resources and give the FTC a nudge in that direction and it 
will do its job. But again, the FTC has never had more than a 
few technologists on staff.
    In order to sort of surveil the advertising practices, 
because that is really where the problem stems from, the FTC 
would need more resources. We need people online doing the kind 
of day to day oversight or surveillance that if the FTC were 
better resourced, the FTC could do.
    Senator Warnock. I agree that the FTC needs the resources 
in order to provide this kind of enforcement, which is why 20 
civil rights organizations sent a letter last month asking the 
FTC to create an Office of Civil Rights. Mr. Soltani, what 
types of structural changes do you think would help the 
Commission to build expertise and capacity to protect consumer 
rights in general and marginalized communities in particular?
    Mr. Soltani. Senator, thank you for the question. 
Absolutely. I think the effect of these new technology systems 
on already marginalized communities is immense. Most of the 
kind of machine learning and AI simply, you know, is machine 
learning based on what we have historically done in the past. 
So often they fundamentally re-enforce existing inequities 
since they just learn from past behavior.
    So absolutely, either creating an Office of Civil Rights, 
an OCR, that works across the agency or as I have suggested, 
perhaps including that function, making sure that the new 
bureau that gets created with this funding also has experts and 
expertise that work across the agency's mission on these issues 
of discrimination, algorithmic fairness, and bias, I think are 
incredibly important. Additionally structural changes, to go to 
the previous Senator's comment, I think rulemaking here, or at 
least the authority to create rules, the rules of the road are 
incredibly important.
    So I personally have done a lot of this work. I have done 
worked with The Wall Street Journal showing that, you know, 
companies will charge different prices to consumers based on 
where they live, how far they are from a competitor's store, 
particularly in disadvantaged communities and an area codes. So 
it is very difficult and hard stuff to do from the outside.
    So additional resources would help, but so would 
essentially guidance to companies that they need to self-test 
and self-attest, self-verify that their systems do not bias 
against consumers on areas like, you know, race, gender, age 
for protected categories like housing, credit, employment, 
right. And I think companies are in the best position to do 
this and can provide those attestations to the FTC.
    And if the FTC has qualified staff to then review and 
verify, that would help really move the ball forward, I think.
    The Chairwoman. And just to clarify on that, Ashkan, to the 
earlier question about transparency and Senator Thune?s' 
question to the panel, if you had algorithm transparency, you 
would then determine whether that algorithm did have bias in 
it, so.
    Mr. Soltani. To some degree. Oftentimes, as I said, with 
machine learning, most of the creators of the system---like in 
the HUD example, right. So it wasn't that the advertisers 
themselves or even Facebook intentionally was guiding the 
algorithm to have disparate impact on who was served certain 
advertising to who HUD made offers to. It's that the systems to 
learn.
    And so that is kind of difficult to provide just from 
transparency alone, because it consists of both the algorithms 
and the underlying data, which is often not available for 
privacy reasons. So what you would rather do is, in addition to 
transparency, you want to provide testing and accreditation 
that the bias doesn't exist on these protected categories.
    Senator Warnock. Thank you so much. I think with data 
collection and algorithms and the technology, there is this 
this sort of perception of objectivity and what we are seeing 
is a ways in which it further creates increased 
marginalization, and we have to be vigilant in order to protect 
that.
    The Chairwoman. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Warnock. 
Senator Lujan.

               STATEMENT OF HON. BEN RAY LUJAN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO

    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Chair. I want to thank you and 
our ranking member for holding the hearing to discuss critical 
issues involving consumer privacy. As we know today, companies 
and platforms collect an unprecedented amount of data. And I 
believe that this committee and Congress should act to protect 
consumers' data from bad actors. The Commerce Committee has a 
clear responsibility to ensure that consumers' personal data is 
only used when the informed consent of consumers is given. 
Congress must give the FTC sufficient resources to do its job. 
I support additional funding for the FTC to establish a new 
privacy bureau.
    The Chair fought for such a bureau in the Consumer Online 
Privacy Rights Act, and I am encouraged to see this critical 
initiative moving forward. Now, companies have failed to 
adequately protect data and user privacy. Bad actors have 
gained access to my constituents' health records, financial 
information, and Social Security numbers. They have used this 
data to threaten families' livelihoods, and it has impacted 
hundreds of thousands of people in New Mexico and millions 
across America.
    This is a real problem, and the problem is only getting 
worse with every data breach that we learn about. Mr. Soltani, 
yes or no. Today, does the FTC have the technical expertise to 
fully protect consumer privacy?
    Mr. Soltani. Unfortunately, no, Senator.
    Senator Lujan. Mr. Soltani, yes or no. Would hiring more 
technologists at the FTC help protect families from data 
breaches and bad actors?
    Mr. Soltani. Absolutely, yes. Particularly if you consider 
technologists broadly, not just folks like myself.
    Senator Lujan. And Mr. Soltani, you have advocated 
repeatedly for Congress to invest more resources for 
technologists at the FTC, so thank you for the work you have 
done on this topic. In your testimony, you highlighted the 
importance of having technologists who are empowered to serve 
the entire agency, and I share your view. That is why I am 
introducing a bill, the Federal Trade Commission Technologist 
Act, will establish an office of technologists within the FTC 
that can work across the Commission to solve these problems.
    An office like this would give the privacy bureau the Chair 
has put forth the tools it needs. It would also provide 
critical technological expertise in areas like antitrust and 
competition. Mr. Soltani, do you support my goal of making 
technologists available across the Commission?
    Mr. Soltani. Absolutely. I think that is exactly the right 
move.
    Senator Lujan. And there are a few other questions I have 
in that space. I will submit them to the record. The current 
State of Federal privacy law is a patchwork of requirements 
varying from industry to industry with many holes. Many of my 
colleagues today have raised the concerns where HIPPA is a 
clear example that Federal law was a game changer. HIPPA is a 
household term now. The legislation and its protection of 
health information has become fundamental.
    For example, if I go to my doctor to get an echocardiogram 
or genomic testing, the health information they collect from me 
and my body is protected by HIPPA, but collect the same 
information from the same place, but with an Apple watch, 
health app, or consumer biotech, and it is the Wild West. It 
makes zero sense to me. This month, the FTC announced that they 
will be increasing enforcement for applications that collect 
personal health information. But an FTC--but as the FTC Chair 
noted, this action reflects a more fundamental problem, the 
commodification of sensitive health information.
    As we embark on the task of creating more comprehensive 
privacy requirements for technology companies, are there any 
lessons learned from HIPPA and how to effectively protect 
health data? And I would ask any of the witnesses to come 
forward.
    Mr. Reed. Yes, I think--I think one of the things, Senator, 
that is interesting is, I doubt we have had a more poorly 
understood law than HIPPA or rather the privacy rule of it. And 
it actually gets to the core thing that all of the witnesses 
have been asking for here today, and that is a Federal privacy 
legislation. As you know, when HIPPA was passed, the privacy 
rule was actually done years later, and it was not done by 
Congress.
    And part of the problem is, it is hampered by the fact, and 
this is why we need Federal privacy legislation---it is 
hampered by the fact that it is actually triggered by the 
filing of an electronic insurance claim tied to record 
portability. And the reason it cannot cover the other material 
that you asked is because the statute that gave HIPPA its 
origin story is very closely tied to portability of data.
    So a Federal privacy law that actually starts from the 
premise of we need to protect privacy is the place to start 
rather than starting from data portability, oh, yes, let's add 
privacy to it. So it is really the origin story of HIPPA that 
causes so much of the confusion. And now that is why we are all 
here today to say, let's have Federal privacy legislation that 
starts from a discussion of privacy rather than tail on the 
dog.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that. Well, I am about out of 
time, so if we could ask you to submit that into the record. I 
am also going to be submitting a question to the record with my 
concerns about what the chair pointed out with commodification 
of sensitive health information. I am very interested in your 
response there. Last, Chair Cantwell, in the space that was 
raised a few times by my colleague from Wyoming, Ms. Lummis, 
specific about Facebook and collecting user information on 
people that have never agreed to terms of service.
    Will also be submitting a follow up to a round of 
questioning I had with Mr. Zuckerberg when I was a member of 
the House around how the FTC and Congress can protect the 
privacy of our constituents who have never signed up for an 
account or assigned terms of service agreements. Very much 
appreciate this hearing and look forward to following up.
    The Chairwoman. Thank you and thank you for crystallizing 
the issue about technologists with the legislation. That will 
be very helpful. Thank you. Senator Blumenthal.

             STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT

    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you, Senator Cantwell, and thank 
you for having this hearing. There are now some pretty good 
indications that the Federal Trade Commission is going to have 
or begin rulemaking on privacy. This development would be very, 
very welcome. Last week, I wrote to Chair Khan, along with 
Senators Klobuchar, Markey, and Schatz, and Lujan, and four 
other colleagues urging the FTC to start rulemaking concerning 
privacy. A coalition of 24 major national civil rights groups, 
privacy advocates, and consumer groups have joined in the call 
for that action.
    The reason is very simply that Congress has failed to act, 
in fact, failed abjectly to fulfill its responsibility. Not 
that the issues are simple or easy, but the FTC is supposed to 
fill gaps that occur when Congress sometimes fails to do so. I 
understand that members of the panel have expressed 
reservations about it. I am not sure I understand the 
preemption objection. I think the resource issue can be 
surmounted.
    And if Congress were willing to act, of course, that might 
be everyone's preference, but it is what it is, and in the 
meantime, states are also filling the gap. That is the nature 
of our Federal system, right, laboratories of democracy. But 
the FTC should start the clock on primary rule--privacy rules. 
Either Congress acts or the Commission does, and FTC rulemaking 
at the very least would build a record and provide 
recommendations to Congress for action. Tomorrow, Senator 
Blackburn and I are holding a hearing in our subcommittee on 
Consumer Protection about how platforms like Facebook and 
Instagram harm the mental health of children and teens, not 
only invade privacy, but actually knowingly harm children, and 
in fact, how they have concealed that harm and their knowledge 
of it.
    Over the last two weeks, there have been some pretty 
chilling revelations about Facebook, including an article just 
yesterday about its efforts to insert itself into the play 
dates of children. This would be laughable to a parent who 
finds it impossible to insert himself or herself into play 
dates, but it is deathly serious. There are widespread issues 
with Facebook and kids, including the fact that there are 
already millions of teens on Instagram, despite restrictions 
under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
    The decision to pause Instagram for Kids is a positive 
step, but too little, and there should be a permanent pause. I 
am troubled that the mental health and safety of teens and 
children are seemingly treated as an afterthought by big tech. 
These issues of grooming, manipulative advertising, addiction 
and abuse are rampant.
    These practices hurt kids. And what we have all seen from 
Facebook, I think is deeply disturbing. I know, in Connecticut, 
outrage is an understatement as to what many moms feel about 
how their daughters are exposed to the kind of harm that has 
been depicted so graphically by the whistleblower and the 
documents that whistleblower revealed to The Wall Street 
Journal.
    So I would like to ask Mr. Soltani, in your testimony you 
talk about how existing enforcement tools don't sufficiently 
address, and I am quoting, ``the psychological harms caused to 
teens by social media.'' What additional resources and 
authorities do you believe the FTC needs to confront this toxic 
relationship between teens and big tech? And if we have time, I 
will let others comment on it as well. Mr. Soltani?
    Mr. Soltani. Thank you for the question, Senator. 
Absolutely, I think you need both resources and authorities. So 
as I have said previously, the FTC has limited ability to go 
after these types of data abuses or data harms under the 
unfairness authority, particularly because they are often hard 
to demonstrate. Perhaps, maybe not as much on the issue of 
kids, but often in any discrimination or any manipulation and 
dark patterns, it is very hard to get to in fairness. So often 
the FTC relies on its deception or its deception authority 
under Section 5.
    And so I think having either in legislation or additional 
authorities for the FTC or at least clarifying that the FTC 
should issue rules around abuse--data abuse and the use of 
essentially manipulating dark patterns. Additionally, I think 
the resources that we are discussing in this hearing today are 
absolutely critical, right. So right now, if you go to Facebook 
or Instagram, there are multiple data scientist roles for 
Instagram youth. And they are essentially for to find 
innovative ways to tackle appropriate content standards via 
data analysis, experimentation, and statistical modeling.
    The FTC needs experts that can understand and perform the 
same research, evaluate the work that Facebook and others are 
doing to perform the manipulation and the targeting in order to 
assess whether it is, in fact, harmful or problematic. And so I 
think in addition to authorities having experts in kids 
psychology, behavioral economics, design the UX and choice 
architecture, which is a lot of what this work is, is giving 
people, you know, manipulating people's choice, I think are 
going to be critical.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you very much for that response. 
I--my time has expired, so I would invite others to respond in 
writing, if you wish to do so. Very much appreciate all of you 
being here. Thank you.
    The Chairwoman. Thank you, Senator Blumenthal. And thank 
you for your leadership at the Subcommittee level on this 
important issue and for your work with many of our colleagues 
on this and your letters. Thank you. That is continued focus on 
a very needed area.
    I thank all of our witnesses today for testifying before 
the Committee. The hearing will remain open for a time period 
for members to submit questions. We ask you to respond to those 
in a timely fashion. And again, we appreciate the details and 
the information from the hearing today. We are adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:29 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

    Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Ray Ben Lujan to 
                            David C. Vladeck
    Question. As FTC Chair Lina Khan noted, the commodification of 
sensitive health information for behavioral ads or user analytics is a 
serious concern for user privacy. Question. How should Congress and the 
FTC protect sensitive health information from commodification? What 
additional safeguards are necessary to ensure this information is 
protected from data breaches or other nonconsensual distribution?
    Answer. The question is a vexing one because it exposes the 
weakness in the statutory mandate of the Federal Trade Commission to 
safeguard consumer privacy. The FTC's consumer protection remit is to 
``prevent'' ``unfair and deceptive acts and practices in or affecting 
commerce.'' 15 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 45(a)(1) & (2). Congress has confined 
the FTC's ``unfairness'' mandate by requiring that an act be not only 
``unfair'' to consumers, but also that the consumer could not 
``reasonably avoid[]'' the unfair act. Id. at 45(n). Equally 
problematic, the FTC's deception authority depends on false, 
misleading, or omitted claims. Because consumers must ``consent'' to 
use websites, the harvesting of data is not necessarily deceptive. The 
FTC has long sought legislation to enable it to provide robust 
protection of sensitive data. After all, companies often use that data 
used for purposes that may be harmful to consumers. As I made clear in 
my written testimony, I urge Congress to enact more targeted general 
legislation giving the FTC the tools it needs to protect consumer 
privacy--tools the FTC has sought for several decades.

    Question. Consumer Comprehension. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we 
have all learned how to use a lot of new online tools--whether for 
work, school, or telehealth. And most of the time that we log into 
these new applications, we're given a 10 or 20 page ``privacy policy'' 
that is full of complicated legal language and jargon, and many 
consumers are left confused about what their rights are and what they 
have signed away. Question. How can Congress and the FTC make it easier 
for consumers--especially those with lower levels of digital literacy--
to understand and control how their data is used and collected?
    Answer. At least since my tenure at the FTC, starting in 2009, the 
Commission has railed at the ``privacy policies'' as little more than 
obfuscation for consumers. Consumers have to endure to try to 
understand the basic questions about what consumer data is being 
harvested, by what companies, and for what purposes? What are companies 
doing with that data? Is the data being used for targeted ads? Are 
companies using your personal information to make ads even more 
effective? Are the companies engaged in geolocation tracking? Are 
companies selling your data to other companies? And if so, to what 
companies, and for what purposes? I could go on. But you see my point. 
Lawyers write privacy policies to provide enough information so that 
the policy is not deceptive, but no more information than is absolutely 
necessary.
    My view is that the term ``privacy policy'' is a gross misnomer. 
These policies are not ``privacy policies'' at all. Most of these 
policies deal with data-acquisition and use; not privacy. In truth, 
they are data use policies, which are invariably non-negotiable. 
Consumers use websites and apps on a take-it-or-leave it basis, and 
consumers rarely leave it because they need to be able to engage in our 
digital economy.
    As with the prior question, the FTC cannot change the status quo 
without clearer, more powerful, and more targeted tools to protect 
consumer privacy on line. This question, like the one submitted by 
Senator Lujan, goes to the heart of the FTC's limited ability to 
protect consumer privacy. I urge the Committee to continue to develop 
legislation aimed at addressing these and other issues relating to 
online privacy.

     Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. John Thune to 
                            David C. Vladeck
    Question. Do you believe that a single national privacy standard 
should provide consumers with more control of their data and how do we 
ensure that data is protected?
    Answer. Yes, I believe that it is time for Congress to enact 
comprehensive privacy legislation that provides consumers far more 
control of their data than they can exercise at the present. The FTC's 
existing mandate permits the Commission to reign in practices that are 
deceptive and unfair, but that mandate is insufficient to provide 
robust privacy protection, especially when services are offered on a 
take-it-or-leave it basis.
    Equally problematic is that all too often companies do not make 
sufficient investment in safeguarding data, including data that has 
commercial value (like payment card information) or is sensitive for 
other reasons. The FTC has brought dozens of enforcement cases against 
companies that have failed to take reasonable measures to secure 
sensitive information, but apart from bringing an enforcement action 
and getting the company under order, there is no redress or penalty for 
first violations under the Federal Trade Commission Act. As a result, 
deterrence kicks in only after a company has experienced a breach due 
to unduly lax security. Congress needs to authorize the FTC to impose 
civil penalties on first offenders, or else the status quo will remain 
in place and companies will get at least one free bite at the apple.

    Question. Over the past few years, developers have been creating 
new financial services apps directed towards children. As more parents 
sign their kids up for these apps, it raises questions about what kinds 
of data they are collecting and how they use it.
    Do you share these concerns and what steps do you think we should 
take to get a better handle on this issue?
    Answer. I share your concerns, and worry that parents might sign up 
their children for these apps without any understanding about what data 
the companies are collecting and how that data is being used. Of course 
Congress, with its broad investigatory powers, could undertake an 
investigation. But so too could the FTC. But your question underscores 
the need to provide more resources to the FTC, which is severely under-
staffed and under-funded. Until the FTC is adequately resourced, it 
will necessarily engage in triage, leaving some important matters 
unaddressed, or deferred. With needed resources, the FTC could 
undertake an investigation of these apps to answer the questions you 
pose about data harvesting and use. The FTC could do so by 
investigating a few companies offering these apps, or, if appropriate, 
through a broader industry study under the FTC's authority under 6(b) 
of the FTC Act. In that event, the FTC would then issue a report 
addressing the questions you posed, and thus give parents the 
information they need to make an informed decision.

    Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Ben Ray Lujan to 
                          Maureen K. Ohlhausen
    I'm especially concerned by websites collecting personal 
information when a user hasn't entered into any agreement or been 
presented with information on how that collected information may be 
used or sold.

    Question. How should the FTC and Congress protect the data of 
individuals who have never signed up for an account or signed terms of 
service?
    Answer. Section 5 of the FTC Act gives the FTC authority to prevent 
``unfair'' acts or practices that cause or are likely to cause 
substantial harm to consumers that consumers cannot reasonably avoid 
and that are not outweighed by countervailing benefits to competition 
or consumers. Using this authority, the FTC has brought enforcement 
actions in situations where websites that do not have relationships 
with individual consumers collect their personal information and use it 
in a way that harms them or collect consumers' sensitive personal 
information without their consent.
    While the FTC has used its limited authority in these situations, 
Congress can provide even greater protections to consumers by enacting 
comprehensive, technology neutral, national privacy legislation that 
provides clear protections for consumers, articulates specific limits 
on companies' ability to collect, use, and share sensitive personal 
information, and grants the FTC the resources and explicit authority 
necessary to enforce a new law.

learned how to use a lot of new online tools--whether for work, school,

    Question. How can Congress and the FTC make it easier for 
consumers--especially those with lower levels of digital literacy--to 
understand and control how their data is used and collected?
    Answer. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a rapid shift to 
online work and learning, which makes even more apparent the need for 
comprehensive privacy legislation that makes privacy protections 
uniform, clear, and transparent. Congress should enact Federal privacy 
legislation that includes several key attributes that will help make 
privacy policies clearer and simpler for all Americans. First, 
legislation should provide a national and uniform set of protections 
and consumer rights throughout our digital economy. Second, it should 
ensure strong enforcement that protects consumer information that could 
result in harm if disclosed or misused, while also allowing companies 
to provide and develop innovative products and services that consumers 
want. Third, it should provide consumers clarity and visibility into 
companies' data collection, use, and sharing practices, as well as 
easily understandable choices regarding these practices, calibrated to 
the sensitivity of that data. Fourth, legislation should be more 
comprehensive than current state laws, such as the CCPA, addressing 
more elements of the data cycle. Fifth, Federal privacy legislation 
should be enforced by the FTC, which has the experience and skill to 
meaningfully enforce a new law's protections, supplemented by state 
attorneys general.

    Question 1. Do you believe a single national privacy standard 
should provide consumers with more control of their data and how do we 
ensure that data is protected?
    Answer. Yes, I believe a single national privacy law would provide 
consistent enhanced protections to consumers throughout the United 
States, which means they would have this increased control regardless 
of where they live, work, or visit. Congress should ensure that a 
single national privacy law includes strong privacy protections.

    Question 2. I believe it is Congress' responsibility to take action 
on privacy legislation rather than punting it to the FTC. Can you talk 
about some of the challenges the FTC would have by conducting a non-
preemptive rulemaking to address privacy concerns?
    Answer. I have three primary concerns about a non-preemptive FTC 
rulemaking. First, given the scope of the FTC's current statutory 
authority, an FTC rulemaking could not be as comprehensive as 
legislation. Second, under the FTC's Magnuson-Moss rulemaking 
requirements, a general privacy rulemaking involves a cumbersome 
process and is time-consuming. Third, a non-preemptive rulemaking could 
cause confusion and uncertainty about what requirements apply in a 
particular state and create regulatory complexity that hurts small 
business.

    Question 3. The PACT Act, Section 230 legislation I introduced with 
Senator Schatz would, among other things, provide that the immunity 
provided by Section 230 does not apply to civil enforcement actions 
brought by the Federal government.
    Do you believe that by reforming Section 230 to ensure that the 
immunity provided by Section 230 does not apply to civil enforcement 
actions brought by the Federal government, such as the FTC, would 
benefit consumers?
    Answer. Unfortunately, Section 230 is beyond my areas of expertise.

    Question 1. I share the concerns you highlighted in your testimony 
about the FTC moving forward with a privacy rulemaking without a 
Federal law enacted by Congress to set the guidelines for consumers and 
businesses. I introduced the Browser Act (one of the first bipartisan 
privacy bills in Congress), as well as the Safe Data Act with Senator 
Wicker, and am fully committed to getting a Federal privacy law across 
the finish line. So I'm understandably wary of actions the FTC has 
taken to short circuit its rulemaking procedures in order to plow ahead 
with a privacy rulemaking.
    Can you walk us through some of the problems here?
    Is this a way to enact policies that might not get bipartisan 
support in Congress--or even things the FTC might not be legally 
authorized to do?
    Answer. I have three primary concerns about an FTC general privacy 
rulemaking. First, given the scope of the FTC's current statutory 
authority, an FTC rulemaking could not be as comprehensive as 
legislation. Second, under the FTC's Magnuson-Moss rulemaking 
requirements, a general privacy rulemaking involves a cumbersome 
process and is time-consuming. Third, a non-preemptive rulemaking could 
cause confusion and uncertainty about what requirements apply in a 
particular state, and create regulatory complexity that hurts small 
business.

    Question 2. When you were an FTC Commissioner, you played a key 
role in negotiating the privacy shield for international data transfers 
after the ``safe harbor'' provisions were struck down.
    How was the U.S. able to come to a deal with the EU last time, and 
why are we struggling to provide this certainty to businesses and 
consumers now?
    Answer. While we reached an agreement on the Privacy Shield last 
time, the European court eventually found it was not sufficient. Having 
a comprehensive Federal law may help support a lasting EU determination 
that our privacy law is adequate under EU law, thereby providing 
greater certainty to businesses and consumers.

    NOTE: The following responses are provided in my personal capacity 
and do not reflect or represent the views of any employer, past or 
present.

    Question. In your testimony, you refer to the need to enable to FTC 
to better compete and retain talented individuals with relevant skills 
and experience. What reforms do you believe would be most impactful in 
making the Commission more competitive when hiring for top-level 
talent?
    Answer. As I noted in my testimony, based on my experiences as 
Chief Technologist of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the FTC needs 
more resources to hire technologists and to attract top talent. I 
appreciate Senator Lujan's continued commitment to helping to ensure 
that the FTC has the resources it needs to build its technology staff. 
For example, Senator Lujan's Federal Trade Commission Technologists 
Act, which was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. 
McNerney of California, provides funding to create a separate Office of 
Technology in the FTC, staffed with at least 25 technologists. This 
would be an excellent first step in building the FTC's capacity to 
police unfair and deceptive practices related to privacy and data 
security.
    Senator Lujan's bill is important not only because it would allow 
the FTC to hire more technologists, but because the creation of a 
separate office for technologists would allow them to more effectively 
support all FTC divisions. Technologist support is important not only 
for the Division of Privacy and Identity Protection (DPIP), which 
initiates investigations, but for the enforcement team as well, which 
is a separate division that oversees compliance with FTC orders across 
all divisions. Technologist support is also needed at the Bureau of 
Competition, since technology and data pervade nearly every case that 
comes before the Commission. Housing the technologists in a separate 
office will make it more likely that they will be able to provide 
support across the Commission.
    Of course, it's also important to attract and retain top talent. 
Top technologists would likely make far less in the public sector than 
they could in the private sector. At minimum, the FTC should be 
prepared to match candidates' existing salaries.

    Consumer Comprehension. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have all 
learned how to use a lot of new online tools--whether for work, school, 
or telehealth. And most of the time that we log into these new 
applications, we're given a 10 or 20 page ``privacy policy'' that is 
full of complicated legal language and jargon, and many consumers are 
left confused about what their rights are and what they have signed 
away.
    Question. How can Congress and the FTC make it easier for 
consumers--especially those with lower levels of digital literacy--to 
understand and control how their data is used and collected?
    Answer. I can certainly sympathize with consumers who are 
frustrated by incomprehensible privacy policies. Businesses should be 
required to clearly outline their data practices--not only to inform 
consumers, but so that enforcement authorities can hold businesses 
accountable for wrongdoing. California has been a leader in this space, 
and as early as 2003, adopted the California Online Privacy Protection 
Act (CalOPPA), becoming the first state to require businesses to 
outline their data practices in a public privacy policy.
    In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as 
amended by Proposition 24, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 
(CCPA), takes steps to make privacy policies accessible for the public. 
Under the CCPA, California consumers have the right to know what 
personal information a business has collected about them and how it is 
used and shared. The California law requires businesses to inform 
consumers of the categories of information it has collected, the 
categories of sources from which it was collected, the business or 
commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal 
information, and the categories of third parties to whom the business 
discloses personal information.
    Importantly, the CCPA regulations require businesses to ensure that 
the notices and information that businesses are required to provide, 
are presented in a manner that may be easily understood by the average 
consumer, are accessible to consumers with disabilities, and are 
available in the language primarily used to interact with the consumer. 
This performance-based approach clarifies that disclosures and 
communications must be designed and presented in a way that is easy to 
read and understandable by consumers, including those with 
disabilities. And the regulations use the language of ``reasonably 
accessible to consumers with disabilities'' to acknowledge that the 
definition of disabilities may be broad, and thus, the business's 
obligations are tied to a generally recognized industry standard such 
as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.\1\

    \1\ Cal. Code Regs. tit. 11 Sec. 7011
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition, businesses are currently required by CCPA regulation 
to honor browser privacy signals as a global opt out of sale, so that 
consumers can exercise their privacy preferences with covered 
businesses in a single step,\2\ rather than needing to seek out 
cumbersome settings with every business they interact with. These 
provisions together help make the CCPA workable for consumers of all 
levels of literacy and sophistication.

    Lastly, the CCPA is not only designed to make it easy for consumers 
to exercise their rights, it also provides protections beyond just 
``notice and choice'' through its data minimization and purpose 
limitation provisions. The CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, introduces 
data minimization and purpose limitation provisions that put limits on 
the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personal information 
in the first place, so that consumer privacy is protected by 
default.\3\ These provisions are described in more detail in the next 
response.

    Data Minimization Requirements. In 2018, the Supreme Court held 
that under the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement officers must apply 
for a warrant to obtain cell-site location data from wireless carriers. 
That is because location data can reveal intimate details about our 
lives. Recently, however, we have seen reports that law enforcement 
agencies are obtaining consumers' location data through commercial 
vendors, bypassing these Constitutional protections. One way to curb 
these practices would be to require that technology companies employ 
data minimization practices, so that data could only be stored for 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
specific purposes.

    Question. Do you believe data minimization procedures would help 
protect consumer privacy?
    Answer. Yes. Data minimization and purpose limitation provisions 
are increasingly common in privacy legislation. These provisions 
typically prohibit unnecessary collection, use, retention, and 
disclosure of personal information--and in so doing, enable consumers 
to use online products and services safely, without having to take 
additional steps to protect their privacy. Data minimization and 
purpose limitation language was added to the California Consumer 
Privacy Act by Proposition 24, and uses language consistent with 
language in Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the 
Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, and 
Connecticut's new privacy law--highlighting its increased currency. The 
CCPA as amended by Proposition 24 states, ``A business's collection, 
use, retention, and sharing of a consumer's personal information shall 
be reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purposes for 
which the personal information was collected or processed, or for 
another disclosed purpose that is compatible with the context in which 
the personal information was collected, and not further processed in a 
manner that is incompatible with those purposes.'' \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ Civil Code Sec. 1798.100(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition, two new California laws have placed new data 
minimization requirements on certain covered businesses. For example, 
SB 1172, the Student Test Taker Privacy Protection Act, provides that, 
subject to certain exemptions, ``a business providing proctoring 
services in an educational setting shall collect, use, retain, and 
disclose only the personal information strictly necessary to provide 
those services.'' \5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Similarly, AB 2273, the California Age-Appropriate Design Code, has 
several provisions that minimize data processing. For example, it 
provides that, subject to certain exemptions, a covered business may 
not collect, share, sell, or retain any personal information that is 
not necessary to provide a product, service, or feature with which a 
child is actively and knowingly engaged, unless the business can 
demonstrate a compelling reason that such processing is in the best 
interests of children likely to access the product, service, or 
feature. Additionally, the law provides that businesses may not 
collect, sell, or share precise geolocation information of children by 
default, unless the collection is strictly necessary to provide the 
requested product, service, or feature, and only then for the limited 
time that such collection is necessary to provide it.\6\

    Both measures, like the CCPA as amended, limit the personal 
information businesses can collect and use to what the average consumer 
would expect in that situation without having to obtain explicit 
consent.

   Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Raphael Warnock to 
                              Morgan Reed
    Consumer Comprehension. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have all 
learned how to use a lot of new online tools--whether for work, school, 
or telehealth. And most of the time that we log into these new 
applications, we're given a 10 or 20 page ``privacy policy'' that is 
full of complicated legal language and jargon, and many consumers are 
left confused about what their rights are and what they have signed 
away.

    Question. How can Congress and the FTC make it easier for 
consumers--especially those with lower levels of digital literacy--to 
understand and control how their data is used and collected?
    Answer. ACT | The App Association recognizes that the modern notice 
and consent model is not always a sufficient means of communicating 
privacy expectations or establishing a relationship of trust. Consent 
often fails to contemplate dynamic uses of data and does not 
encapsulate consumers' future expectations given the passage of time or 
changing contexts. We believe Congress has the best position, through 
the framework of a Federal privacy law, to retool the consent model so 
that it centers on consumer experience while preserving the ability for 
small innovators to compete and develop better privacy practices and 
communication methods.
    Our members currently leverage several promising efforts developed 
at the platform level to enhance consumer understanding and control 
over their data outside of the traditional privacy policy paradigm. For 
example, Apple recently introduced privacy ``nutrition'' labels that 
allow app developers to give users a more intuitive sense of the app's 
privacy policies, allowing good actors to easily demonstrate their 
commitment to responsible privacy stewardship. The nutrition label 
surfaces key information for users, saving them from having to dig 
through the entire privacy policy. Apple's new App Tracking 
Transparency tool also provides an easy and efficient way for users to 
opt-out of unwanted tracking that follows them outside of the app onto 
websites or even other third-party apps. Proposals introduced by the 
Chair and Ranking Member of the committee, including the SAFE DATA Act 
and Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA), align with those 
advancements by requiring consumer friendly opt-out rights for non-
sensitive personal information. As Congress and the Federal Trade 
Commission debate future policymaking on privacy issues, they should 
consider how they can encourage and incentivize further development of 
such privacy-enhancing technologies. At the same time, Congress should 
also reject proposals like the American Innovation and Choice Act (S. 
2992), which would expand the scope of antitrust law in ways that 
presume the illegality of these platform level privacy controls.
    Another consideration is that our Nation's current patchwork 
approach to privacy, with incongruous sectoral privacy laws (including 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act) and growing differences among the states, greatly 
contributes to consumer confusion. A Federal privacy law that creates 
strong consumer rights will raise the baseline of protection, ensuring 
that no matter where in the country a person lives, they enjoy certain 
protections. In particular, a Federal law should empower consumers to 
exert more control over their personal information, including the 
rights to access, correction, and deletion of such information. 
Sensitive personal information should also be subject to some limits on 
processing activities that pose too great a risk to consumers, which is 
not outweighed by countervailing benefits.
                                 ______
                                 
     Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. John Thune to 
                              Morgan Reed
    Question 1. Do you believe a single national privacy standard 
should provide consumers with more control of their data and how do we 
ensure that data is protected?
    Answer. Yes. Let me break this question down into its constituent 
parts:

  1.  A single, national privacy standard. Ensuring that a general, 
        Federal consumer privacy law is the law of the land across all 
        states is critical to achieving Congress' goals in this space 
        and is the best outcome for App Association members and your 
        constituents for a few reasons:

      a.  Compliance. Our member companies may be the smallest software 
            and connected device makers, but they are not afraid of 
            complying with strong privacy laws. Yet, what separates 
            them from much larger companies is that they have a lower 
            tolerance for compliance with slightly differing regimes 
            across states, whether those differences directly conflict 
            or not. This is especially true if complying with different 
            obligations requires substantial expenditures that do not 
            result in greater consumer protection. Compliance for 
            compliance's sake imposes needless costs on small firms in 
            the app economy and is an inefficient way of changing 
            behavior, which we know is a major aim of privacy 
            legislation. In fact, the lack of a single set of Federal 
            rules has led small companies not to invest, in large part 
            due to uncertainty about how states will legislate on 
            privacy. As our member company Walker Tracker has shared, 
            they mainly ruled out smaller clients and smaller contracts 
            due to uncertainty about privacy compliance costs in the 
            next year. These are tangible costs that affect your 
            constituents and our member companies.

      b.  Consumer benefit. Although states actively compete with each 
            other to provide better (a subjective concept) privacy 
            protections than their peers, these differing regimes may 
            actually be unhelpful for consumers, especially in today's 
            mobile environment. A major feature of most of these state 
            proposals and new laws is a set of consumer rights to 
            access, correct, and delete information about themselves 
            held by covered companies. To the extent that the 
            dimensions of these rights and the process used to 
            effectuate them differ, consumers are likely to be confused 
            about how it is supposed to work. Each state might 
            carefully design the process they envision to be user-
            friendly and therefore effective protections, but a South 
            Dakota resident might think California's privacy law 
            applies to her, but she would be wrong. If South Dakota 
            enacts a general privacy law with consumer rights, covering 
            South Dakota residents, she would be able to exercise those 
            rights--but how do they differ from California's process, 
            which the press continues to cover much more extensively? 
            Is it even worth trying to make use of them when the 
            company actually calibrated its compliance program to 
            California's law and has not yet figured out how to deal 
            with South Dakota's? This scenario does not help the South 
            Dakota resident much.

      c.  Global Competitiveness. Europe's General Data Protection 
            Regulation (GDPR), despite its flaws, is mainly preemptive 
            of analogous Member State privacy laws. Through a single 
            set of privacy laws that govern the continent, the European 
            Union (EU) made a statement to its global trading partners 
            and others that it is both serious about privacy and that 
            processing data on EU subjects would involve compliance 
            with a single set of laws (albeit enforced differently by 
            Member State data protection authorities). Placing American 
            companies at a relative disadvantage by saddling them with 
            anywhere from three to 50 different privacy regimes across 
            the states hurts our privacy profile in the trade context 
            and also undermines global competitive of U.S. based 
            industries.

  2.  Putting consumers more in control of their data. A Federal law 
        should empower consumers to exert more control over their 
        personal information, including the rights to access, 
        correction, and deletion of such information. Sensitive 
        personal information should also be subject to some limits on 
        processing activities that pose too great a risk to consumers, 
        which is not outweighed by countervailing benefits.

  3.  Better data protection. Federal privacy legislation should 
        include a data security requirement. We support the SAFE DATA 
        Act (S. 2499), a version of which you co-authored last year. 
        This Congress' version includes a data security requirement at 
        Section 203, which strikes a good balance. Specifically, it 
        requires covered entities to maintain reasonable a) 
        administrative, b) technical, and c) physical data security 
        policies and practices to protect against risks to the 
        confidentiality, security, and integrity of covered data. 
        Notably, the requirements are scalable insofar as they must be 
        appropriate to the size and complexity of the covered entity; 
        the nature and scope of the covered entity's collection or 
        processing of covered data; the volume and nature of the 
        covered data; and the costs of available tools to improve 
        security and reduce vulnerabilities. Section 203 also provides 
        that the required data security practices take baseline 
        measures to address security threats, and that they are 
        designed to: identify and assess vulnerabilities; take 
        reasonable preventative and corrective action to address known 
        vulnerabilities; and detect, respond to, and recover from 
        security incidents. These are robust requirements that exceed 
        most state law requirements and would better protect consumers 
        from the threat of data security incidents, while allowing 
        flexibility for smaller companies to comply and compete.

  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Marsha Blackburn to 
                              Morgan Reed
    Question 1. You represent many members of the app ecosystem.
    Are any of your members engaged in marketing financial service apps 
to kids? If so, what are they doing to protect kids' personal and 
financial data?
    Answer. REGO Payment Architectures offers an app available now on 
the App Store, Mazoola, marketed to parents to enable their kids to 
engage in limited digital transactions, with parental control and 
guidance. As a financial services company, Mazoola is subject to the 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)--but is not necessarily required to 
comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). 
Nonetheless, Mazoola complies with both GLBA and COPPA and requires 
parents to provide verifiable parental consent (VPC) before they 
collect any data pertaining to children under the age of 13. By 
complying with both regimes, Mazoola observes strict rules around 
consent for collection of data found in COPPA rules and also complies 
with the robust Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Safeguards Rule under 
GLBA. The FTC is actively reviewing the Safeguards Rule and has 
proposed updates including a requirement for financial institutions to 
use strong encryption to protect financial information, including when 
it pertains to children.
    Your question also raises a concern we have with how the FTC tries 
to address privacy gaps in the absence of Federal privacy legislation. 
For example, the FTC issued a policy statement on September 15, 2021, 
indicating its intention to enforce its health breach notification rule 
in situations that do not involve a data breach. Specifically, the 
statement articulates the FTC's position that the rule applies when 
companies engage in ``sharing of covered information without an 
individual's authorization.'' \1\ Sharing of information on purpose 
with a third party without proper consent or authorization, or in a 
manner that disrespects the context and expectations of a consumer, is 
a privacy issue, not a data breach. The FTC's statement, therefore, is 
concerning and is both an inadequate and a confusing fix in the absence 
of Congress providing authority for it to stop and prevent privacy 
harms. A similar situation could arise in the context of financial 
services, where a gap arguably exists in the applicability of COPPA to 
financial institutions. Leaving gaps creates risks for consumers and 
businesses, especially with the aggressive posture of the current FTC, 
and that further underscores the need for Congress to enact a single, 
Federal set of rules on privacy that address these gaps.

    Question 2. In your testimony, you mention the Open App Markets 
Act, my bill with Senators Blumenthal and Klobuchar, and suggest that 
legislation like ours would open the door to malware and privacy harms. 
While I fully appreciate the need to ensure privacy and security on all 
of our devices, I also find it interesting that a senior engineer at 
Apple was quoted as saying its app store security now is like 
``bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight.'' It's also curious 
that other decisions to exclude apps, like the Navalny opposition app 
in Russia, are made without any claims about security or privacy.
    It seems like these companies should be able to protect user 
privacy without using it as a smokescreen to keep out competition or to 
justify political decisions--do you have ideas on how to do that?
    Answer. While Apple's security capabilities are not perfect--and 
perfect security really does not exist--its track record is 
demonstrably better than other software platforms in the market. For 
example, over the past four years, Android devices were found to have 
15 to 47 times more malware infections (the variation attributable to 
the variety of different kinds of Android devices) than iOS devices.\2\ 
This is no accident. Even if there is something to what the senior 
engineer who called out Apple's security practices said, the policy of 
prohibiting sideloading is not a technical measure but a structural 
control to avoid risk surfaces altogether. While some critics suggest 
software platforms need not prohibit sideloading to maintain a secure 
environment, experience shows the opposite is true. Disallowing 
sideloading--or in Android's case, requiring consumers to overcome 
default settings to allow sideloading--helps keep both marketplaces 
safer and more trusted than they would be otherwise. And that focus on 
security creates the necessary conditions for App Association members 
to succeed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    App store decisions with respect to allowing or disallowing apps on 
their platforms are also imperfect. Political pressure to allow or 
disallow apps is unfortunately common and our member companies have 
concerns if approval or removal decisions appear to have political 
motivations, especially if they might be applied differently from how 
they would be applied to smaller companies that do not appear in 
political headlines. However, App Association members currently have a 
choice between distinct software platforms through which to offer their 
products and services. Even though they are not happy with every app 
review decision, they are not asking government officials or a Federal 
regulation to supplant app store determinations, and if that were to 
happen, undue political influence on app removal or approval decisions 
could worsen. They would prefer the market for developer services to 
drive those results.
    A Federal privacy regime, similar to what you proposed with the 
SAFE DATA Act, would help ensure that privacy is not a smokescreen for 
anticompetitive conduct in a few ways. First, SAFE DATA includes a 
right to data portability that requires covered entities to provide 
certain data of an individual in a portable, structured, and machine-
readable format that is not subject to licensing restrictions. This 
provision would help ensure that large social media platforms, for 
example, are not thwarting a consumer's ability to port their own data 
to a new service with obstacles that have little privacy value and an 
anticompetitive purpose. Second, it is important that strong privacy 
and data security requirements accompany any portability or 
interoperability mandate and this Congress' SAFE DATA Act checks both 
of those boxes. Portability and interoperability should not flip the 
FTC's own mantra of ``privacy by design'' to a new ethos of ``access by 
design.'' Lastly, a Federal privacy regime would establish a common 
understanding of privacy requirements, definitions, and obligations 
across the broad swath of the economy not otherwise subject to Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), GLBA, or similar 
industry-specific laws. Such a regime would help policymakers and 
enforcers distinguish legitimate privacy measures the law requires or 
condones against those that harm consumers and competition more than 
they benefit the market.
