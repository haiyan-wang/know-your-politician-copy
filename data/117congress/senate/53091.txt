                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:01 a.m., in

         OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT

    Senator Blumenthal. Welcome to this hearing, Protecting 
Kids Online. I want to thank Ranking Member Blackburn and our 
witnesses for being here today. Her collaboration has been 
invaluable, and I am looking forward to the excellent 
observations that we will hear from you and from the United 
Kingdom.
    As children spend drastically more time online, the tech 
platforms really have become a perilous mine field for many of 
them. They are deeply addictive and potentially destructive 
without sufficient parental supervision or safeguards. I fought 
for data privacy rules for consumers and accountability for 
tech companies, focusing on the harms that they cause. Nowhere 
is that more profound and urgent than for children.
    Big Tech and data brokers are spying on children, watching 
them play, monitoring their lives. No company should be allowed 
to collect permanent, invasive dossiers on our children. Even 
more concerning are the cesspool of illicit pitches to kids. In 
a survey last week, by the antihuman trafficking organization, 
THORN, the finding was that more than a quarter of children 
nine to 11 years old receive sexual solicitations on social 
media, often by adults. A quarter of those children receive 
sexual solicitation.
    These children are also assailed by aggressive, 
sophisticated, and undisclosed marketing that prey on their 
impressionable minds, and exploit those dossiers of private 
information for commercial gain. Two examples, one TikTok, the 
other Instagram. According to THORN, 66 percent of young 
children, nine to 12 years old, use the video sharing app, 
TikTok. It can often be informative and entertaining. It has 
held itself out to parents to be safe. But it has aggressively 
recruited young users.
    Regrettably, TikTok has a troubling track record on 
children's privacy. Only 2 years ago, TikTok paid a then record 
$5.7 million fine for disregarding our children's privacy rules 
and illegally collecting data about kids. It then shared this 
sensitive information with third parties and advertisers. This 
practice still continues. In March 2020, children's advocates, 
led by Professor Campbell, filed a complaint with the Federal 
Trade Commission, alleging TikTok continues to violate the law. 
TikTok is also facing investigations in Europe, for failing to 
protect children.
    Privacy is not the only issue. Organizations like the 
National Center on Sexual Exploitation and the Center for 
Digital Democracy have all raised concerns about predatory 
sexual content and manipulative advertising on TikTok. The FTC 
even called attention to TikTok being used by predators to 
groom nearby children, in its case against the company.
    Because TikTok is so popular with young audiences, Ranking 
Member Blackburn and I invited the company to this hearing. We 
asked them to come in and explain how they are safeguarding 
children. Parents deserve to hear from TikTok, and I am 
disappointed that TikTok rejected our invitation and refused to 
discuss these issues with Congress. We are going to continue to 
invite them to come. I hope that they will give parents and 
Congress the explanations we deserve. They have been failing to 
do it.
    I am also alarmed by Facebook's recent announcement that it 
will launch a version of Instagram marketed to children. 
Instagram has a notorious record of disinformation, bullying, 
and deception. Prominent Instagram influencers often push 
alcohol, tobacco, and other dangerous products on young fans, 
despite warnings from the FTC.
    Sexual exploitation is also a problem. According to THORN, 
16 percent of children and teens that have been sexually 
harassed on Instagram, tied with Snapchat for the most reports 
of harm. I have no trust, none, that Facebook will keep these 
young users safe. It has failed far too often. For example, one 
design flaw in its Messenger Kids app allowed strangers to chat 
with children. Given that record, I cannot imagine why Facebook 
would bulldoze ahead into kids' lives.
    Senator Markey and I wrote to Facebook, asking questions 
about its plans and we have received woefully inadequate 
answers. I agree that--I agree with the 44 State Attorneys 
General, and dozens of child welfare specialists saying, no. 
Facebook should abandon its plans for Instagram Kids. Facebook 
should stop this additional intrusive, and potentially 
dangerous, interference in kids' lives and abandon plans for 
Instagram Kids.
    As for the way forward, we must stop these business 
practices, corporate negligence, and commercial exploitation of 
children that now exists online. Spying and preying on children 
is never OK. Parents are powerless to prevent it now. They need 
the tools to stop it themselves, or Congress must intervene to 
end it.
    I commend my colleagues, Senators Markey and Cassidy, for 
introducing the bipartisan Children and Teens Online Privacy 
Protection Act. I worked on this issue with them, and I will be 
strongly supporting and advocating such measures.
    But we need to do more. The EARN IT Act, that Senator 
Graham and I introduced last session, approved unanimously by 
the Senate Judiciary Committee, offers a template for even 
broader action on Section 230. Eventually, the tech platforms 
must be held accountable. They must bear liability for obvious 
violations of criminal and perhaps civil law. And the cutbacks 
in Section 230 immunity, carefully tailored to meet the needs 
of harm to children, offer a very important path forward.
    And I also commend the trailblazing work of Baroness Kidron 
to draft an age-appropriate design code and an online safety 
bill in the United Kingdom. It, too, offers a potential model 
for us.
    I now turn to Ranking Member Blackburn.

              STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE

    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to 
welcome our witnesses, Mr. Egelman, Ms. Campbell, who are with 
us in person, and Baroness Kidron, who is joining us remotely 
today. And to our staffs who have worked on this issue, I thank 
you for doing the work to put this hearing together.
    Mr. Chairman, I join you in being disappointed with how 
TikTok has refused to appear before us and remain disappointed 
and really frustrated with them and their lack of attention to 
data security, to children's privacy. And it seems that TikTok 
is proving to be incapable of doing the right thing, to protect 
our children.
    The Internet has completely revolutionized how our society 
functions. Anything you could ever want, or need can be found 
online. This has made the Internet a logical tool for parents 
and teachers to help educate and entertain their children 
through online services and streaming platforms. Children born 
today will spend more time connected online than any other past 
generation.
    Companies use advanced data collecting techniques to gather 
and analyze the habits, movements, and interests to build at a 
virtual view that only exists to cater to advertisers.
    While I have spoken on this before, the impact this has on 
children can be even more detrimental. By taking advantage of 
the ``always on'' mentality, children are constantly being 
tracked and analyzed. Take TikTok, for example. They have been 
accused of using algorithms to keep kids scrolling 
indefinitely. Alphabet, Google and YouTube's parent company, 
has been accused of tracking children when they are not using 
their school devices and using features, such as auto play, to 
keep kids glued to their devices.
    But this does not end with tracking and scrolling. 
Companies like Snapchat have exposed children to predators and 
explicit adult content, while using their products. With 
millions of teen users, disappearing messages, and a map of all 
of your contacts, this has become a child predator's dream.
    Instagram, which Facebook owns, announced that they were 
going to create an Instagram for kids, but was immediately met 
with backlash from over 40 states, including Tennessee.
    As time moves forward, children will be at the forefront of 
technology, with each generation being more connected than the 
last. That is why it is so important that we get this right. We 
must ensure that children are not being taken advantage of and 
molded into something that they are not. Social media is 
causing our children to become more distressed than ever 
before. Do not take my word for it. Go talk to any 
pediatrician.
    Companies exploit children's desire to connect with their 
peers, utilizing behavioral design tools that are highly 
addictive. Young girls, in particular, are susceptible to body 
image issues and decreased self-esteem, from the distortions of 
reality present on many of these platforms.
    With so many children engaging in remote learning during 
this pandemic, it is more important that we remain vigilant, as 
parents and grandparents. We must not forget to focus on 
protecting their virtual you, as we work to craft comprehensive 
privacy legislation. Last Congress, Senators Wicker, Thune, 
Fischer, and I introduced the SAFE DATA Act, which contained a 
requirement that companies not transfer the data of individuals 
between the ages of 13 and 16, without the expressed consent of 
that individual, or of their parent or guardian.
    I am pleased to see continued engagement on this important 
topic, and I look forward to working with the members of this 
committee to craft legislation to help protect our precious 
children from Big Tech.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thanks, Senator Blackburn. I do not 
know whether Senators Cantwell or Wicker have any comments 
remotely. I guess not. I would like to now introduce the 
witnesses and we are very pleased to have you here today.

        STATEMENT OF ANGELA J. CAMPBELL, CHAIR, BOARD OF

         THE CAMPAIGN FOR A COMMERCIAL-FREE CHILDHOOD;

               PROFESSOR EMERITUS, GEORGETOWN LAW

    Ms. Campbell. Thank you. I want to thank Chairman 
Blumenthal, Ranking Member Blackburn, and the distinguished 
members of the Subcommittee, for inviting me here to testify 
about protecting children online. I am, as Senator Blumenthal 
said, Chairman of the Board for the Campaign for a Commercial-
Free Childhood, a leading watchdog of the children's media and 
marketing industries. Its advocacy is based on overwhelming 
evidence that child-targeted marketing and the excessive screen 
time it encourages, undermines kids? healthy development.
    CCFC led the charge in filing a complaint against YouTube 
for violating COPPA, that eventually led to the FTC's 2019 
settlement, which included a record fine of $170 million and it 
limited the collection and targeted advertising on child-
directed content on YouTube. Most recently, CCFC worked with a 
coalition of advocates and sent a letter to Facebook, urging 
them to drop their plans to offer Instagram for kids.
    My testimony also draws on my over 30 years' experience as 
the directing clinic at Georgetown, where we actually filed the 
very first complaint with the FTC ever, about a website that 
was targeting children, alleging that they were engaging in 
unfair and deceptive practices. And after a lot of hard work by 
many people, including then-Representative Ed Markey, Congress 
passed the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA. 
I am extremely proud of this accomplishment and I think it has 
provided significant protections for children, but it is badly 
in need of updating.
    In my written testimony, I address three issues, two of 
them I will leave for the questions. That is why children and 
teens need more protection against unfair and deceptive 
advertising practices online. And also, my suggestions about 
what the FTC could do to better protect children.
    So now, I will focus on why COPPA needs updating and how it 
should be updated. When COPPA was adopted in 1998, there was no 
YouTube, there was no social media, there were no smartphones, 
no smart speakers, and no Internet of things, including toys, 
connected to the internet. At that time, children's use of 
screens primarily consisted of watching broadcast or cable 
television. But today, as you have noted, they use digital 
media for education, entertainment, and socializing, and they 
spend many hours a day using these devices. And this time, of 
course, has only increased with the pandemic.
    As children and teens viewed--shifted their viewing from 
television to digital devices, marketing also became digital, 
and much more powerful. It uses incredibly sophisticated and 
elaborate systems to deliver targeted advertisements. The 
advertisers are able to track the users online, across multiple 
devices, combine that data with other data from other sources, 
and use very powerful algorithms and machine learning, to 
decide what--in real time, what ads an individual will see. 
This system allows kids to be profiled, for example, as gamers 
or impulsive purchasers or anxious over sharers, and then, 
targeted with ads designed to manipulate them to do more of 
those things.
    The dominant business model is for the platforms to keep 
the children engaged as long as possible, because then, that 
way, they will see more ads and the platforms can collect even 
more data about them. This unregulated business model harms 
young people, whose developing cognitive capabilities are no 
match for today's highly sophisticated digital marketing 
tactics.
    While it is profitable for the platforms, it means that 
young people are spending a lot of time online and they are 
often viewing things that may not be appropriate for them or, 
as you mentioned, getting--being solicited for inappropriate 
purposes. Time online has also been associated with a number of 
different problems, including depression and mental health, 
poor nutrition, insufficient sleep, problems in school, 
cyberbullying, online sexual abuse, risky behavior, and in some 
cases, even suicide.
    The COPPA rule that the FTC adopted and amended in 2013, 
generally prohibits targeting the profile of children under age 
13, unless parents having given notice about what data is 
collected, how it will be used, and with whom it will be 
shared, and have given advanced verifiable consent. However, 
the rules--these protections only apply in two situations. 
First, where a website or online services is directed at 
children. And second, where the operator has actual knowledge 
that it is collecting data from a child.
    Now, it is difficult to know whether or not a service is 
directed to children. And of course, children do not limit 
themselves to using only services directed at children. They 
use sites that are directed to mixed audiences or general 
audiences, as well. And so, when they are doing that, they are 
not covered by the protections, unless the company has actual 
knowledge. This actual knowledge standard is very problematic 
because it incentivizes operators to avoid complying with COPPA 
by saying--by not knowing, or pretending not to know, that 
children are using their platform.
    This is exactly what YouTube did until the FTC finally 
brought some enforcement action. Even though YouTube was, and 
is, the most popular online destination for children, Google 
insisted, for years, that YouTube had no COPPA obligations 
because its terms of service said the service was for 13 and 
above.
    Similarly, today, TikTok's terms of service says it is for 
only 13 and above and yet, it has internally classified one-
third of its users as younger than 14. And this is true even 
though they are already subject to this consent decree with the 
Federal Trade Commission, to make sure that they comply with 
COPPA.
    So, I think part of the problem with actual knowledge is, 
that it is really hard to prove. While in these two big cases, 
the FTC did conduct investigations and it did find actual 
knowledge, companies know that the FTC rarely initiates 
investigations. In fact, in 21 years, there have been 34 
enforcement actions brought by the FTC. And it is very 
difficult to prove actual knowledge. It is a subjective 
standard which has to examine what the relevant people knew 
when. It is information that is not public and there are many 
different parties involved in serving ads to kids. And many of 
these decisions are made by machines, by computers.
    So, it is important to replace the objective standard with 
constructive knowledge, which essentially means that the 
operator knew or should have known. It imposes a duty of 
reasonable care on the operators to determine whether they are 
collecting data from children. And I am very pleased that the 
Children and Teens Online Privacy Protection Act, which was 
introduced by Senators Markey and Cassidy, would replace actual 
knowledge with constructive knowledge. And it also makes clear 
what that means in the context of the digital ecosystem.
    Now, the other big problem with COPPA is that it only 
applies protections to children under age 13. Once a child 
turns 13, he or she is treated just like they were an adult. 
The teens are not developmentally the same as adults. They are 
still developing their capacities for self-regulation. They are 
wired to seek approval from their peers, and they lack the 
experience and judgment to assess risks and understand long-
term consequences.
    With teens spending, on average, seven and a half hours per 
day on social media, playing video games, and watching videos, 
this means they are developing their social and personal 
identities online. And apart from the harms that I have already 
mentioned, this data can be used--the data collected from all 
of these activities can be used to effect their future 
opportunities, such as, whether and where they go to college.
    The Children and Teens Online Privacy Protection Act, as 
well as the KIDS Act, which was introduced last session by 
Senators Markey and Blumenthal, would extend developmentally 
appropriate protections to minors, defined as ages 13 to 15. It 
would allow operators to collect personal data from minors, 
only if they adopt and follow a digital marketing bill of 
rights for minors, that is consistent with the fair information 
practices set forth in the legislation. It would also prohibit 
targeted marketing to minors, unless the minors were given 
sufficient notice and gave affirmative consent.
    So, I see that my time is about out and so, I will leave 
the other areas that I wanted to talk about, which is the need 
to apply protections against unfair and deceptive advertising, 
and other things that the FTC could do, to the questions. Thank 
you and I am happy--look forward to answering your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Campbell follows:]

Prepared Statement of Angela J. Campbell, Chair, Board of the Campaign 
  for a Commercial-Free Childhood; Professor Emeritus, Georgetown Law
    Chairman Blumenthal, Ranking Member Blackburn, and Distinguished 
Members of the Subcommittee: Thank you for inviting me to testify about 
protecting children online. I am pleased that the Subcommittee is 
focusing on the important issues of children's online privacy and 
manipulative marketing to children.
    I am here in my role as the Chair of the Board of the Campaign for 
a Commercial-Free Childhood. CCFC is the leading watchdog of the 
children's media and marketing industries. CCFC's advocacy is grounded 
in the overwhelming evidence that child-targeted marketing--and the 
excessive screen time it encourages--undermines kids' healthy 
development. Through corporate campaigns and strategic legal filings, 
CCFC has changed the child-targeted marketing and data collection 
practices of some of the world's biggest companies. Most notably, 
CCFC's 2018 complaint filed with the FTC against YouTube ultimately led 
to the 2019 FTC settlement that required YouTube to pay a record fine 
and to limit data collection and targeted advertising on child-directed 
content. CCFC is currently leading a large coalition of parents, 
advocates and child development experts urging Facebook to abandon its 
plans for a kids' version of Instagram.\1\
    My testimony also draws on my over 30 years as the director of a 
clinical program at Georgetown Law that represents nonprofit 
organizations, including CCFC and the Center for Digital Democracy, 
advocating for media policies in the public interest. In this capacity, 
I supervised the drafting of numerous comments and requests for 
investigation filed with the FTC concerning children's advertising and 
privacy.\2\ In 1996, the clinic filed the first complaint alleging that 
a website directed to children was engaging in unfair and deceptive 
practices. This complaint that focused attention on the need to protect 
children's online privacy, and with much hard work by many people 
including then-Representative Markey, Congress passed the Children's 
Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in 1998. I am extremely proud of 
this accomplishment and the important safeguards COPPA has provided for 
children. Today, however, COPPA badly needs updating.
    In this testimony I addresses three issues. First, I will discuss 
why it is urgent to update COPPA and the key areas where the current 
protections have fallen short. Next, I will explain why we need greater 
protections for children and teens against unfair and deceptive 
advertising practices online. Finally, I offer suggestions about how 
the FTC could better protect children.
I. New privacy legislation is needed to protect children and teens
    When COPPA was adopted in 1998, there was no YouTube, no social 
media, no smartphones, no smart speakers in children's bedrooms, and no 
toys connected to the internet. Today, children and adolescents 
increasingly use digital media for education, entertainment, and 
socializing. Prior to the pandemic, research by Common Sense found 
children in the U.S. from birth to age 8 consumed an average of two and 
a half hours of screen media a day, while 8- to 12-year-olds averaged 
just under five day, and teens averaged about seven and a half hours--
and these figures do not include use for school or homework.\3\ The 
pandemic has accelerated these trends, with studies reporting screen 
time up as much as 50 percent.\4\
    Moreover, over the last twenty years, an incredibly sophisticated 
and elaborate digital marketing ecosystem has developed. The boundaries 
between programming and marketing have completely eroded so that even 
discerning adults have difficulty identifying what is sponsored 
content. In addition, no longer do viewers of the same content see the 
same ads, as they did with traditional television and print 
advertising. Marketing has become personalized to appeal to the 
particular interests of individuals. This type of marketing, often 
called targeted or behavioral advertising, is made possible by tracking 
users' online activity across multiple devices, combining data from 
multiple sources, and using algorithms and machine learning to make 
inferences about what users want or are likely to respond to.
    Targeted marketing makes it harder for parents to monitor what 
their children are seeing. Moreover, most Americans are not aware of 
the extent of data collected online and how it can be used to 
manipulate them. Because the problems are system-wide, there is little 
parents can do on their own to protect their children. Thus, regulatory 
intervention is urgently needed. I am pleased that the subcommittee is 
considering legislation to better protect children.
A. The unregulated system of digital media is harmful to children
    The largely unregulated business model for digital media subjects 
young people to three types of interrelated harms.
    First, a large body of research demonstrates that children's and 
adolescent's developing cognitive capacities are no match for today's 
highly sophisticated digital marketing tactics, which leverage enormous 
data sets, machine learning, and the most powerful persuasive 
technologies ever created, to deliver in real time an advertisement 
that a young person is most vulnerable to at a given moment. As Common 
Sense notes, ``Kids may be profiled as gamers, impulsive purchasers, or 
anxious oversharers--and then unfairly targeted by ads that encourage 
more of these things.'' \5\
    These concerns are not theoretical. In 2017, leaked documents 
revealed that Facebook boasted to advertisers that it could target 
teens at the exact moment they were feeling bad about themselves, 
including when they have negative thoughts about their bodies.\6\ This 
year, advocates were able buy Facebook ads targeted to teens who are 
interested in alcohol, gambling and extreme weight loss.\7\ Not 
surprisingly, given both the inherent unfairness of personalized 
marketing to children and the fact that kids and teens are often 
targeted with ads for harmful products, marketing is a factor in many 
of the most pressing problems facing children today, including 
childhood obesity, body image issues, a rise in materialistic values 
and family conflict.
    A second harm is that the vast amount of data collected from young 
people is used to deliver the personalized content that is most likely 
to keep them on a platform. While maximizing engagement generates 
profits for platforms, the overuse of digital media it encourages is 
particularly harmful to young people. It has been associated with, 
among other things, depression and mental health problems, poor 
nutrition, problems in school, cyberbullying, insufficient sleep, and 
online sexual abuse.
    Finally, spending so much time using digital devices exposes young 
people to harmful and inappropriate content. The platforms want young 
people to stay online as long as possible because it increases their 
profits. They use algorithms to recommend the content that is most 
likely to keep kids engaged, regardless of whether that content is 
educational, age-appropriate or promotes prosocial behavior. As a 
former YouTube engineer explains, ``Recommendations are designed to 
optimize watch time, there is no reason that it shows content that is 
actually good for kids.'' \8\
B. In practice, COPPA's actual knowledge standard permits the 
        collection of personal information from children and is 
        difficult to apply
    COPPA needs to be amended to address these harms. Experience over 
the last twenty years has shown that a significant weakness of COPPA is 
that its protections apply only to websites and online services that 
are considered directed to children, or where the operator has actual 
knowledge that a child or children under thirteen is using their site 
or service. Yet many sites and services directed to mixed and general 
audiences are nonetheless used by many children.
    COPPA's actual knowledge standard creates a giant loophole that 
undermines children's safety. It incentivizes platforms to avoid COPPA 
compliance by not knowing--or pretending not to know--that children 
under thirteen are using their platforms. For example, even though 
YouTube is the most popular online destination for children, Google 
insisted for years that YouTube had no COPPA obligations because the 
platform's Terms of Service said it was for ages thirteen and up. 
Similarly, TikTok continues to claim it lacks actual knowledge of 
accounts belonging to children under thirteen--despite that fact that 
TikTok has used machine learning to classify one-third of its users as 
younger than fourteen.\9\
    While YouTube and TikTok clearly had actual knowledge of children 
using their platforms, the FTC had to conduct investigations to prove 
it. Companies know that the FTC rarely initiates investigations. 
Moreover, even when the FTC investigates, it can be difficult to prove 
``actual knowledge.'' A single child-directed app, for example, may be 
sending a child's personal information to dozens of firms that engage 
in targeted advertising, monetization and analysis.\10\ Because of the 
many parties involved in online data collection and marketing and 
because many decisions are made by algorithms rather than humans, the 
actual knowledge standard, which requires the FTC to show what 
operators actually know, is unworkable.
    The Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act, introduced 
by Senators Markey and Cassidy, would close this loophole in COPPA by 
making an operator liable if it has ``constructive knowledge that 
personal information is being collected from a child or minor.'' 
``Constructive knowledge'' is an often-used legal concept that 
generally means that one ``knew or should have known.'' Constructive 
knowledge is an objective standard, and it relies on facts 
ascertainable by the FTC and the public and can be determined without 
needing to know what the party in question was actually aware of or 
intending to do. A constructive knowledge standard would impose a 
reasonable duty of care on operators to determine whether they are 
collecting data from children, and if so, provide appropriate 
safeguards.
C. COPPA lacks any protections for adolescents
    Another huge loophole in COPPA is that it only applies for children 
under age 13. Once a child turns 13, he or she is treated the same as 
an adult. I am not aware of any other legal context in which thirteen-
year-olds are treated as adults. Increasingly, the US' lack of 
protections for teens puts it at odds with the trend in Europe and 
elsewhere to offer special data protections for young people until they 
turn at least 16, and in some cases, up to 18. More than 90 percent of 
U.S. parents believe COPPA's protections for children should be 
expanded to teens.
    Teens are vulnerable online for different reasons than younger 
children. Not only do they spend more time online, but adolescence is 
the period of personal and social identity formation. Much of this 
development is now reliant on social media. Because teens have a 
limited capacity for self-regulation compared to adults and are 
vulnerable to peer pressure, they often find it difficult to identify 
and respond appropriately to online risks. Excessive social media use 
by teens has been associated with a wide variety of public health 
issues including depression and mental disorders, exposure to unwanted 
to explicit content, harassment, sexual solicitation, bullying, self-
harm, and even suicide.
    The Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act, as well as 
the KIDS Act, which I discuss below, would extend developmentally-
appropriate protections to minors, defined as ages 13 to 15. 
Specifically, it would prohibit operators from collecting personal data 
from minors unless the operator adopts and follows a Digital Marketing 
Bill of Rights for Minors that is consistent with the Fair Information 
Practices Principles set forth in Section 4 of the bill. It would 
prohibit targeted advertising to minors unless the minor is given 
notice and gives affirmative consent. Minors would also have the right 
to delete personal information displayed on a website, online service, 
and online or mobile apps, which they had submitted.
D. Targeted advertising to children should not be permitted
    COPPA currently allows parents, after receiving appropriate notice 
and granting affirmative verifiable consent, to permit the collection 
of a child's data for the purposes identified in the notice. The FTC's 
COPPA Rule as amended in 2013 prohibits targeted advertising to and 
profiling of children absent parental notice and consent. However, in 
practice, targeted advertising to children remains widespread.
    As described above, the harms from targeted advertising--both from 
the ads themselves and the ways behavioral advertising shape children's 
online experiences--are serious enough that Congress should explicitly 
prohibit the practice when aimed at children. The Children and Teens' 
Online Privacy Protection Act would do just that by making it unlawful 
for operators to use, disclose, or compile children's personal 
information for the purposes of targeted marketing.
    I hope that the subcommittee will quickly adopt these important 
revisions to COPPA as set forth in the in Children and Teens' Online 
Privacy Protection Act.
II. Legislation is needed to prevent unfair and deceptive marketing to 
        children and teens
    I hope that the subcommittee will also consider legislation similar 
to the KIDS Act (S. 3411) introduced by Senators Markey and Blumenthal 
in the last session. The KIDS Act would offer children protections from 
unfair and deceptive marketing on online platforms, similar to those 
that currently exist for television and discourage certain other 
practices harmful for children.
    It has been understood since the mid-1970s that children are more 
vulnerable to advertising than adults. Research on television 
advertising has consistently found that children under the age of 8 
have difficulty understanding advertising's persuasive intent and it is 
not until around age 12 that children begin to understand that 
advertising is designed to change their behavior. When advertising is 
embedded in programming--which is often the case on the Internet--
children's and teens ability to even identify advertising, let alone 
think critically about it, is likely to emerge even later.\11\ More 
than 90 percent of U.S. parents believe COPPA's protections for 
children should be expanded to teens.\12\
    For this reason, the Federal Communications Commission has long 
required restrictions on advertising on children's television 
programming to help mitigate young people's vulnerabilities to 
marketing. These include a clear separation between program content and 
advertising, a prohibition of the use of certain unfair and deceptive 
advertising methods such as host selling and embedded advertising, and 
limits on the total amount of advertising that can be shown.
    Over the years, however, children's viewing behavior has changed. 
They are watching less traditional broadcast and cable television and 
spending more time online watching online videos, playing Internet and 
mobile games, and interacting on social media. Unfortunately, there is 
no equivalent to the FCC policies for children's television on the 
internet.
    As a result, much of the content that children and teens view 
online today is marketing. In addition to pop-up and banner ads, 
marketing is embedded into content in such a way that children don't 
recognize that they are being marketed to. And that is the point. 
Children and teens say they don't like advertising, and embedded 
content can't be blocked by ad blockers. Thus, covert advertising is 
more effective than traditional forms of advertising.
    Covert advertising occurs in many forms and is known by different 
names such as influencer marketing, native advertising, product 
placements, and unboxing videos. Influencer marketing, for example, 
takes place when brands pay or reward social media influencers for 
promoting their products online.
    Influencer marketing is a huge business.\13\ It is prevalent on 
virtually all digital media platforms, and popular influencers often 
appear on multiple platforms. Social media influencers are extremely 
popular with children and teens. Many influencers are under age 18, and 
some are much younger. During the week of May 3, 2021, for example, 3 
of the top-5 most viewed US-based YouTube channels featured child 
influencers in videos directed to children. For example, the second-
ranked Kids Diana Show was viewed 379.5 million times.\14\ This channel 
features 7-year old Diana promoting the ``Love Diana'' lifestyle 
product line, which includes dolls, hair accessories, jewelry, and 
beauty products. These videos are available on both YouTube and YouTube 
Kids despite Google's claims that they do not allow product placement 
on the YouTube Kids app. One-third of children under the age of eight 
regularly watch ``unboxing'' or ``product demonstration'' videos,\15\ 
where influencers talk excitedly about toys or other products they have 
be compensated to promote. These videos which often run more than 10-
minutes in length are essentially one long ad. Research has found that 
children are more likely to nag their parents for products--and to 
throw a tantrum if they say ``no''--after watching unboxing videos than 
after watching traditional television commercials.\16\
    In addition to YouTube, other sites popular with children and teens 
are rife with influencer marketing. On TikTok, well-known brands 
including Doritos, Burger King, KoolAid and McDonalds, have sponsored 
TikTok Hashtag Challenges in which users create and upload promotions 
for their brand. On Instagram, one-third of the most viewed Stories 
came from brands. An investigation by Public Citizen found that many 
Instagram influencers popular with young were promoting alcohol, 
cosmetics, and clothing without disclosing they were compensated for 
their posts.\17\ TikTok and Instagram are among the most popular social 
media sites with teens and, despite Terms of Service that their sites 
are for thirteen and up, they are also used by millions of younger 
children.
    In short, regardless of platform, much of the digital content seen 
by children and teens is marketing products to them in a way that is 
inherently misleading and unfair. Children deserve the same protections 
from unfair and manipulative marketing regardless of whether they are 
consuming media on television, a computer, tablet, or mobile phone. 
Passage of the KIDS Act would apply the traditional protections for 
kids against covert, unfair and manipulative advertising to the media 
that young people use today.
    The KIDS Act would also address some other harms to children made 
possible by digital media. For example, it would prohibit certain 
``nudging'' practices, such as autoplay, automatic notifications, and 
rewards, that make it hard for children to stop using their devices 
even when it is in their best interest to do so. And in spending so 
much time online, children are often exposed to inappropriate content, 
disinformation, bullying, risky behavior, and sexual exploitation.
III. The FTC should do more to protect children
    Congress could also help protect children by giving the FTC the 
encouragement and resources that it needs to do its job. The Children 
and Teen Online Privacy Act, for instance, would create a much-needed 
Division of Youth Privacy and Marketing within the FTC.
    I am pleased that in 2020, the FTC initiated an investigation under 
its Section 6(b) authority that will allow it to better understand the 
digital advertising ecosystem and how it affects children.\18\ This 
investigation should provide invaluable information for the FTC to 
assess and improve its existing rules. I also hope that the FTC will 
share its findings with the public so that it can better understand how 
personal data is collected and used. In the meantime, it is important 
that the FTC vigorously enforce its existing policies to protect 
children.
A. The FTC should bring enforcement actions to prevent unfair and 
        deceptive 
        marketing to children and teens
    Under its Section 5 authority to prevent unfair and deceptive acts 
or practices, the FTC has long issued guidance to advertisers regarding 
endorsements. The Endorsement Guide generally states that product 
endorsements must not be deceptive, meaning that the endorsements must 
be truthful, and any sponsorships must be clearly disclosed to 
consumers. The FTC has already revised the Enforcement Guide to make 
clear that these requirements apply when advertisers provide financial 
or other incentives for social media influencers to promote their 
products online.\19\ Yet, the FTC has brought few enforcement actions 
for online advertising and none involving social media influencers 
targeted to those most vulnerable, that is, children. This is the case, 
despite that fact that in 2015, the Georgetown clinic, acting on behalf 
of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and Center for Digital 
Democracy, documented numerous videos shown on YouTube Kids in which 
kid influencers promoted toys and unhealthy food and beverages, and 
asked the FTC to investigate whether this marketing was unfair or 
deceptive.\20\
    While influencer advertising often fails to disclose its 
sponsorships, even when provided, disclosure does not prevent children 
from being misled or taken unfair advantage of. Often, disclosures are 
made in ways children can't understand: for example, a small written 
disclosure appears in the corner of the screen of an unboxing video 
aimed at preliterate children.\21\ But even when sponsorships are 
disclosed orally in child-friendly language, they are ineffective for 
young children because they view the child influencers or product 
spokes-characters online as their friends. Last year, the FTC took a 
positive step by asking in its endorsement guide review whether 
children are capable of understanding these disclosures. Research 
clearly shows that children do not.
    In sum, the FTC can and should bring enforcement actions against 
both high-profile influencers that target children, as well as the 
companies that use influencers to manipulate young people. It should 
also update the endorsement guidelines to state clearly that unboxing 
videos and other form of influencer marketing aimed at children is 
unfair and deceptive regardless of whether sponsorship is disclosed.
B. The FTC should vigorously enforce the COPPA Rule
    The FTC should also enforce the existing COPPA Rule more 
vigorously. Noncompliance with COPPA is rampant. For instance, studies 
by Professor Serge Engelman found that thousands of children's apps in 
the Designed for Families section of the Google Play Store were sharing 
children's personal information with third parties without getting 
verified parental consent as required by COPPA. The CCFC and others 
cited this study in a petition asking the FTC to investigate whether 
Google Play violated Section 5 of the FTC Act by claiming that these 
apps were appropriate for children when they did not comply with 
COPPA.\22\ Yet again, the FTC did nothing.
    In fact, in the 21 years that the COPPA Rule has been in effect, 
the FTC has brought only 34 enforcement actions, mostly against smaller 
companies. All were settled without litigation by consent decrees. 
Often, settlements merely required the defendant to comply with the law 
and file periodic reports with the FTC. When the FTC has assessed civil 
penalties, they have been woefully insufficient to incentivize 
compliance with COPPA.
    To change an ecosystem where noncompliance with a law designed to 
protect children's is the norm, the FTC must engage in much more 
rigorous enforcement action. The Commission should both bring more 
COPPA cases and seek much stiffer penalties so it is no longer in 
companies' interest to ignore the law.
C. The FTC should hold safe harbors accountable
    The FTC has also failed to use the enforcement tools available to 
it in an effective manner. For example, Section 6502 of COPPA 
established a ``safe harbor'' regime intended to incentivize compliance 
with COPPA. Under this provision, third parties can design a compliance 
program that meets or exceeds the COPPA protections, apply to the FTC 
for approval, and if approved, the FTC will deem members that follow 
the approved guidelines to have complied with COPPA.
    Unfortunately, as analysis by both Commissioner Chopra and 
Professor Egelman shows, COPPA safe harbor programs are not enforcing 
their guidelines. Instead of incentivizing compliance, safe harbors 
appear to provide a way for companies to avoid complying simply by 
paying a safe harbor to certify them. Either the FTC should take steps 
to ensure that COPPA safe harbors programs are kept up to date and 
enforced, or it should revoke their approval.\23\
IV. Conclusion
    The largely unregulated monetization practices of digital media are 
both unfair and harmful to young people. Congress could take huge 
strides towards creating a healthier media environment for children and 
teens by expanding COPPA's protections to teens and closing some of its 
loopholes such as the actual knowledge standard. Congress could also 
protect children from unfair and deceptive marketing and many of the 
most pernicious design features in digital media by passing the KIDS 
Act or similar legislation.
    I appreciate this opportunity to present these recommendations to 
the Committee on behalf of CCFC and am happy to answer any questions.

          STATEMENT OF SERGE EGELMAN, Ph.D., RESEARCH

          DIRECTOR, USABLE SECURITY AND PRIVACY GROUP,

           INTERNATIONAL COMPUTER SCIENCE INSTITUTE;

               CTO AND CO-FOUNDER APPCENSUS, INC.

    Mr. Egelman. Chairman Blumenthal, Ranking Member Blackburn, 
and distinguished members of this Subcommittee, it is an honor 
to be here today. Thanks for inviting me.
    My name is Serge Egelman, and I direct the Usable Security 
and Privacy group at the International Computer Science 
Institute, which is a research institute affiliated with UC, 
Berkeley. I am also the CTO and co-founder of AppCensus, which 
is a startup that does privacy analysis of mobile apps.
    As background, I have been studying consumer privacy online 
for almost 20 years now. And actually, over the past 10 years, 
my research group has focused on mobile apps. And in fact, 2 
years ago, and likely the reason I was asked to testify today, 
was because my lab published a paper where we studied 
children's apps, specifically. And so, what we did was, we went 
to the Google Play Store and basically just downloaded as many 
kids' Android apps as we could. I am picking on Android just 
because Android is open source and so, we had to write, you 
know, pretty sophisticated instrumentation into the operating 
system itself, so that we can monitor exactly what data apps 
try and access and then, to whom they send it.
    Using this instrumentation, we ran almost 6,000 different 
apps, all, again, targeted at children, self-selected by the 
developers. When they post those apps into the app stores, it 
is the app developer who says, you know, this is a child 
directed app. You know, please list it in the kids' category. 
And so, given that, that they should all be covered by COPPA.
    What we found was that more than half of them had 
indications that they were likely violating COPPA. So, to give 
you some examples, about 5 percent of the apps that we looked 
at transmitted outright contact info like, you know, names, 
addresses, e-mail addresses, and location data. So, 1 in 20 
apps, those are the types of cases that the FTC, you know, has 
successfully prosecuted in the past.
    Forty percent of the apps were transmitting other types of 
personal information, such as, persistent identifiers, which 
are used--that is what enables all of this tracking. And I am 
happy to go into details during questions about how persistent 
identifiers are used, if you want follow up on that.
    Another forty percent of the apps--these are non-mutually 
exclusive--basically, render the user controllable privacy 
settings useless. So, on Android and iOS, both Apple and Google 
offer user controllable settings where you can opt out of 
tracking. And the way that that works is that, when the user 
chooses to opt out of tracking, what should happen is that the 
operating system prevents the apps from accessing, you know, 
the user resettable identifiers. Or it allows the user to reset 
those identifiers in much the same way that a user might clear 
their cookies from the web browser. The problem is, if they are 
collected alongside other identifiers, that basically renders 
that functionality useless. And so, we saw that happening in 
about 40 percent of the cases.
    And then also, you know, to be clear, most of these 
potential violations that we observed were due to third-party 
data transfers. So, the apps themselves had, you know, all of 
these other components. It is very common, in software 
engineering, to have, you know, third-party components, similar 
to, you know, other branches of engineering.
    So, for instance, a car manufacturer, you know, usually 
does not make 100 percent of the parts in a car themselves. 
With software developers will put, you know, prepackaged 
components in. And the problem comes when those components 
either are misconfigured by the developer to inadvertently 
enable tracking of children, despite COPPA-compliant settings 
that the directors are instructed to use, if the apps that 
those third-party components are bundled in, are directed to 
kids. They are supposed to set these settings and that was not 
happening.
    But also, in 20 percent of the apps that we examined, they 
were sending data to third-parties, whose terms of service 
explicitly said, ``We do not knowingly receive data from 
children and, therefore, please do not use our components in 
child-directed apps''. Nonetheless, you know, one in five apps 
appeared to be violating that. And you might wonder why the 
terms of service has this prohibition. That is because, if you 
read the privacy policy, you know, for most of these services, 
they make it pretty clear that the data that is being collected 
is going to be used for profiling purposes or behavioral ad 
targeting.
    We also found as many Safe Harbor certified apps as we 
could. So, under COPPA, the FTC has blessed seven organizations 
as Safe Harbor certifiers. And so, an app developer, or other 
online service provider, can go to one of these seven services 
and once, you know, they submit, you know, their product and 
fill out a questionnaire, the certifier deems the app COPPA 
compliant and that indemnifies them from FTC action.
    So, looking at the Safe Harbor certified apps, we found 
that they were not appreciably better, in terms of COPPA 
compliance. And you know, just looking at the raw numbers, they 
actually appeared to be worse. And that is actually--there is a 
lot of economics literature on adverse selection with these 
types of self-regulation programs where it is, you know, the 
worst actors who have the incentives to participate. You know, 
the, you know, actors who are already complying with the law, 
why would they pay money to get certified, you know, to be, you 
know, against enforcement actions?
    So, based on this research, I have four recommendations for 
improving COPPA. So, one is, you know, the actual versus 
constructive knowledge standard, and Professor Campbell talked 
a lot about that. I can go into detail during questions about 
some of the issues there.
    The other problem is the internal operations exemption. So, 
under COPPA, there is an exemption for collecting, again, the 
persistent identifiers that enable the tracking ecosystem, if 
they are collected for internal operations purposes. Which is 
not exactly defined by statute--in the statute. The FTC in the 
last round of rulemaking--I think that was in 2013, had added a 
bunch of categories. The problem is, all of those categories, 
under internal operations, do not strictly require personal 
information, you know, to--you know, for those uses. And so, 
that is why this exemption is kind of moot.
    Also, for another reason which is by policy, on the major 
platforms, both, you know, Google and Apple, they require--
Apple for kids apps does not allow developers to collect 
identifiers, period, for tracking purposes. And so, there is no 
internal operations exemption that I am aware of, for the Apple 
platform, if you are an iOS developer. Google has similar 
policies where collecting persistent identifiers from users 
requires consent, in many cases. And again, you know, that is 
why the internal operations exemption, based on my research, it 
seems to be abused a lot by app developers, partially because 
they probably do not understand what it means, either. And so, 
that is why I think that should be eliminated.
    The third and fourth thing are related. So, increasing 
enforcement actions, I have some ideas there. The FTC does 
excellent work. There are some very smart people there that 
understand these issues. They are just overburdened. They have, 
you know, a lot of things on their plate, if they get a lot of 
complaints to investigate and they just do not have the 
resources to investigate them all.
    And so, finally, you know, in parallel with that, I have 
some ideas for fixing some of these Safe Harbor programs. One 
is that it is not clear what they actually do. So, I think, one 
regulatory update--or I guess, something that the FTC could do 
through regulation, is set standards and have invited privacy 
experts to comment and--you know, on the proposed standards 
that those Safe Harbors should have to follow.
    But then, two, the other issue is, my research team had a 
very hard time identifying what was and was not certified by 
any of these programs. Many of the apps that we looked at had 
privacy policies that said they are certified by these 
programs. Many of the certification organizations had the names 
of apps on their websites. When the paper was published, many 
of these organizations said, oh, they have no idea. That it is 
not actually certified by us, despite the name of the app still 
appearing on their website for months after, you know, making 
those public statements.
    And so, there is clearly a--you know, I am not going to go 
and say, you know, bad faith, but there is clearly a lot of 
consumer confusion here. And so, I think, one fix there is just 
mandating that every Safe Harbor organization should have to 
publicly post what apps are actually certified and what 
versions of those apps. Because any time the software is 
updated, the privacy behaviors could change and it might--you 
know, suddenly a software update occurs and now the app is 
doing something that would violate COPPA, but it has been 
indemnified due to the Safe Harbor. And so, that is a situation 
that I think needs to be addressed. And I will leave it at 
that.

1 Introduction and Summary
    Chairman Blumenthal, Ranking Member Blackburn, and Distinguished 
Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify 
today about children's online privacy and the mobile app ecosystem.
    My name is Serge Egelman, and I direct the Usable Security and 
Privacy research group at the International Computer Science Institute, 
which is a research institute affiliated with the University of 
California, Berkeley.\1\ I hold a PhD from Carnegie Mellon University's 
School of Computer Science and a BS in computer engineering from the 
University of Virginia. I am also the CTO and co-founder of AppCensus, 
which is a startup that builds tools to analyze the privacy behaviors 
of mobile apps.\2\ I also consult for state and Federal regulators on 
issues pertaining to online consumer privacy and security.

    For the past 17 years, I have been studying consumer privacy 
preferences, how they make online privacy decisions, and how the online 
ecosystem can be better designed to both protect consumers and help 
them make more informed decisions. For the past 10 years, I have 
studied privacy in the mobile app space, including examining what 
personal information mobile apps are collecting and sharing, and how 
that might contrast with consumer expectations, laws, and platform 
policies. Most relevant to the Subcommittee, two years ago my research 
group published a study of mobile apps' compliance with the Children's 
Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We used our tools to test 5,855 
Android apps that were directed to children and found that more than 
half appeared to be violating COPPA [3].
    My goal through this testimony is to explain how online tracking 
works, my re-search on COPPA violations in the mobile app ecosystem, 
and how the law can be updated to keep pace with rapid technological 
change to better protect children online. Based on this research, I 
offer four specific recommendations for improving COPPA:

   Moving from an ``actual'' to ``constructive'' knowledge 
        standard

   Eliminating the internal operations exemption

   Fixing the Safe Harbor program

   Increasing enforcement
2 Background on Mobile Tracking
    To monetize many online services, companies pay those services to 
show specific advertisements to specific users. They do this by 
inferring individual users' preferences based on data automatically 
collected from them: the services they use, how they use them, from 
where they use them, and so forth. In short, online and offline 
activities are tracked, which allows companies to maintain detailed 
profiles of individual user behavior, which in turn is used to predict 
users' interests, preferences, and even demographics. The collected 
information may be used to predict a consumer's religion, health 
conditions, sexual orientation, or political affiliation; some of this 
information may be revealed by the phone's GPS location alone, or even 
by just the name of the app that is being used.
    In most cases, this data is used to target advertisements, but in 
some cases it is sold to data brokers, who use it to augment profiles 
of the same consumers that they collected from other sources, and then 
sell it to whoever is willing to pay for it. Obviously, this is even 
more concerning when the data comes from children, who are unlikely to 
understand that this is happening, much less consent to it, but who 
could potentially face enormous impacts due to future usage of this 
data. This data may be used for manipulative marketing campaigns, but 
also may feed biased and unaccountable algorithms that use it to make 
decisions about a child's future, not to mention outright malicious 
uses of the data.
    Contrary to popular belief, the reason why you receive oddly 
prescient ads is not because your devices are secretly recording your 
conversations, but because of this type of inference: your online and 
offline activities are tracked, and then sophisticated algorithms use 
that data to make predictions about you. Tracking is made possible by 
``persistent identifiers.'' An identifier is any piece of information 
that allows an individual--or device--to be uniquely identified. 
``Persistent'' identifiers are identifiers that tend to not change over 
time. For example, motor vehicles have persistent identifiers in the 
form of license plates: a license plate uniquely identifies a vehicle 
and vehicles tend to have the same license plates over time. Thus, if 
someone records all the license plates at a particular place over time, 
they can determine how many times in that period any individual vehicle 
was there. Similarly, if license plates are recorded at many different 
locations and that data is combined into a single dataset, one could 
use that to reconstruct the movements of individual vehicles in that 
dataset. As can be seen, combining a persistent identifier with 
information about where that identifier was observed allows a data 
recipient to reconstruct an individual's activities. Using this 
knowledge, one could infer information about their routines, 
preferences, demographics, and even relations and social connections!
    While this type of mass surveillance may seem appealing to some for 
the increased security they believe it may enable, a wealth of 
scholarship exists to show why this is a false tradeoff (e.g., [4, 5]).
    This is precisely how mobile tracking occurs. Mobile phones have 
various identifiers associated with them, including some that cannot be 
easily changed (e.g., serial number, WiFi MAC address, IMEI, etc.). As 
mobile phones are very personal devices, a unique identifier for a 
mobile phone is consequently a unique identifier for that individual 
and can therefore be used to collect data about their activities, 
preferences, and demographics, simply based on data collection that 
associates it with the apps that were used, when, how, and where.
    Why does this matter? By and large, this data is used for 
advertising purposes: these profiles are used to decide which ads to 
show which users, allowing advertisers to target individuals based on 
their inferred interests and preferences. However, the data is 
increasingly used for other purposes that are often completely opaque 
to consumers, particularly parents. For example, location data 
collected by apps is frequently resold to other businesses and used for 
everything from predicting social relations in the physical world, to 
predicting retail sales trends, for law enforcement surveillance, and 
even for political fundraising and advocacy. This data is being 
collected without consumers' knowledge, and then is misused in ways 
that undermine individual rights. Worse, new uses for this type of data 
are invented all the time, which means that there's no way of knowing 
exactly how collected data may be used in the future. Data collected 
from mobile apps and other services could end up being used for making 
major life decisions, such as whether offers of credit or employment 
are extended, or whether someone is admitted to a particular school, or 
even the type of medical care that they may receive. When this data 
comes from children, it is obviously even more concerning.
3 Research Findings
    As part of prior research to study how mobile apps' privacy 
practices comport with consumers' expectations, my lab wrote bespoke 
instrumentation for the Android platform that allows us to run mobile 
apps and monitor exactly what personal data those apps access and to 
whom they transmit it [6, 7, 8, 2]. We wrote our tools for Google's 
Android platform only because it is open source: having the source code 
for the operating system allowed us to modify it for this purpose; at 
the time, we didn't look at Apple's iOS simply because we didn't have 
the source code to add the same level of instrumentation.
    Starting in late 2016, we began downloading as many free apps in 
the ``Designed for Families'' (DFF) program as we could find, which 
ended up being just under 6,000 apps [3]. The DFF program is a section 
of the Play Store, Google's centralized Android app market, which is 
exclusively for apps that are directed to children. Mobile app 
developers must participate in the program when they upload their app 
and disclose to Google that it is directed at children. As part of the 
program, they must affirm to Google that their app is in compliance 
with COPPA. Our goal was to evaluate whether that was the case in 
practice.
3.1 Collection of Contact and Location Information
    In terms of the most serious privacy violations, we observed that 
roughly 300 of the apps that we tested (4.8 percent) were collecting 
children's contact information (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, and 
phone numbers) and/or precise location data, which included apps 
specifically targeted at children under 5. In most cases, this data was 
transmitted to third-party advertising companies, or third parties that 
otherwise support the advertising industry. I believe that this is a 
serious finding that should be put in perspective: roughly 1 in 20 of 
the apps that we examined were collecting information without the 
requisite verifiable parental consent, and for which the FTC has 
previously brought cases.
3.2 Insecure Transfer of Personal Information
    The most common issue that we observed was the transmission of 
personal data using insecure means. Under COPPA, covered services are 
required to ``establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect 
the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information 
collected from children.'' \3\ While neither the statute nor 
regulations define what are considered ``reasonable procedures,'' 
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor have been industry 
standards for more than three decades now; its use is required on U.S. 
government websites.\4\ Simply put, it is not considered ``reasonable'' 
to transmit personal information without the use of TLS to secure it. 
Nonetheless, we observed that 40 percent of the children's apps (2,344 
apps) we tested failed to take this reasonable procedure.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    What this means is that for users of these apps, their personal 
information is accessible to any eavesdroppers. This may include anyone 
sharing the same WiFi connection, as well as Internet service providers 
and other organizations. In an extreme case, this could enable someone 
to identify a specific child within a specific area, based on the 
insecure transmissions emanating from that child's device.
3.3 Targeted Advertising
    The remaining pervasive privacy issues that we discovered had to do 
with the collection of persistent identifiers. A persistent identifier 
is simply a label that is unique to an individual, such as a Social 
Security Number or the serial number of a personal device. While a 
persistent identifier might appear as an insignificant random number or 
combination of letters, as I explained, persistent identifiers are 
primarily what enable targeted advertising and other types of data 
collection. We identified multiple issues, including: (1) Google's user 
privacy settings may fail to work due lack of policy enforcement and 
(2) many app developers fail to correctly configure third-party 
software components to limit data collection from children, resulting 
in children's personal information being sent to third parties for 
targeted advertising and other purposes.
3.3.1 Ineffective Android Privacy Settings
    Prior to 2013, mobile apps for both Google's Android and Apple's 
iOS mobile operating systems collected a variety of different non-
resettable identifiers that were used to track consumers. Unlike 
cookies in the web browser, which can be periodically cleared by the 
user, many of these identifiers cannot be reset, and so mobile device 
users had neither transparency into who was tracking them nor when they 
were being tracked, nor any control over it. In response, both Apple 
and Google created software-based ``advertising identifiers'' that 
could be reset through user-facing privacy controls. By policy, both 
platforms mandate that only these identifiers be used to track users, 
in lieu of other non-resettable identifiers. This is so that a consumer 
can opt out of tracking via the provided settings interface. However, 
as we discovered on Android, compliance with this policy is not 
enforced by Google: app developers and the third-party mobile SDKs 
embedded within their apps are able to collect other non-resettable 
identifiers alongside the advertising ID. When this happens, if a 
consumer resets their advertising ID or uses the privacy settings 
interface to opt out of tracking altogether, data recipients are simply 
on their honor to stop tracking that consumer.
    We observed that 39 percent of the children's apps that we tested 
transmitted non-resettable identifiers alongside the user-resettable 
advertising ID. What this means is that for users of these 2,281 apps, 
Google's ad privacy settings may simply be ignored.
3.3.2 Ineffective SDK Privacy Settings
    Software engineering, like many other types of engineering, 
involves building products out of many pre-made components. For 
example, just as a car manufacturer does not make all the components in 
its cars (e.g., springs and shocks may come from other manufacturers, 
sheet metal is purchased from suppliers, etc.), a mobile app developer 
does not necessarily write all of the code found within their apps. 
Third-party software development kits (SDKs) allow developers to 
include pre-made software components, saving them time and effort. For 
example, rather than find advertisers, organize and/or create ad copy, 
and then determine which users to show which ads, app developers can 
simply outsource that work by incorporating a third-party ad SDK that 
has already implemented those things. There are third-party SDKs that 
help developers with displaying graphics, processing payments, 
streaming audio or video, and so forth. This type of ``code reuse'' is 
an accepted part of modern software engineering. However, it creates 
enormous risks, especially when app developers fail to verify that 
third-party components are functioning as expected (or if third-party 
components are misused).
    Many of the potential COPPA violations that we observed were due to 
the data collection behaviors of third-party SDKs, and not necessarily 
due to code written by app developers; nonetheless, most apps embed 
these third-party SDKs, and there-fore they impact a lot of apps. Many 
of these SDKs, because they are for use in a wide variety of mobile 
apps, offer app developers configuration options so that they can be 
customized to an app's needs. Specifically, many of the SDKs that 
collect personal data with COPPA implications--those that may be used 
to collect personal information from children--offer developers 
configuration options to enable a COPPA-compliant data-collection mode. 
When the app developer uses one of these directives to signal that the 
user is a child, the SDK is instructed to either not use that child's 
personal information for COPPA-prohibited purposes or to not send that 
data to its servers altogether. When developers of children's apps fail 
to correctly configure these types of options, it likely results in 
children's personal data being collected for targeted advertising and 
other prohibited purposes.
    We observed that few developers were correctly configuring third-
party advertising SDKs to disable the collection of personal 
information for profiling and/or ad targeting purposes. For example, we 
observed that 1,280 of the children's apps we tested (21.9 percent) 
transmitted users' personal information to Facebook's servers. Of 
these, only 75 (5.9 percent) correctly signaled to Facebook that the 
user is a child and that the data should be handled pursuant to COPPA. 
However, Facebook is not an isolated example: of the third-party SDKs 
that we observed collecting personal information and that offered 
options for child-directed treatment, none were consistently configured 
correctly by app developers.
    Other third-party SDKs simply provide terms of service that 
prohibit their use in child-directed apps. However, we observed that 
developers of children's apps use these SDKs anyway. By reading the 
terms of service and privacy policies of these data recipients, my 
research team identified several data recipients who (1) describe using 
data received from their SDKs for practices that would be prohibited by 
COPPA, if that data were to come from children; and (2) prohibit 
inclusion of their SDKs in child-directed apps and disclaim any 
knowledge of receiving data from children. Despite this, we identified 
1,100 children's apps transmitting personal information to these 
companies (18.8 percent of the children's apps we tested).
4 Recommendations for Fixing COPPA
    Based on my research, which exposed evidence of rampant non-
compliance with COPPA's existing requirements, I have several 
recommendations for strengthening COPPA, which I detail in this 
section:

   Moving from an ``actual'' to ``constructive'' knowledge 
        standard

   Eliminating the internal operations exemption

   Fixing the Safe Harbor program

   Increasing enforcement
4.1 Moving from ``Actual'' to ``Constructive'' Knowledge
    Many of the potential violations that we observed amounted to 
sharing of persistent identifiers--without verifiable parental 
consent--with companies whose privacy policies state that those 
identifiers will be used for user profiling and/or behavioral 
advertising, activities that are prohibited by COPPA (when that data 
comes from children). These persistent identifiers are generally 
collected and transmitted by third-party SDKs, and so it is plausible 
that many app developers simply do not know when this data is being 
transmitted. However, the third-party data recipients know, and in most 
cases, the information that they are currently receiving allows them to 
trivially determine that the transmitting app was directed at children.
    The privacy policies of many of the companies that receive personal 
information from children's apps state they are directed at general 
audiences and have ``no actual knowledge'' of receiving personal 
information from children, thereby absolving them of any responsibility 
under COPPA. This, however, ignores the fact that each transmission 
from an SDK usually includes the name of the app that transmitted the 
data. The claim that a third-party data recipient does not have actual 
knowledge relies on not knowing whether a particular app is targeted at 
children. Yet, when one looks at the marketing materials of the 
companies receiving this data, and their business models, it is 
apparent that this is precisely the type of knowledge that they claim 
to possess!
    Many online advertising business models rely on knowing the 
demographics of specific apps so that they can target ads based on 
those demographics. That is, their internal data allow them to already 
know or trivially find out which apps are child-directed. For data 
recipients who genuinely do not maintain that data, they can simply 
query the Google Play Store to determine whether or not a given app is 
in the Designed for Families program (and therefore targeted at 
children) based on its public metadata. I can personally write and test 
the code to do this in under an hour. There are also many commercial 
offerings that offer companies programmatic access to this type of 
data. But despite the ease with which data recipients could 
automatically determine whether or not they are receiving data from a 
child-directed app, they choose not to. Instead, most developers of 
third-party SDKs place the burden on app developers, rather than using 
the information that is likely already in their possession--or 
trivially available to them--to automatically configure their services 
for COPPA compliance.
    As I have observed in the course of my research, many app 
developers configure these settings incorrectly (or are simply unaware 
that such settings exist), which results in children being tracked and 
profiled. If third-party data recipients are held to a ``constructive 
knowledge'' standard, under which they would be required to use the 
information at their disposal to identify whether the data they receive 
originates from child-directed services, this would not only result in 
greater compliance and reduced harm to children, but it would also 
result in drastic cost savings, especially amongst smaller software 
development companies and individual entrepreneurs. One ad network 
using their existing data--or data reasonably available to them--to 
automatically apply child-directed treatment to the data they receive 
would negate the need for app developers to individually spend time and 
effort to correctly configure that company's SDK to do so. More to the 
point, a constructive knowledge standard would shift the burden of 
compliance away from millions of small app developers--who would still 
need to report whether or not their apps and services are child-
directed--to the significantly fewer number of data recipients, who are 
much better positioned to apply privacy protections to the data that 
they collect (and are much more likely to do so correctly). In sum, my 
research and experience suggest that moving to a constructive knowledge 
standard would result in fewer incidents of children being 
inadvertently tracked and profiled, as well as economic savings to 
businesses by lessening their compliance costs.
4.2 Eliminating the Internal Operations Exemption
    Currently, persistent identifiers can be collected from children 
without parental con-sent if they are used for the site or service's 
``internal operations,'' which are currently defined by regulations as 
using the data to:\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ 16 C.F.R. Sec. 312.2

  1.  Maintain or analyze the functioning of the Website or online 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        service;

  2.  Perform network communications;

  3.  Authenticate users of, or personalize the content on, the Website 
        or online service;

  4.  Serve contextual advertising on the Website or online service or 
        cap the frequency of advertising;

  5.  Protect the security or integrity of the user, Website, or online 
        service;

  6.  Ensure legal or regulatory compliance; or

  7.  Fulfill a request of a child as permitted by Sec. 312.5(c)(3) and 
        (4);

    From a technical standpoint, the collection of persistent 
identifiers that allow a user's activities to be tracked between apps 
is unnecessary for any of these purposes. The primary issue is that 
each of these use cases could be facilitated by an identifier that is 
unique to a session, an app installation, or developer, which in turn 
could not be used to track the user across other apps and services. For 
example, serving a contextual ad simply requires knowing the type of 
app or website that a user is using or visiting, which is information 
that is already collected; by definition, contextual ads are based on 
those things alone and not the user's identity, and therefore do not 
require the collection of persistent identifiers. Similarly, conversion 
tracking, measurement, fraud detection, and advertising attribution 
also do not need persistent identifiers that can identify users across 
apps. If they are not performing COPPA-prohibited profiling and 
behavioral advertising, an advertising company only needs to know how 
many people clicked on a specific ad, not who those individuals are. 
When user-specific identifiers are needed, ephemeral app-specific or 
session-specific identifiers can be used. This functionality is already 
supported on both Android and iOS, and therefore eliminating the 
internal operations exemption should not create an undue compliance 
burden.
    Furthermore, claims that persistent identifiers are needed for 
these purposes are disingenuous because many app developers are already 
prevented by platform policies from using identifiers for many of these 
purposes. Indeed, on iOS, if a user opts out of online tracking, apps 
are outright prevented from accessing identifiers that could be used to 
track that user's behaviors across apps. Further, Apple already 
requires that no persistent identifiers can be collected from 
children's apps.\6\ Google provides best practices for developers that 
explain how ephemeral identifiers can be used for many of these use 
cases to preserve user privacy.\7\ Thus, it is patently false to claim 
that persistent identifiers are necessary for these purposes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The FTC has previously advocated for companies to take a ``data 
minimization'' approach to online privacy.\8\ I recommend that the 
Subcommittee heed this advice with regard to children's privacy: 
because long-term persistent identifiers are unnecessary for these 
purposes, the internal operations exemption should be eliminated from 
COPPA.

4.3 Fixing the Safe Harbor Program
    The FTC is charged with certifying Safe Harbor self-regulation 
programs under COPPA. As of this date, the FTC's website indicates that 
seven such programs are currently certified.\9\ In the course of my 
group's research [3], we identified 237 Android apps that gave outward 
appearances of having been certified as COPPA-compliant by these 
programs. Yet, when we examined their behaviors, we observed that 24 
(10 percent) collected location data and/or contact information without 
verifiable parental consent, while 77 (32 percent) transmitted personal 
information without taking ``reasonable'' security precautions (e.g., 
using TLS encryption). We concluded that apps certified by these 
programs were just as likely to comply with COPPA as apps not certified 
by them. Indeed, this finding is consistent with prior research on 
industry self-regulation, which found that websites receiving trust 
certifications ``are more than twice as likely to be untrustworthy as 
uncertified sites'' [1]. This begs the question, if an organization is 
already complying with the law, why would they spend additional money 
to protect themselves from enforcement of that law?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ https://www.ftc.gov/safe-harbor-program
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Given the poor incentive structures and lack of transparency into 
how apps are being certified or even determining which apps are 
certified, current Safe Harbor programs do not appear to be effective. 
I have three suggestions for improvements that can be made:

  1.  Apps and services should be certified only after independent 
        forensic evaluations of their privacy behaviors.

  2.  The FTC should develop, in consultation with privacy experts, 
        standards for forensic evaluations of mobile apps' privacy 
        behaviors.

  3.  Certification organizations should publish lists of the apps that 
        they have certified (including versions).

    Based on my examination of the public documents that describe COPPA 
Safe Harbor certification processes, it appears as though current 
certification processes rely primarily on self-reports from app 
developers, rather than forensic examinations of their apps (that would 
yield the type of data that is necessary to assess compliance). Given 
that many app developers are unaware of the privacy issues associated 
with their apps, it would hardly be a surprise that those behaviors do 
not get disclosed to the certification organizations, resulting in 
COPPA-violative apps inadvertently being certified.
    Relatedly, one of the hardest parts of my analysis was simply 
finding the apps that had been certified by each organization, as many 
did not publish information about how they certified each app nor what 
specific apps or versions were even certified. Instead, we relied on 
press releases from those companies, as well as images and text on 
their websites and references in the privacy policies of individual 
apps. Upon publication of these findings, many Safe Harbor 
organizations claimed that the apps that we examined were not actually 
certified by their organizations (despite their names and logos 
appearing on each other's websites). Given that a team of multiple PhDs 
and a lawyer could not disambiguate what has and has not been certified 
by each program, it is hard to expect the average parent to be able to. 
Thus, by mandating that this information be public and in an accessible 
manner, not only would it empower parents to make better decisions, but 
it would strengthen the free market through increased transparency, 
thereby promoting competition.
4.4 Increasing Enforcement Efforts
    Finally, all of the above changes are moot without increased 
enforcement efforts. In under a year of work, my research lab 
identified the transmission of personal information for tracking and 
advertising purposes from literally thousands of child-directed mobile 
apps. At the same time, the FTC, the primary entity empowered with 
enforcing COPPA, historically has pursued only 1-2 COPPA enforcement 
actions each year. This is not for want of known violations. To be 
clear, the FTC employs very capable attorneys and technologists who do 
excellent work. The problem is that there simply are not enough of them 
to investigate all of the violations brought to their attention. As the 
primary agency tasked with enforcing COPPA, it is my opinion that the 
FTC does not have enough resources to bring enough cases for the threat 
of enforcement to serve as a deterrent; similar resourcing problems 
appear to prevent state attorneys general from filling this enforcement 
vacuum. Simply put, if the FTC continues to not receive funding 
commensurate with its enforcement responsibilities, COPPA will remain 
another unfunded mandate.
    I strongly believe that the enforcement problems can be addressed 
in two complementary ways. First, the FTC needs a significant increase 
to its privacy enforcement budget. However, unless this budget is 
increased by orders of magnitude, it is still unlikely to be enough for 
them to be able to investigate all of the potential violations brought 
to their attention. That is why I believe that as a second 
recommendation, Congress should look to the free market and create a 
private right of action. With a private right of action, market forces 
will drive compliance, while at the same time, they will also drive 
competition among industry self-regulation programs. These industry 
self-regulation programs can then be better regulated by the FTC to 
ensure that they are accurate and transparent.
5 Conclusion
    My research has shown that despite COPPA, mobile apps directed at 
children frequently collect children's personal information and share 
it with third-party advertisers and data brokers. I believe that many 
of the problems that I've outline in this testimony can be addressed 
through changes to COPPA. I believe that these pro-posed changes will 
result in greater levels of compliance amongst online services, in-
creased transparency for parents, better protections for their 
children, and increased competition in the marketplace.
    Thank you for giving me the opportunity to testify today. Please do 
not hesitate to follow up with me regarding any questions that you may 
have.

           STATEMENT OF BARONESS BEEBAN KIDRON, OBE,

              CROSSBENCH PEER, HOUSE OF LORDS, UK;

                   CHAIR, 5RIGHTS FOUNDATION

    Ms. Kidron. You do, indeed. And thank you, Chairman 
Blumenthal and Ranking Member Blackburn for inviting me to 
address this critical issue. My apologies for not being with 
you in person.
    I think it is important to make explicit that while I am a 
member of the House of Lords, I am not a member of a political 
party nor the government, but I sit as a crossbench peer. This 
affords me the great privilege of working across both Houses on 
a truly non-partisan basis. And I have authored and introduced 
legislation on this subject and participated in several 
committee inquiries. I am the Co-Founder and Deputy Chair of 
the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Digital Regulation and 
Responsibility. And outside parliament, I chair the 5Rights 
Foundation, a charity that is dedicating to build--to building 
the digital world young people deserve.
    In 2018, as part of the Data Protection Bill, I introduced 
an amendment to create the ``Age-Appropriate Design Code''. The 
AADC, or the Children's Code, as it is fondly and commonly 
known, has some key features. The Code defines a child as any 
person under the age of 18. This is in stark contrast with the 
tech sector that has exploited a gap in legislation to treat 
all 13-year-olds as adults, when any parent will tell you that 
their 13-year-old is not yet an adult. Similarly, the Code is 
applicable to services likely to be accessed by children, 
rather than restricting protections to services directed at 
children. Most children spend most of their time online on 
services which are primarily designed for adult use.
    The 15 provisions of the Code offer children a high bar of 
data protection, including protections from revealing their 
location, using a child's personal data to deliver detrimental 
material, or deliberately nudging them to give up their 
privacy. And as the September 2 deadline for compliance 
approaches, the impact of this one small legislative effort is 
becoming apparent as companies have to redesign their services 
to better protect minors.
    In a recent conversation with one of the major platforms, I 
was told that all their product teams now have to consider not 
only the 15 provisions in total, but also really interrogate 
what its overarching requirement, to process children's data 
in, I quote, ``the best interest of children''. And if I might 
actually quote the code directly, it states, ``It is unlikely 
that the commercial interest of an organization will outweigh a 
child's right to privacy''.
    These baseline protections are overwhelmingly popular with 
the public, that is a public tired with industry norms that 
promote intrusive and addictive design practices or exacerbate 
and recommend harmful material. And they are, frankly, sickened 
by the idea that a child's real time location can be tracked by 
a stranger or predator.
    Four years ago, the UK government announced that they would 
make the UK the safest place to be online by introducing an 
Online Harms Bill. Last week, they finally published the text 
of that bill as the Online Safety Bill. This change of title is 
an important reflection of the journey government officials 
have been on. It is now widely accepted that we cannot argue 
over what is and is not acceptable only after gross harms have 
been committed, after children have suffered. We must consider 
their safety in advance.
    We cannot allow commercial interests to target a depressed 
or unhappy teenager on a Friday night with ads for 
inappropriate drugs, expose 9-year-olds to explicit 
interactions with adults, or push dangerous challenges to 
children through algorithmic recommendations. Just a month ago, 
a 12-year-old from Colorado died after taking part in a 
blackout challenge that was viral on a video-sharing app.
    Mr. Chairman, I know that you are a premier advocate for 
Consumer Education. And as I have worked on this issue around 
the world, gradually policymakers have come on board. But still 
parents, teachers, and very often children themselves feel 
helpless to understand how they are being manipulated. At 
5Rights, we are about to launch a campaign to help bridge this 
gap. It is called Twisted Toys and we have built a suite of 
toys that manifest in a palpable way how Big Tech is spying on 
and putting children at risk. This disturbing project 
graphically illustrates the urgent need for action, and I hope 
you will be seeing a lot more about it in the next month or 
two.
    We do not accept this manipulation of children anywhere 
else. We must not accept it online. And the reason that 
parents, teachers, and children feel overwhelmed that this is--
is because this is not a problem that parents, teachers, or 
kids can solve on their own. A system designed to extract every 
ounce of a child's attention, expose them to an infinite 
public, and encourages them to get lost in the mirror of 
anxiety, is simply not healthy. The tech sector has the ability 
to raise the ceiling and give children back their childhood. 
But it is up to lawmakers to insist on the floor of behavior 
below which they must not go.
    And while the Children Code arguably makes UK's children 
online safety standards the highest in the world, it simply 
will not be good enough. The deficit in American standard 
setting on these issues is alarming. The U.S. is home to the 
most influential tech companies in the world. We are doing what 
we can to protect our children, but we do need this 
administration and we do hope you will act. Because the norms 
you establish in the U.S. impact on every connected child in 
the planet, and that is nearly 1 billion children and counting.
    I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Kidron follows:]

  Prepared Statement of Baroness Beeban Kidron, OBE, Crossbench Peer, 
             House of Lords, UK; Chair, 5Rights Foundation
    Thank you, Chairman Blumenthal and Ranking Member Blackburn for 
inviting me to address this critical issue. I am devoted to protecting 
children from online harms and hope that my legislative experience in 
the United Kingdom and my work with other countries might be of some 
benefit to this Committee. I understand you are considering how to 
better protect children from the dangers they face online every day. 
Children are being monetized by the digital products and services 
focused on the relentless pursuit of every ounce of their attention and 
data, putting them at grave risk of harm.
    It is important to make explicit that while I am a member of the 
House of Lords, I am not a member of a political party nor the 
government but sit as a crossbench peer. This position affords me the 
great privilege of working across both Houses on a truly non-partisan 
basis. I have authored and introduced legislation on this subject and 
participated in several committee inquiries. I am co-founder and deputy 
chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Digital Regulation and 
Responsibility. Outside parliament, I chair the 5Rights Foundation,\1\ 
a charity that does ground-breaking work around the world to make 
systemic changes to digital systems in order to protect children. 
5Rights developed a Child Online Protection Policy for the Government 
of Rwanda, has supported multiple nation state efforts to develop data 
protection regimes, and is working in partnership with the Institute 
for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) to co-create Universal 
Standards for Children and for Digital Services and Products. Most 
recently, 5Rights supported the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
(UNCRC) in drafting general comment No. 25 (2021) on children's rights 
in relation to the digital environment.\2\ This authoritative document 
adopted in March this year is anticipated to have global significance 
on the expectations and duties of states and business to children. I 
also work with international bodies such as the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), UNESCO Broadband 
Commission and EU organisations on issues such as Artificial 
Intelligence (AI), child-centred design and data protection.

    In 2012, when smartphones began to be priced at a point that 
allowed a parent to provide this powerful device to a child, childhood 
fundamentally changed. This device, increasingly glued to their pocket, 
bedroom, hand, and gaze, gave children unfettered access to a world of 
breath-taking richness and variety. It also gave adults and commercial 
entities unfettered and unchecked access to children--access that has 
been ruthlessly exploited.
    In the UK, it has been 150 years since we took children out of the 
chimneys and put them in the classroom--arguably the beginning of what 
we now conceive of as childhood. Childhood is a journey from dependence 
to autonomy with its own set of vulnerabilities and learning. Childhood 
is not a risk-free business, but there is broad consensus that we have 
a duty of care, which requires us to protect children from foreseeable 
risks and preventable harms--a duty on us as parents, politicians and 
businesses. This consensus is taken for granted in the decisions we 
make about all parts of children's lives--except the digital world. 
Members of this committee that is not acceptable. My personal battle 
and political commitment is to ensure this wrong is put right.
    In 2018, as part of the Data Protection Bill, I introduced an 
amendment to create the ``Age Appropriate Design Code (AADC).\3\ The 
AADC, or Children's Code, as it is commonly known, has some key

This is in stark contrast with the tech sector that has exploited a gap 
in legislation to treat all 13-year-olds as adults, when any parent 
will tell you that their 13-year-old is not an adult. Similarly, the 
Code is applicable to services `likely to be accessed by children' 
rather than restricting protections to services directed at children. 
Most children spend most of their time online on services which are 
primarily designed for adults.

    The 15 provisions of the Children's Code are interconnected and 
interdependent--but together they offer children a high bar of data

a child's personal data to deliver detrimental material, or 
deliberately nudging them to give up their privacy. As the September

their services to better protect minors, including disabling features 
that allow direct messaging of children by unknown adults,\4\ providing 
clearer terms of service,\5\ putting age assurance schemes in place,\6\ 
offering tailored services for children of different ages,\7\ and 
making default settings that automatically offer a high bar of safety 
and data privacy for children's profiles.\8\

    Even with this draft Online Safety Bill, much work remains. In a 
busy legislative season, I will also be introducing a private member's 
bill to set standards for age assurance providers. While private 
member's bills rarely end up as statutes, they are an important vehicle 
for policy makers to flesh out arguments. Every policy conversation 
about children in the digital world eventually comes down to the 
question of age assurance and age verification. I have shared a recent 
5Rights report \15\ ``But how do they know it is a child?'' with the 
Subcommittee as part of my written testimony. Age assurance is a not a 
question of innovation, but of governance and agreed standards. Since 
the release of ``But how do they know it is a child?'' and the 
announcement of my private member's bill, I have been inundated by 
politicians, businesses, the tech sector, regulators and advocacy 
organizations, all saying how much they would welcome clear and 
enforceable standards of practice.

    Mr. Chairman, I know that you are a premier advocate for Consumer 
Education having spent so much of your career as your state's top law 
enforcement official, so let me finish with one last observation--that 
has had a surprising outcome. As I have worked on this issue around the 
world gradually policymakers have come on board--but still parents, 
teachers and very often children themselves feel helpless to understand 
how they are being manipulated. At 5Rights we are about to launch a 
campaign to help bridge this gap. It is called Twisted Toys and we have 
built a suite of toys that manifest in a palpable way how Big Tech is 
spying on and putting children at risk. This disturbing project 
graphically illustrates the urgent need for action--and you'll be 
seeing more about it in the next month or two.
    We do not accept this manipulation of children anywhere else--we 
must not accept it online. The reason that parents, teachers and 
children feel overwhelmed is that this is not a problem that parents, 
teachers or kids can solve on their own. A system designed to extract 
every ounce of a child's attention, expose them to an infinite public 
and encourages them to get lost in the mirror of anxiety, is not 
healthy. The tech sector has the ability to raise the ceiling and to 
give children back their childhood--but it is up to legislators to 
insist on the floor of behaviour below which they must not go.
    There is a big and growing gap between the needs of children and 
the regulation in place, the digital world has transformed, but our 
protections for children have not kept apace. The U.S. is home to many 
of the companies that dominate the sector, what lawmakers in the U.S. 
do for children will ricochet around the world. How COPPA is reformed, 
the role and resource of the FTC and the willingness of this 
administration to put child protection top of its policy agenda, will 
impact on the lives of children everywhere.
    In the UK, this is an issue that cuts across all party lines--it 
cuts across all ideological lines. I believe that the same strong 
consensus exists here, too. I have spent many years on this and wish to 
share whatever expertise I have. I stand ready to work with all of you. 
I hope that your committee will take up the challenge to lead the 
change. We are beyond the point of deciding whether this is a problem. 
It is time to work on the solution, and if I had to choose where to 
start--it would be with a comprehensive data protection bill which 
offers all children under 18 protections, by design and default.
    I look forward to your questions.

    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you very, very much, Baroness. We 
will now begin 5-minute rounds of questioning. I will go to the 
Ranking Member after I finish and then, others on the 
Committee.
    I think that the Baroness put it exactly right. These sites 
are extracting information, but also exploiting children. And 
parents cannot protect their children alone. Senator Graham and 
I introduced the EARN IT Act which, essentially, enables 
parents to fight the sexual grooming, exploitation, 
trafficking, torture, and rape of children. It is a real and 
present danger.
    The statistic that one-quarter of all children are 
solicited on the Internet for illicit sexual purposes is just 
absolutely alarming and astonishing. And the EARN IT Act would 
create a narrow exception to Section 230 to empower survivors 
to stop the sharing of images and video of their sexual abuse. 
It is a narrow, exceedingly targeted exception to Section 230. 
And the question is for all the witnesses. Should we not 
broaden that kind of exemption, so that the sites themselves, 
not just the exploiters, are held accountable?
    TikTok's failure to appear today, I think, is in some ways 
an admission that there are no adequate answers on its part to 
what is happening on that site. Sixty-six percent of all 
children use TikTok. And the idea that it is extracting this 
information, then exploiting it, but giving others an 
opportunity to do so, with the knowledge that it is happening, 
I think, argues powerfully for modifications in Section 230, 
perhaps incorporating the age-appropriate design code that 
Baroness Kidron has championed so ably in the United Kingdom.
    Let me begin with you, Professor Campbell. Should we modify 
Section 230?
    Ms. Campbell. I certainly think it is--I think it is 
something we need----
    Senator Blumenthal. I think you need your microphone.
    Ms. Campbell. We need to look at that question very 
carefully because I agree that many operators are getting away 
with conduct that, I will tell you, online would not be 
permitted. And therefore, because they do not--they are immune, 
or largely immune from prosecution, they have no incentive to 
stop. This same time, obviously, it needs to be narrowly 
tailored. It would need to pay attention to, not chilling 
speech that is protected by the First Amendment, and also 
harming small businesses who really cannot afford the kinds of 
litigation that might--but again, I do think that the idea is 
one that should be pursued.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you. Mr. Egelman.
    Mr. Egelman. I think I would--I need to think about that a 
little bit more. The--I think there are things that could be 
done without touching on some of the free speech issues 
associated with Section 230, that would potentially, you know, 
do the same thing. Such as, you know, moving to the 
constructive knowledge standard and have other reporting 
requirements, you know, to strengthen COPPA without necessarily 
touching that. But honestly, I think I would need to think a 
little more about that.
    I mean, my main concern is how that could--you know, 
unintended consequences of that. So, how that could be abused.
    Senator Blumenthal. Baroness Kidron.
    Ms. Kidron. Thank you. I think I am going to answer from 
the perspective of the Code, because one of the things that has 
really troubled me is that we have concentrated on what we do 
once we see somthing has happened--once--once children are 
being groomed. And I think that we have not considered enough, 
safety by design. And what we really need to start seeing now 
is proper platform accountability about its design features. 
For example, introducing strange adults to children as a normal 
piece of design, or making children very--very public. And at 
the same time, promoting a culture of popularity and of 
revealing, and so on. And I think there are a lot of things 
that we can do before we start on Section 230.
    What I would say is that the failure to keep companies 
accountable for what they recommend, for what they rank, for 
what they promote, is quite different from accountability for 
what you host.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you. Would you agree, Professor 
Campbell--and I will ask the same question of the others--that 
Instagram should cancel its plans for Instagram Kids?
    Ms. Campbell. Yes.
    Senator Blumenthal. Mr. Egelman.
    Mr. Egelman. Probably, yes. Yes, I will just leave it at 
that. I mean, I think concern there is just that--I guess I 
will not leave it at that. The concern there, I think, is even 
if the Instagram Kids is, you know, benign and is not 
collecting all of the data from kids, it is another type of 
grooming behavior, right? It is--it is locking them in to the 
platform so that when they turn 13, all their friends are on 
Instagram. Now they are locked in and need to continue using 
it, and now it does start collecting all of their data. And 
then, they--you know, they are stuck making a choice. Do they 
abandon those social connection or, you know, give up privacy?
    Senator Blumenthal. Essentially, it grooms them, it 
prepares them, it extracts information, and it creates this web 
of involvement that is really perilous.
    Mr. Egelman. Yes, exactly. And I think that one of the 
things that does come up a lot in the research, especially when 
looking at consumer perceptions about privacy, is this notion 
of learned helplessness. Where, you know, consumers just, you 
know, understand that they do not know how to, you know, tackle 
these privacy issues and have just, sort of, gotten accustomed 
to giving away their privacy because they do not really feel 
that they have a choice.
    Senator Blumenthal. Baroness Kidron.
    Ms. Kidron. I think, Chairman, you know, Facebook has not 
earned our trust to start doing children's services in this 
way. And I think, unless you have standards, unless you have 
agreement about what is a fitting platform for children, then 
of course, they should not go ahead and do this new platform. 
They cannot be trusted with children until we set out what that 
looks like.
    Senator Blumenthal. Facebook has not only failed to earn 
our trust, it has actually betrayed our trust, in many respects 
in its practices with Messenger Kids, allowing strangers to 
chat with children. Its other violations of trust certainly 
argue powerfully against, now, Instagram Kids. So, I hope that 
it will cancel its plans. Ranking Member Blackburn.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you 
to each of you for a very thoughtful discussion on this.
    I have been hard at work at, what I call, the Virtual You 
Protection Agenda, which would be privacy, data security, some 
Section 230 reforms--tightening up the language there in 
Section 230--and then, dealing with antitrust. And I think it 
is time we realized these are not companies that are in their 
infancy. They are full grown companies. Their valuations are 
high. And they are very intentional in the moves that they 
make. And, Ms. Campbell, I appreciate your comments in regard 
to the intentionality of the moves that these companies are 
making, with how they data mine, and track, and utilize that 
information.
    Baroness, I want to come to you first. You mentioned the 
contrast between the children's online age gaps in the U.S. 
compared to Europe. And in the U.S., where we do not consider 
an adult until you turn 18, but online children 13 and 14 can 
easily get full access to certain applications, without their 
parents permission. And I think this really leaves them 
vulnerable.
    And we have mentioned Snapchat a couple of times and in 
2019, I wrote a letter to the CEO of Snap, raising concerns 
about how child predators were arrested talking to underage 
children through this app. This is just--as a grandmother, I--
that is something that you just have to say, how in the world 
can they not find a way to tighten up this process?
    But you mentioned safety by design. So, how do you think 
that raising the online adulthood age would change the way that 
companies approach children's privacy on their apps? And talk 
to me a little bit about how companies in the UK and Europe 
have adapted to the changes that you all have made.
    Ms. Kidron. Yes, thank you for that question. And I think 
both the Chairman and you are speaking powerfully to the fact 
that the world of tech has transformed immeasurably, but the 
regulation has not kept up. And I do not think that the 
Internet founders had it in their mind that this was going to 
be the interlocutor of all childhood. And this habit, you know, 
taking the habits and thoughts and feelings of children and 
capturing them--you know, TikTok, Google, Facebook, Snap, and 
other unaccountable companies. And I think we should be worried 
that a child's latest selfie is stored for purposes yet to be 
decided in some server farm, whether that is in Hubei Province, 
in China, or in Nevada, USA.
    So, I think that we have a global issue here, which is, as 
you say, you know, a child of 13 is not an adult and we must 
now extend our concern to children up until the age of 18. So, 
adults, we can discuss differently, but children, we have a 
duty of care to, and we must fulfill that duty of care.
    To your point about the tech companies, I have a lot of 
conversations with engineers. And in fact, I always say, that 
if I had a pound, or indeed a dollar, for every time an 
engineer had said to me, ``I have never thought about it like 
that before'', I could actually finance our foundation from one 
end of the year to another.
    What I mean by that is that we have to change our mindset. 
We have to think about what it means to be a child in that 
environment, and immediately, in relation to the code, what 
they had to do is actually disband direct messaging for certain 
age groups. They are not--they do not have the cognitive 
ability to work out whether that stranger is friend or foe. 
Just do not do it.
    And in the code, it actually says, ``Do not use their data 
to offer them detrimental material''. And that is--you know, do 
not use their browsing history. Do not use the fact they 
hovered over something to then--to recommend it or rank it or 
put it into their feed. And so, I think that it is actually 
easier than we think.
    What it is, is a commitment, is minimum standards, and it 
is a very, very clear enforcement path to say, this is what you 
must do. Not, this is what you could do or do a bit better, but 
this is what you must do. Because, actually, childhood is a 
precious stage and children do not grow up to be good adults 
unless they have decent childhoods.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you for that. Mr. Egelman, let me 
come to you. Talking about this privacy by design and you 
mentioned about how some of the companies are--use these 
personal identifiers and how these are used in concert with 
third-party data sets and algorithms, to build more accurate 
profiles of our children. Which is really a frightening thought 
when you look at the length of time that they can begin to 
gather that information and follow them.
    So, talk to me a little bit about the safeguards that app 
developers could be using, in order to--to protect the 
children's PII.
    Mr. Egelman. Yes, that is a really good question. It 
actually hits on a few points you brought up earlier, too. So, 
one of the biggest problems I see right now with COPPA, is that 
it shifts the compliance burden to lots of small developers who 
just really do not know what their obligations are. And then, 
invariably, you know, screw up by misconfiguring, you know, 
some third-party component that ends up sending data, you know, 
to advertisers or data aggregators.
    There are also--certainly, there are also malicious actors, 
who are intentionally doing that in children's apps. But the 
net result is the same thing, right? At the end of the day, 
there is some third-party that is building dossiers of 
children. And whether the data was sent to them because, you 
know, the app developer knew they were doing that and, you 
know, because they get paid more to do it, or because something 
was just misconfigured, the app developers, essentially, have 
all the responsibility under the actual knowledge standard, 
right now. Because those third-parties, you know, just say, oh, 
well, we have no--we did not know that this is children's data 
and, therefore, we are not liable. And that is, currently, the 
state of the world.
    I disagree, actually, with something that Professor 
Campbell said earlier, which is that it is difficult to figure 
out when apps are child directed. In many cases it is not. So, 
that information is public. Like, in the Google Play Store, 
when you download apps, there are categories. And if the app is 
in the kids' category, that means the developer actually went 
in there, when they uploaded the app, and clicked the button 
saying this is a child directed app. And to their credit, 
Google had a--you know, has a pop-up that asks them if they are 
in compliance with COPPA. And of course, they, you know, click 
yes and now, their app is suddenly available in the Play Store.
    Anyone can actually just visit the Play Store or the Apple, 
you know, the iOS app store and see, you know, whether a given 
app is in the children's category or not, and then, use that 
information to realize that there is likely receiving data from 
children and take appropriate action, like delete it 
immediately and not do anything with it. But the fundamental 
problem is that they are receiving it.
    A lot of the issues here come from this--the failure to 
adhere to privacy by design principles. And so, there is a 
whole framework, called Privacy by Design, that has several 
different principles. The most relevant here is data 
minimization. So, data should only be, you know, sent when 
absolutely necessary. In this case, you know, this hits on the 
internal operations exemption.
    So, there are all of these exemptions for which these 
persistent identifiers can be collected and then, used for 
tracking purposes. But because there is ambiguity about what is 
considered internal operations, this data is being collected, 
even though it is not strictly needed.
    So, an example of that, one of the carve outs is contextual 
advertising. So, contextual advertising is in contrast to 
behavioral advertising, where you are not receiving ads based 
on your, you know, history of what websites and apps, you have, 
you know, visited and played, but instead, you know, just what 
you are doing in the moment. So, what is the name of the 
current app? In theory, you know, the marketing company, you 
know, is able to infer, given a user uses this app, you know, 
this is an appropriate ad to send them. So, maybe, like, an 
real estate app, you know, app is going to have ads for, you 
know, real estate agents, or something like that.
    The point is, though, if it is all contextual, which is 
allowed under COPPA, by definition, they do not need the 
persistent identifiers to, you know, to figure out which 
individual user that is and create, you know, a dossier about 
them. And so, that is why, yes, I think data minimization, you 
know, would go a long way here.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you. I know my time is probably 
up.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you. We are going to go now to 
Senator Klobuchar.

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much. I want to thank 
you, Senator Blumenthal and Senator Blackburn for having this 
hearing. Such a timely, timely hearing. We all know that more 
kids have been online during the pandemic. But we also know 
that years of hearing, ``trust me'', from the social media 
platforms have not--has not worked.
    So, I guess I will start with you, Ms. Campbell. In your 
testimony, you noted a complaint, filed with the FTC, that 
ultimately led to the 2019 YouTube settlement. And know you 
referenced (inaudible) opening. Do you think those (inaudible) 
or do you think we should be doing for holding these companies 
accountable?
    Ms. Campbell. I am sorry, Senator. I could not quite hear 
the last part of the--I heard you talking about YouTube----
    Senator Klobuchar. So, what more do you think--I am talking 
about what more should be done to hold the companies 
accountable with the YouTube settlement, yes.
    Ms. Campbell. Yes, OK.
    Senator Klobuchar. Mm-hmm.
    Ms. Campbell. Yes, and this actually relates to what 
Professor Egelman was talking about. Google, in the case of 
Google Play, does have a section called Designated for 
Families, and all of those ads--all of those apps that are 
available are supposed to comply with COPPA and they are 
supposed to not have any inappropriate advertising. They are 
not supposed to have a deceptive and unfair advertising 
techniques. There is just a number of, actually quite good, 
policies that Google has in place. The problem is that Google 
does not enforce them. And that is what his research showed and 
other--much other research has showed.
    And that is why we also filled to a complaint against 
Google Play, asking the FTC to investigate whether it was 
making misrepresentations or--to the public about what it was 
doing. The FTC--this was filed in December 2018. The FTC did 
not take any action. We recently filed an update that cited 
some of this new research. And also, the fact that there was a 
major class action suit that was settled and will require at 
least some of these third-party companies--which are mostly 
companies people have never heard of, like, Applovin and Unity 
and Vungle and things like that--would require them to really 
clean up their business somewhat.
    But I do think there is a lot more--it is not possible, 
even with all the resources in the world, for the FTC to go 
after every individual developer, and every different 
programmer that is uploading videos to YouTube. And so, 
therefore, I think the platforms need to be held accountable.
    Senator Klobuchar. Agreed. So, a report found--I guess this 
is for you, Mr. Egelman. A report found that more than 90 
percent of U.S. parents believe that the Children's Online 
Privacy Protection Act, which only protects kids under 13, 
should be expanded to teens. Do you agree with expanding the 
protections?
    Mr. Egelman. Absolutely. I mean, I think adults should have 
the same protections, you know, to opt out of this tracking 
when they, you know, so choose. But yes, no, I certainly think 
that the age should be increased.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. We have been talking a lot about 
disinformation out there. Senator Lujan and I led a letter to 
the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter, highlighting a report which 
found that approximately 65 percent of anti-vaccine content can 
be attributed to 12 individuals. We call then the 
Disinformation Dozen. Do you believe--and this can be for 
anyone on the panel--that the spread of misinformation online 
is particularly harmful for kids and teens? And not just about 
the vaccine, just misinformation in general. Baroness, if you 
want to take this, or anyone.
    Ms. Kidron. Yes, I would, and I think it is a really 
important point. And forgive me, but there is certainly a 
hailstorm in the background, if I sound a little funny.
    You know, it is really quite crucial for children to trust 
and understand and grow to appreciate the nuance of information 
they are given. And they, themselves, repeatedly say that they 
are confused about what is true and what is false. And all the 
evidence points to the fact that they find it difficult to 
separate it out and it is destabilizing.
    And I think that--that you are absolutely right to make the 
point that it is information, not only disinformation around 
health and so on, that we saw in the pandemic, but actually, 
they also report disinformation in terms of images about what 
they should look like, how they should behave. The truth that 
they are constantly presented with and they find it very, very 
problematic. And we have a duty to do better by them, as they 
grow up in a digital world.
    Senator Klobuchar. Very well said. Thank you. Thank you, 
everyone.
    Senator Blumenthal. Senator Markey.

               STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD MARKEY, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS

    Senator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much. Thank 
you for having this very important hearing today. Thank you to 
Ranking Member Blackburn.
    Protecting kids online has been a priority of mine for a 
long time and the COVID pandemic has actually made it even more 
clear. You know, the kids' use of this technology is just going 
through the roof and it is exposing even more problems that 
have existed for the last 20 years, in terms of kids' exposure 
to it. And it is why, earlier this month, I introduced, with 
Senator Cassidy, a bipartisan Children's and Teens' Online 
Privacy Protection Act, which builds on the original COPPA law, 
the Child Online Privacy Protection Act, which I was the author 
of in 1998.
    This new COPPA 2.0 helps to protect kids up to the age of 
16--13, 14, 15-year-olds. The original law was just 12 and 
under. Not adequate, not in this new world that we live in. And 
it would require consent in order to collect information from 
them. It would also prohibit websites and apps from collecting 
more data than they need to fulfill the service that the teen 
is requesting.
    The tech industry just loves getting all this information 
about children in our society. They just keep coming in on 
children, the tech industry, and gathering this information. 
The tech industry is just out of control on this issue. So, 
from my perspective, do you agree that young teens are an 
especially vulnerable audience that deserves much higher levels 
of protection?
    Ms. Campbell. Yes, I do.
    Senator Markey. Do you agree with that, Mr.----
    Mr. Egelman. Yes, absolutely.
    Senator Markey.--Egelman. Yes, thank you. The legislation 
also includes a requirement that platforms should reasonably 
know that kids are on their websites and apps, to get parental 
consent, in order to collect children's data. After all, these 
companies have a lot of information about who is on their 
websites.
    Ms. Campbell, can you quickly explain why this constructive 
knowledge standard will help protect children's privacy by 
stopping websites from turning a blind eye to the fact that 
kids are on their platforms?
    Ms. Campbell. Thank you, Senator. Under the current law, 
operator is not responsible for complying with COPPA unless 
their service or website is directed at children, or if they 
have, what is known as, actual knowledge. Which gives them the 
incentive to say, oh, we do not--we are not for kids. We do not 
have kids online. When in fact, they do know, because they are 
collecting so much information from these kids, that they can, 
you know, use this information to determine age. And often, you 
know, they also know because--TikTok, I do not know how they 
can say they do not when they--you know, there are so many 
articles about how kids are on the service.
    So--so, yes, I do think that changing to constructive 
knowledge would make this an easier standard, both to apply and 
practice, but also for the companies themselves. I think the--
it is a--it is a natural--it is like they knew, or they should 
have known. It does not really depend on whether they actually 
knew what the algorithm was doing. And I think, in Professor 
Egelman's testimony--written testimony, he also addresses----
    Senator Markey. Yes, thank you.
    Ms. Campbell. Yes.
    Senator Markey. And I know that you agree, as well, Mr. 
Egelman. So, let me--let me just say that I do think it is 
critical because of these tech firms and their exploitation of 
children. It is absolutely disgraceful what is going on. The 
tech industry just--you kick them in the heart, you are going 
to break your toe, in terms of their relationship with children 
in our society.
    So, I just think we need to add a constructive knowledge 
standard. That is critical to protect children. And I believe 
that the Committee also should build on consent and disclosure 
requirements by enacting data use limitations. And one of those 
data use limitations should be outright ban on targeting 
advertising to children.
    Ms. Kidron, do you agree that Congress should prohibit 
online advertisers from using children's data to target ads to 
them?
    Ms. Kidron. Yes, I do. Before I answer your question, 
Senator Markey, can I pay tribute to the work that you have 
done, for so many years, on behalf of children, and recognize 
that the world over, we know your name and the actions you have 
taken. So, I just want to make that clear from here in London.
    Absolutely, targeted ads should be prohibited. Using 
children's data for that purpose is inappropriate. Contextual 
ads are perfectly adequate for the market. And I think that 
traditional communication law, both here in the UK and I 
believe in Congress, has already set out why it is 
unaccessible--unacceptable to bombard children with 
advertising.
    You know, childhood is a journey. Children do not have the 
cognitive capacity and life experience to understand the high 
arts of advertising and influence.
    Senator Markey. No, I appreciate that. Thank you so much. 
And Senator Blumenthal and I recently wrote a letter to 
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg demanding answers about the social 
media company's plans for an Instagram plan to start bringing 
more children into their world. The company has yet to disclose 
all of the details of this plan, but it is clear that there are 
major risks to kids' privacy and well-being on this type of 
platform. Instagram for children sounds superficially very 
attractive, but we understand that it is a very vulnerable 
audience. Unfortunately, in its response to Senator Blumenthal 
and I, which I asked to be included in the record today----
    Senator Blumenthal. Without objection.
    [The information referred to follows:]

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

    Senator Markey. Facebook refused to give Senator Blumenthal 
and I any meaningful commitments about how to ensure that its 
proposed Instagram Kids app does not harm young users mental 
health and threaten their privacy. And that is why I am 
strongly urging Facebook to abandon its plans to launch a 
version of Instagram for kids. Ms. Campbell, do you share 
Senator Blumenthal and my concern about Facebook's proposal?
    Ms. Campbell. Yes, I do. I think it has already been 
discussed how they have not earned our trust. They have a bad 
track record. I was one of the signatories of a letter that 
asked them to stop it and I think, given the way--since 
Instagram--there are already lots of kids on Instagram. There 
are already--you know, it has some negative effects and to open 
it up to even younger children is, I just think, a huge mistake 
and a big risk.
    Senator Markey. Yes. I think that, unfortunately, when it 
comes to putting children ahead of the profits, Big Tech always 
fails. They forfeited the benefit of the doubt on this issue. 
It is time for this Congress to pass comprehensive privacy 
legislation to protect children.
    This goes on year after year after year after year. And we 
have to continue to wait and wait and wait and wait to put 
these protection on the books for our children in our country. 
They are being targeted. They are vulnerable. We know it is 
happening. We can pass a law this year to protect these 
children. We should put it at the top of our tech agenda.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you, Senator Markey. And I 
strongly share your view that Facebook's response to us was 
abysmally inadequate on Instagram Kids, failing to address our 
reservations and concerns. And I think the impatience with Big 
Tech's invasion of privacy and exploitive practices is now very 
broadly felt and bipartisan, as is indicated by the comments 
that have been made today. And they should be on notice that, 
either they come to the table and participate in meaningful 
protection, or they will have failed to be part of this 
dialogue and there should be action this session. Thank you.
    Senator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Blumenthal. Senator Lee.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE LEE, 
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM UTAH

    Senator Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to all of you 
for being here today. This is such an important topic and I 
share the passion that has been expressed by my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle here. These are things that we need to 
address.
    In the past there have been a handful of factors that have, 
at times, slowed progress or, in some cases, even reversed it. 
Some of them are technical; others are constitutional. 
Sometimes the technical and the constitutional merge.
    As--as you are aware, in order to survive a First Amendment 
challenge, where the First Amendment is implicated, if you have 
got a government action that interferes with free speech, you 
have got to be able to survive strict scrutiny. Which means 
that you have got to show that the government action, at issue, 
is directed at something, as to which, there is a compelling 
state interest. A compelling governmental interest must be the 
object of the legislation. And it must further that compelling 
state interest in the least intrusive, least restrictive 
means--through the least restrictive means possible.
    At times, this has become a problem, as--as we learned in 
1997 in a case called Reno v. ACLU. In that case, the Supreme 
Court of the United States invalidated provisions of the 
Communications Decency Act. Provisions that would have 
prohibited the transmission of certain indecent content to 
minors.
    Now, in that case, as I recall, the Supreme Court concluded 
that the online harm and the risk of online harm to children, 
was itself a compelling governmental interest. But the 
provisions at issue did not provide the least restrictive means 
to achieve that compelling state interest. Specifically, the 
court found that the age verification process for children, at 
the time, simply was not viable and would potentially prohibit 
access of others who should not be prohibited from accessing 
such content.
    Now, that was back in 1997. 1997, I think, was the year I 
purchased my first cell phone, and it was a relatively decent 
phone, at the time. It just made phone calls. It did not do 
anything else, nothing else at all. And we were, of course, a 
decade away from anything resembling an iPhone. But since then, 
things have changed.
    So, Professor Campbell, in your view, has technology 
advance sufficiently since 1997, such that age verification is 
now a reality, in a way that it might not have been then? Could 
we overcome this hurdle now?
    Ms. Campbell. I cannot really speak so much to technology. 
I do know that, as part of this data collection, that companies 
often will infer, or these advertising networks will be able to 
infer the age of the users, so that it may well be much--I 
mean, certainly it would be more possible today than it was in 
1997. And also, I mean, there are just so many more kids online 
and everyone online doing--using it for so many different 
purposes. And in just so many ways, the world is completely 
different than it was in 1997.
    Senator Lee. From that, one could certainly argue that our 
ability today to use the least restrictive means of furthering 
a compelling state interest is significantly enhanced, relative 
to what it was 24 years ago.
    Ms. Campbell. Yes. I think so. But I also want to point out 
that commercial speech, at least this deceptive, is not 
permitted to children. That--we--with children are different 
than adults, in that, we as adults have some responsibility for 
their--their well-being. And so, there are certain things that 
we would not permit to be regulated as to adults, we do permit 
to be regulated as to children.
    Senator Lee. Sure.
    Ms. Campbell. And so----
    Senator Lee. So, once you enter into the territory of 
Central Hudson, then if it is--if it is deceptive, you may have 
other tools that will not, themselves, trigger strict scrutiny.
    Ms. Campbell. That is correct.
    Senator Lee. Now, online platforms gather a lot of data 
with regard to their users. Understandably so. I mean, this is 
their business. They want to understand. They want to make 
sense of the marketplace in order to facilitate targeted 
advertising. That is how many, if not most, of them make a 
living. But I am concerned about what that can mean, at times, 
with respect to children and how they target children. And what 
they are doing, or not doing, to protect children.
    Baroness Kidron, do--do online companies know, or if they 
do not know, should they know--should they be expected and 
required to know the age of the minors who have profiles on 
their respective platforms?
    Ms. Kidron. Yes, Senator. I think--if I could just point at 
something that happened a couple of weeks ago in Australia, 
where researchers asked to find 13- to 17-year-olds with an 
interest in alcohol, smoking, gambling, extreme weight loss, 
fast foods, online dating services. Those were 13- to 17-year-
olds. And they were then able to fabricate ads mentioning 
prizes, cocktails, and asking them if they were Summer ready.
    You see how insidious it is. So, it is not even just should 
they know, could they know, to which it is an unequivocal yes, 
it is even when they do know, they are not treating them 
properly. And if I might also just say, narrowly to your point 
that you just asked previously, is 5Rights recently wrote a 
report about age assurance, ``How Do They Know How Old We 
Are?'' And I have sent it to the Committee, and I think what is 
absolutely true in your observation is very sophisticated.
    It is, indeed, the case that things have changed. We do 
have technology. What we do not have is governance, 
transparency, and an agreement about what age assurance should 
be, how it should be properly deployed.
    So, I think the answer to both your question is, you know, 
we do have the means. We do not yet have the will.
    Senator Lee. Mr. Chairman, I realize my time has expired. 
Could I ask one follow-up question----
    Senator Blumenthal. Sure.
    Senator Lee. That leads naturally? Thank you very much. 
Baroness, I would like to go back to you for a moment and 
follow up on an observation you just made. I have learned a lot 
about this from a number of experts in the field, and 
especially, my friend Melissa McKay from Utah, who has done a 
lot of work educating parents and children about the risks 
associated with content that can be obtained online, very often 
through social media platforms, by children.
    Sometimes the content is delivered to them, with full 
knowledge of how old they are, because of the fact that, when 
they open an account, they are required to provide certain 
information about their age. And even with that, sometimes one 
could argue because of that, they receive awful, awful content 
delivered to them, knowing what they have.
    And yet, these apps--these social media platforms often 
operate through apps that are, themselves, subject to app age 
appropriateness ratings on the Google app store, and also on 
the Apple app store. And in many instances, these age 
appropriateness app ratings on the app stores indicate that the 
apps themselves are suitable for children, in other cases for 
teenagers, including young teenagers.
    So, why--why is there such a disparity sometimes, between 
the apps listed age appropriateness rating and the content 
available on that platform, and sometimes sent to a minor--to a 
child, on that platform? Why the disparity?
    Ms. Kidron. Yes, I mean, well, I think you maybe needed to 
ask TikTok, if only they would show. No, I think the truth is, 
in fact, I should revise that and say, Google and Apple. I have 
raised this question in Parliament. I have raised it more than 
once. And I think it is extraordinary that we do not have a 
regulation or a law that says the app store must give the same 
age rating as the terms and conditions. But in fact, we go on, 
consistently, and find many, many apps that are labeled one 
thing--nine, 10, you know, very young ages that then turn out 
to be 16 and 18. And it is something I will be turning my 
attention to and I hope it is something the Committee will turn 
its attention to.
    I think the other thing that I would like to say to you is 
that, recently, we did some research--again, we will be 
publishing it shortly. But it was the case that we were able--
we could see a child being targeted with, actually, government 
safety information. But that same child was being targeted with 
self-harm material. In one case, a very, very aggressive adult 
pornography, and so on.
    And I think this point, that I am trying to make is, yes, 
we can find out they are children. And there are new ways of 
looking at age assurance that are data-light and do not 
interfere with other users. But also, we have to extend and put 
in protections for those users that they know are children. I 
mean, this is just essential.
    Senator Lee. Thank you, Baroness. Really appreciate that 
and I would love to work with you in that effort. Thank you, 
Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thanks, Senator Lee. Senator Lujan.

               STATEMENT OF HON. BEN RAY LUJAN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO

    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Chairman Blumenthal, and thank 
you to you and to Ranking Member Blackburn for addressing this 
urgent subject.
    Child safety online is a pressing issue in New Mexico. My 
home state is currently pursuing multiple court cases to hold 
companies accountable when they violate child privacy laws. I 
am grateful for New Mexico's leadership in protecting the 
safety and privacy of young children online.
    Ms. Campbell, in one of these cases, Google is accused of 
improperly collecting students physical location, browsing 
history, search history, contacts, and even voice recordings, 
through its educational products. Google is used in over half 
of American public schools for its free products, and I do not 
believe that parents should have to choose between their 
child's privacy and their education.
    Ms. Campbell, yes or no, do believe collecting data for 
advertising purposes is ever appropriate in the classroom?
    Ms. Campbell. No, it is not.
    Senator Lujan. Dr. Egelman, I know you have worked closely 
on one of those New Mexico cases. In fact, your lab was among 
the first to publicly report violations by Tiny Lab Productions 
to Google. In that case, Google first reviewed the app under 
question when it was submitted to its Designed for Families. 
That is a program that they have. And again, after you alerted 
the company, still Google did not immediately classify the game 
as being primarily directed to children, despite clear 
advertising that the game was for kids and would ``keep them 
entertained for hours''. And those are all quotes--``keep them 
entertained for hours'', ``right from Google'', ``for kids'', 
``primarily directed to children''.
    Google eventually changed course, but it took months for it 
to terminate the developer. By that time, the app had already 
been downloaded millions of times. Yes or no, to ensure that 
these apps do not take advantage of children, should Google 
reform its app review process?
    Mr. Egelman. Absolutely, yes.
    Senator Lujan. What recommendations do you have there, Mr. 
Egelman, for reform?
    Mr. Egelman. I think one of the biggest problems is that 
there is not really a review process. So, Google has policies 
that they post that, you know, developers are supposed to abide 
by, including, you know, checklists that developers check to 
say, my app is in compliance with COPPA. And that is pretty 
much the end of it. And so, I think that, you know, there 
should be some proactive auditing of apps.
    And actually, to their credit, it looks like Google is 
starting to shift in that way. I do not know if you saw their 
announcement, guess it was a week or two ago, where they are 
now following Apple's lead with the privacy nutrition labels. 
And if I remember correctly, I think one of the things that 
they mentioned in that statement about that program that they 
were going to be starting, was just that they might, you know, 
start including certifications from third-parties that have 
done privacy audits on apps. And so, I think that would, 
absolutely, be a step in the right direction.
    I mean, I think that--honestly, I think that this is an 
opportunity to actually have--you know, to create some robust 
competition around this by having, you know, private entities 
that have rigorous standards that are, you know, public and 
maybe regulated by the FTC. Because frankly, I think, if Google 
did say that, you know, they are changing their internal review 
processes, most people probably just would not believe them. 
And it would be hard to tell, as an outsider, what exactly they 
are doing. And so, I think that is why, you know, outside 
forces are necessary here.
    Senator Lujan. Appreciate that. Ms. Campbell, in your 2019 
testimony to Congress, you reported that the FTC had no formal 
process for parents to file complaints or obtain relief for 
COPPA violations. What is more, of the 14 requests you filed to 
the FTC to investigate COPPA violations, none have been 
responded to.
    Two questions--has any of that changed? And what can 
parents do when they suspect a child's data is being illegally 
collected?
    Ms. Campbell. Well, there is still no formal process of 
complaints. There is maybe some indication that the FTC is 
looking at these questions a little more. They did issue these 
6B investigative demands, so that they could understand better 
what is going on in the marketplace and what is happening to 
children. So, I think that is a positive step.
    But I think parents should complain. Just because there is 
no complaint form you need to fill out, does not mean you 
should not complain. You should definitely let them know what 
is happening and what your concerns are. And they can also get 
in touch with groups like Campaign for a Commercial Free 
Childhood and other groups that are working to try to get the 
government to be more responsive to protecting children.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you. And, Mr. Chairman, I do have some 
other questions, but I will submit them into the record for 
response, as well. And I just want to thank all the witnesses 
for their time today and the work that they are doing and their 
commitment to protecting children, as well.
    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you, Senator Lujan. I have just a 
few more questions and then, if the Ranking Member has some I 
will call on her.
    Dr. Egelman, last August, AppCensus, a research firm that 
you have helped to lead, discovered that women's health app, 
Premom, was sharing deeply sensitive health information with 
Chinese advertisers. Senator Klobuchar and I and a few other 
colleagues, sent a letter to the FTC urging it to investigate 
Premom. We are concerned that it is a privacy threat and a 
national security risk.
    These app stores are essentially the Wild West. Consumers 
have no way of knowing whether an app is child-safe or secretly 
selling data to Chinese data brokers. I would also mention my 
continued concerns about TikTok's deep links with China, as 
well as the FTC's deception case in 2020, against a subsidiary 
of the Chinese firm, Tencent. I suspect that a lot of these 
children's apps and digitally connected toys have substantial 
issues with sharing data to Chinese firms.
    From your research, how extensive is the problem of 
children's app developers sharing kids' personal data with 
Chinese firms?
    Mr. Egelman. That was actually how we started this line of 
research. That is a prescient question. When we--I mean, this 
whole thing with the children's apps specifically--you know, as 
I said I have been--my lab has been building instrumentation so 
that we can monitor mobile apps to see what they do. And in the 
course of that, we started, you know, playing with some kids' 
apps because there is law in that area that should be governing 
them.
    But one of the first ones we found was an app, I think, 
targeted at, like, five and under in the Google Play Store 
that, yes, had several, you know, trackers going to Chinese 
companies. And then, that is when we started digging deeper and 
found that this is relatively pervasive.
    The Premom finding that you mentioned, was actually pretty 
insidious because the way that they are transferring the data 
is likely to not be detected by most people examining the app. 
And so, you know, it is--it is hard to tell, in this particular 
case, and probably many other cases where, you know, apps are 
going--you know, apps are sending data to many of these third-
parties because, again, in some--you know, given--given how 
obfuscated these transmissions were, it is possible that app 
developers just have no idea that their apps are doing this.
    And I think that is part of the problem here is that the 
app developers--you know, I started to elude to this earlier, 
but I guess I did not finish that thought, which is just that, 
the compliance burden is put on the individual app developers. 
And there are, you know, millions of them, right? There are 
millions of apps.
    But most of the concerning uses of the data here are, you 
know, going to data aggregators and advertising companies and 
there are comparatively fewer of those. And they are the ones 
who actually, you know, control the data and, you know, have 
the ability to use it for, you know, these harmful things.
    And so, you know, that is one advantage of switching to the 
constructive knowledge standard, which is, that shifts the 
compliance burden to those third-parties, substantially. And 
they are in the best position to actually do the enforcement 
here to, you know, shut off, you know, those data flows. And if 
they do not then, you know, action should be taken against 
them. Because they know what apps are sending them the data, 
even if the app developers do not know that the data is being 
sent to them.
    Senator Blumenthal. Well, who would those third-parties be?
    Mr. Egelman. You know, the makers of third-party components 
like, you know, Facebook has components in--I might need to 
correct this exact number, but it is on the order of, like, 30 
to 40 percent of the apps that we have looked at have Facebook 
code in them, which gives them the ability to send data to 
Facebook. And you know, Facebook's SDK, software development 
kit, is the, you know, premade components that developers 
download and stick in their apps. It is----
    Senator Blumenthal. You would shift the burden?
    Mr. Egelman. Yes, it would shift the burden to 
organizations like Facebook.
    Senator Blumenthal. They have not only the visibility----
    Mr. Egelman. Yep.
    Senator Blumenthal.--but also, the resources.
    Mr. Egelman. Exactly.
    Senator Blumenthal. And they have the resources to 
compensate women whose data is shared, without their knowledge 
and consent, violating their privacy, potentially leading to 
exploitation of them, for harms that are done, correct?
    Mr. Egelman. Yes.
    Senator Blumenthal. So, they should be held accountable--
Facebook.
    Mr. Egelman. Absolutely. And all of the other--I mean, 
Facebook it is--you know, Facebook is big and, you know, they 
have user facing services. But there are also, you know, lots 
of these companies that most consumers have never heard of 
before, that are also collecting, you know, large amounts of 
data from children and adults, often without, you know, the 
consumer's knowledge. And also, often without the app 
developer's knowledge because they might have misconfigured 
something, or it is just really obfuscated and intentionally 
trying to deceive the app developer.
    Senator Blumenthal. And we cannot depend on the FTC to do 
it alone.
    Mr. Egelman. No, I mean, like, this is--the big problem is, 
you know, again, the FTC does a lot of really good work and 
they have knowledgeable people. But they bring less than two 
cases a year, because they just do not have the resources. I 
mean, unless we are going to entertain----
    Senator Blumenthal. Even if we give them the resources.
    Mr. Egelman. Right, well, I mean, even if you entertain 
giving them, like, a DOD style, you know, size budget, like, I 
still do not think the problem is going to be fully, you know, 
under control. I think that, you know, there are a lot of 
different facets here and, you know, these are complicated 
problems.
    Senator Blumenthal. So, we ought to give the FTC more 
resources?
    Mr. Egelman. Yes, absolutely.
    Senator Blumenthal. That is a thumbs up.
    Mr. Egelman. Yes, absolutely.
    Senator Blumenthal. But even with those additional 
resources, we need other means of holding Facebook and the tech 
platforms accountable?
    Mr. Egelman. Yes--yes, because right now, without the 
resources to, you know, bring cases, it is essentially an 
unfunded mandate.
    Senator Blumenthal. Exactly. Let me ask you, Professor 
Campbell, about influencer guidelines. I know you have done a 
lot of work on this issue. The FTC released guidelines for 
online influencers. You know how pervasive their impact can be 
on kids. But these guidelines failed to sufficiently address 
the advertising that is targeted to children, nor are they 
fully enforced. Numerous unboxing videos on YouTube are, in 
actuality, people paid to promote toys, games, and other 
products to unsuspecting children.
    I am encouraged by the FTC's request for comments on its 
endorsement guidelines, but I think a lot more has to be done. 
And I have repeatedly raised my concerns to the FTC that these 
influencers are manipulating and targeting children, and often 
pushing dangerous products. Tell me what you think need to be 
made in the FTC's influencer guidelines?
    Ms. Campbell. Yes, I agree with you. In my testimony, I 
talk about how, on YouTube, three of the top five channels 
viewed in the U.S. are targeted at children and they feature 
child influencers. And so, these kids make lots of money. Not 
all kids make lots of money, but these--you know, the top ones 
really make a lot of money and sometimes they are promoting, 
you know, sugary cereals or candy. And other times, they are 
promoting toys--that is what a lot of the unboxing videos are 
about--or even promoting their own lines of products, as in the 
case with, I think her name is, Diana. And I included a picture 
in the--in my testimony where she--it is a 10-minute video and 
then, she--she becomes a doll, herself, that you can then buy 
online.
    So, it is a big problem. And the FTC--the problem is--one 
is largely enforcement. I mean, this is a huge business, and 
the FTC just is not enforcing its guidelines, as it is. But the 
other thing is, when they do--and they have not brought any 
cases involving children--programming directed at children. 
When they do bring cases, they--they merely require that the 
sponsorship be disclosed. And that is problematic for kids 
because--well, first on, you can hardly see the sponsorship 
identifications, if they are even there. Especially when you 
are looking at, like, TikTok where there are, like, 25 
different hashtags and one will say #ad.
    But they also just do not really understand that the 
purpose of these videos is to sell products. I mean, for little 
children, they think that EvanTube and Ryan and Diana are their 
friends. And they--you know, they do not--they have the--they 
enter into what is called a parasocial relationship with these 
actual children--child celebrities as well as spokes 
characters--you know, cartoon celebrities that are popular with 
children. And so, they really cannot--they just do not have the 
cognitive capacity to fend against that, even if they are told 
it is advertising. Of course, a lot of them cannot read, 
either.
    So, I think the Commission needs to clearly recognize that, 
and say for kids that do not have this capacity, you just 
cannot have this kind of programming. It is not enough just to 
disclose it.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you. You know, I think that 
parents often are unaware of the impacts of this kind of 
manipulative advertising on children. Last week, the Center for 
Digital Democracy released a report describing how Big Tech is 
helping to fuel the childhood obesity crisis. Junk food, e-
cigarettes, vaping--they have all been pushed to children, 
targeted to them. Tech platforms are harvesting troves of 
information that enable targeting of children by companies that 
produce these products.
    It is not just junk food. In fact, the e-cigarette company, 
Juul, bought ads across sites like ``Cartoon Network'' and 
``Seventeen'' magazine to target young audiences. This 
innovative and absolutely reckless tracking and targeting of 
children is a real public health menace.
    How is it that data collected from kids' apps is fueling 
these sophisticated ad campaigns and profiling to push these 
harmful products?
    Ms. Campbell. Well, I think one of the biggest problems is 
that the whole process of collection and how the data is used 
is not transparent, at all, and it is very complicated. And 
most people do not understand it, myself including. I would say 
I do not fully understand it. But I do know that, if you do not 
know it is happening--and then, as a parent, you know, if your 
child is using their tablet, or their computer, for schoolwork 
or a phone, they are not seeing what the child is seeing. And 
yet, there is--so, they do not know about it and of course, 
they have not been asked.
    When we were looking into apps on the Google Play Store, 
that were in the Designed for Families program, we found that a 
lot of them had advertising for things like gambling, for 
alcohol, and also, just things that really were not appropriate 
for children. So, I--did I answer your question?
    Senator Blumenthal. You did. Both of you have filed 
substantive complaints to the FTC about violations of COPPA. As 
you observed, I think, Mr. Egelman, in the last 21 years, only 
34 COPPA cases have been filed by the FTC. That is plainly a 
lack of enforcement that may be due to lack of resources. But 
it also may be due to lack of will or vigor, in some 
administration. And my hope is that we will see an end to, what 
you have called, rampant non-compliance. I would call it the 
Wild West. And like the Wild West, it is increasingly perilous 
to kids and my hope is that the FTC will be a stronger and more 
vigorous partner in enforcement going forward.
    I want to thank all of the panel. Thank you, Baroness. 
Thank you to both of you present here today. This has been a 
very valuable session and on behalf of my colleagues, we 
express our gratitude to you and keep up the good work. Thank 
you.
    This record will remain open for a week. A number of 
colleagues have indicated they want to submit additional 
questions and for now, it is closed. Thank you.
    [Whereupon, at 11:46 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ben Ray Lujan to 
                           Angela J. Campbell
    Senator Lujan wrote:
    In your testimony, you make the point that overuse of digital media 
among children has been associated with mental health problems, poor 
nutrition, problems in school, cyberbullying, and online sexual abuse. 
Facebook has justified the creation of Instagram for Kids by pointing 
to the fact that a majority of kids 8 to 13 are already using social 
media. Instead of addressing the problem, Facebook has decided to 
capitalize on the problem. Instagram for Kids won't reduce the number 
of young children using social media. Instead, by design it will 
encourage them to start using it at younger and younger ages.
    Question. What implications does lowering the age at which children 
are first exposed to social media have on their development?
    Answer. Thank you for asking this very important question. Lowering 
the age at which children are first exposed to social media would harm 
children's development and well-being.
    The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), and 
the FTC rules implementing COPPA, are intended to prevent the 
collection, use and disclosure of personal information from children 
under age 13 except in very limited circumstances.\1\ Consequently, 
most social media platforms have terms of service stating that they are 
intended only for persons aged 13 or older. These platforms were 
designed for adults to maximize engagement, such as likes, shares, and 
comments. They were not been designed to serve the best interests of 
children.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Nonetheless, many children under age 13 use social media platforms 
designed for adults such as Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Snapchat, 
as well as gaming and other platforms that allow communication among 
strangers.\2\ Children can easily evade getting parental consent simply 
by giving a false birthdate.\3\ Creating Instagram for Children will 
not solve this problem. Underage children currently using Instagram are 
unlikely to switch to children's accounts.\4\ Rather, the effect will 
be to encourage the creation of new accounts by even more younger 
children.

Fortnite games ``players' blocky avatars simulate sex, engage in 
raunchy talk and `date' other avatars.'')
    \3\ For example, after the United States filed a complaint alleging 
TikTok violated COPPA by permitting children under 13 to use the 
service without parental notice and consent and TikTok signed a consent 
agreement requiring it to comply with COPPA, TikTok created accounts 
for U.S. users under 13 that allowed children to make videos using 
their phones but not to share them with others. A subsequent 
investigation by Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood found that 
many children under 13 were continuing to post videos of themselves on 
TikTok without their parents' knowledge or consent. Advocates Say

report finds, as the tech giant considers building an Instagram app for 
kids, Business Insider (May 13, 2021). Similarly, YouTube's creation of 
YouTube Kids had limited if any effect on the large number of children 
using YouTube, but did lead to new accounts for the youngest children.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While COPPA would require that Instagram for Kids give direct 
notice of its privacy practices to parents and obtain advance 
verifiable consent from parents, this does not protect young children 
from the many risks presented by social media. Privacy policies are not 
required to disclose the risks,\5\ and parents are often unaware of 
them. Most parents do not have the time or ability to research and 
assess the risks, or to monitor all their children's online activities. 
And even if parents do everything reasonably possible to protect their 
child, they still may not succeed. For example, the Wall Street Journal 
describes a case in which a parent read Roblox's parental guide and set 
up an account specifically for a child under 13, but the child was 
still exposed to inappropriate sexual content.\6\ Moreover, an online 
service designed for children could have a design flaw allowing young 
children to circumvent parental controls. This actually happened with 
Facebook's Messenger Kids in 2019, when a design flaw enabled children 
to chat with strangers.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ 16 CFR Sec. 312.4 generally requires operators only to make 
reasonable efforts to give parents notice of their practices with 
regard to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information

    Using social media poses many risks for children. The very purpose 
of social media is for individuals to share information with others. 
Social media provides opportunities to exchange information with anyone 
online. Generally, parents and society protect young children by 
limiting their contacts with unknown persons and by providing schools 
and other environments designed to promote healthy development.
    Social media undermines these efforts by allowing unknown 
individuals to communicate directly with children and companies to use, 
sell and make available to third-parties information collected from 
children. Often, such information is personally identifiable. It may 
include names, physical or e-mail addresses, geolocation, telephone 
numbers, photographs, videos or audio recordings. Social media networks 
and other digital platforms constantly track what users do online, 
which can provide a wealth of information on such sensitive topics as 
mood, likes and dislikes, political opinions, medical concerns, and 
sexual orientation. Advertisers can use this information to target 
manipulative advertisements. Photographs posted online can be 
``scraped'' and used for facial recognition by almost anyone.\8\ 
Personal data can be bought and sold, combined, and mined to reveal all 
sorts of insights about individuals, which can be used for harmful 
purposes.

    As discussed below, a large body of research, mostly involving 
teens, associates social media use with a variety of negative outcomes 
including depression and anxiety, cyberbullying, sleep problems, 
unhealthy body images, and sexual abuse. Given that younger children 
are still developing their cognitive, social, and emotional skills, 
they are even more vulnerable to these risks than adolescents.
Children are even more vulnerable than teens to the risks posed by 
        social media
    During early and mid-childhood, children develop basic motor, 
cognitive, and social skills, which are crucial for further 
development. Cognitive functions include memory, attention, visual-
spatial, and executive functions, while complex cognitive processes 
include: thinking (abstract, cause and effect, creative thinking, and 
planning) and language functions. The most intensive development of all 
components of executive functions, especially cognitive flexibility, 
happens at school age, usually between 7 and 12 years of age.\9\ Until 
children have developed these capacities, they simply are not able 
understand the risks of using social media. For example, children 
between the ages of 4 and 10 show limited understanding of digital 
privacy concepts, such as what companies might know about them.\10\

Threats to children's developing self-esteem
    Social media usage by children may undermine their developing sense 
of self-esteem. Self-esteem is shaped not only by a child's own 
perceptions and expectations, but also by the perceptions and 
expectations of significant people in her life--how she is thought of 
and treated by parents, teachers and friends.\11\ Social media 
generally, and Instagram in particular, with its focus on photo sharing 
and appearance, are unsuitable for children in the crucial stages of 
developing their sense of self. Social media platforms encourage users 
to upload videos and photos and to make and receive likes and comments 
from other users. This can lead young people to obsessively check for 
reactions to their posts, or to post even more outrageous or 
inappropriate content to garner more reactions.

Healthy Sense of Self Esteem, https://www.healthychildren.org/English/
ages-stages/ gradeschool/Pages/Helping-Your-Child-Develop-A-Healthy-
Sense-of-Self-Esteem.aspx.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition, editing photos and videos and using filters to present 
an idealized version of oneself is the norm on Instagram and many other 
social media platforms. The constant pressure to compare themselves to 
others is likely to have detrimental effects on children. As clinical 
psychologist Bethany Cook notes:

        social media--especially Instagram--allows us control over what 
        we share with the outside world. Many of us prefer to show our 
        ``best light'' and/or a ``filtered'' version of our life. When 
        children see this version of life and then compare it to their 
        own, it often creates feelings of anger, frustrations, 
        resentment, depression, and stress they don't know how to 
        emotionally process on their own. It doesn't matter if you 
        explain to them ``it's all fake,'' because the part of their 
        brain needed to fully comprehend and understand this concept 
        isn't fully developed until around the age 21-25.\12\

Increased risk of depression and anxiety
    Depression and anxiety among children and teens have increased in 
recent years.\13\ Increased depressive symptoms and rising suicide 
rates have been correlated with increasing use of smart phones and 
social media. For example, a 2020 review of ``evidence from a variety 
of cross-sectional, longitudinal and empirical studies implicate 
smartphone and social media use in the increase in mental distress, 
self-injurious behaviour and suicidality among youth.'' \14\ Another 
study analyzed three large data sets (two from the U.S. and one from 
the UK) and found that ``Adolescents using digital media an hour or 
less a day reported the highest levels of well-being, and those using 
digital media 5 or more hours a day reported the lowest levels of well-
being.'' \15\ A longitudinal study of 7,596 UK children aged 10 to 15 
found that that ``high use of social media was significantly associated 
with a decrease in happiness, and that girls, in particular, 
experienced the largest decline in happiness and were more likely to 
have a worsening trajectory over time.\16\

12-to-14-year-old girls killed themselves in 2015 as in 2007, compared 
with twice as many boys. The suicide rate is still higher for boys, in 
part because they use more-lethal methods, but girls are beginning to

14-24 year-olds in the UK about the five most popular social media 
platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter and YouTube. Those 
surveyed reported that four of the five social media platforms actually 
made their feelings of anxiety worse.\17\ The survey concluded that 
Instagram was the worst social media platform for youth mental health. 
A U.S. organization, BARK, analyzed more than 2.1 billion messages in 
2020, including texts, YouTube, e-mails and over thirty different 
social media networks. It found that ``41.4 percent of tweens and 66.6 
percent of teens were involved in a self-harm/suicidal situation,'' 
which included anything from text messages about cutting to an e-mail 
draft of a suicide note.\18\ It also found that the top 2 platforms 
flagged for severe suicidal ideation were Twitter and Instagram.\19\

Cyberbullying
    Many mental health problems of youth are related to cyberbullying. 
As explained by the RSPH:

        Bullying during childhood is a major risk factor for a number 
        of issues including mental health, education and social 
        relationships, with long-lasting effects often carried right 
        through to adulthood. The rise of social media has meant that 
        children and young people are in almost constant contact with 
        each other. The school day is filled with face-to-face 
        interaction, and time at home is filled with contact through 
        social media platforms. There is very little time spent 
        uncontactable for today's young people. While much of this 
        interaction is positive, it also presents opportunities for 
        bullies to continue their abuse even when not physically near 
        an individual.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \20\ #StatusofMind at 11 (footnotes omitted).

    The RSPH survey found that 7 in 10 young people had experienced 
cyberbullying, with 37 percent of young people saying they experienced 
cyberbullying on a high-frequency basis. Similarly, a survey of U.S. 
teens by the Pew Research Center, found that 59 percent of U.S. teens 
reported being bullied on social media.\21\ Cyberbullying is 
particularly rampant on Instagram.\22\

Detrimental Impacts on Sleep
    Social media use also affects sleep, which is related to mental 
health. As the RSPH notes,

        Poor mental health can lead to poor sleep and poor sleep can 
        lead to states of poor mental health. Sleep is particularly 
        important for teens and young adults due to this being a key 
        time for development. The brain is not fully developed until a 
        person is well into their twenties and thirties. Sleep is 
        essential for allowing us to function properly during waking 
        hours and teens need around 1-2 hours more sleep every night 
        than adults. Poor sleep is linked to a wide range of both 
        physical and mental health conditions in adults including high 
        blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, heart attack, stroke and 
        depression.\23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \23\ #StatusofMind at 9 (footnotes omitted).

    Numerous studies show that social media usage can decrease the 
quantity and quality of sleep. For example, a survey of 11,361 teens 
aged 13-15 in the UK found that ``heavy use of screen media was 
associated with shorter sleep duration, longer sleep latency, and more 
mid-sleep awakenings.'' These associations were strongest for teens 
using screen media to engage in social media or to use the internet.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhealthy body image
    Body image is a concern for many young people, especially girls. 
The RSPH found that 9 in 10 teenage girls are unhappy with their 
body.\25\ A study of girls in middle and high school found that 
frequently posting on Facebook was ``significantly correlated with 
weight dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, thin ideal internalization 
and self-objectification.'' \26\ Interviews with children aged 11-16 in 
three European countries revealed that adolescent girls felt pressured 
to post sexualized selfies as a means of generating attention and 
social acceptance from their peers.\27\ A survey of close to 300 girls 
between the ages of 12 and 16 in Singapore found that ``girls place 
high importance on both the number of likes and positive comments they 
receive. The findings also indicate that teenage girls with low self-
esteem attach higher importance to peer feedback, and the level of such 
importance is positively associated with depressed mood.'' \28\ 
Relatedly, most social media platforms have communities that promote 
anorexia and other eating disorders.\29\

Online sexual abuse
    Another serious risk to young people on social media is exposure to 
child sexual abuse materials. Social media platforms including 
Instagram are rife with images and videos portraying child sexual 
abuse. In 2019, nearly 70 million such images and videos were reported 
to the National Center for Missing and Exploited children (NCMEC), 
representing an increase of more than 50 percent from 2018.\30\ Of 
reports filed with NCMEC by US-based electronic service providers, the 
vast proportion came from Facebook, which owns Instagram.\31\

    Not only are children exposed to sexual images on social media, but 
they are often solicited to engage in sexual interactions. While 
different studies may use different terminology, there is no doubt that 
many young people are groomed by adults online for sexual purposes.\32\ 
NCMEC, for example, reports receiving 19,174 ``online enticement 
reports'' in 2019, and almost twice that number (37,872) in 2020.\33\

    \32\ For example, ECPAT International, a global network of more 
than 100 civil society organizations working to end the sexual 
exploitation of children, has identified five different types of online

grooming; sexting; sexual extortion and live online child sexual abuse.

    \33\ NCMEC explains that ``Online Enticement involves an individual 
communicating with someone believed to be a child via the Internet with 
the intent to commit a sexual offense or abduction. This is a broad 
category of online exploitation and includes sextortion, in which a 
child is being groomed to take sexually explicit images and/or 
ultimately meet face-to-face with someone for sexual purposes, or to 
engage in a sexual conversation online or, in some instances, to sell/
trade the child's sexual images. This type of victimization takes place 
across every platform; social media, messaging apps, gaming platforms, 
etc.'' Online Enticement, https://www.missingkids.org/theissues/
onlineenticement.

        continuing to produce sexual material and/or told to perform 
        distressing acts under threat of exposure to others of the 
        material. In some instances, the abuse spirals so out of 
        control that victims have attempted to self-harm or commit 
        suicide as the only way of escaping it.\34\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \34\ A Common Understanding, supra n. 32.

    Thorn, a nonprofit organization that develops new technologies to 
combat online child sexual abuse, conducted surveys of victims of 
sextortion in 2015 and 2017. Its 2017 survey of more than 2,000 victims 
aged 13 to 25 found that nearly a quarter were 13 years or younger when 
the sextortion occurred.\35\ It also found that younger victims were 
more likely to experience sextortion from online offenders (as opposed 
to someone they knew offline) and to be threatened for explicit 
imagery.\36\ In another survey conducted in 2020 of 1,000 minors aged 
9-17, Thorn found that a third reported having had an online sexual 
interaction.\37\ The majority of these harmful interactions took place 
on popular platforms such as Snapchat (26 percent), Instagram (26 
percent), YouTube (19 percent), TikTok (18 percent), and Messenger (18 
percent).\38\

offenses of sexual communications with a child over a 3-month period 
(Apr.1 to June 30, 2020), found that Instagram was involved in more 
offenses (37 percent) than any other platform, while Facebook-owned 
apps (including Instagram) were used in 51 percent of reported cases.

    Online sexual abuse can have significant and lasting effects. 
Victims of child abuse are more likely to suffer from mental health 
problems, attempt and commit suicide, and develop alcohol or drug 
dependencies. These outcomes impact every aspect of a child's life, 
including their ability to develop into productive adults.'' \39\

    \39\ In addition, the impacts of online child sexual exploitation 
and abuse extend into the economics sphere, including expenditures by 
health care systems that treat children for short-and long-term 
injuries; costs associated with treating psychological and behavioral 
problems, costs incurred by social welfare systems involved with 
monitoring, preventing and responding to cases of violence against 
children; and costs associated with finding, persecuting and jailing 
perpetrators of child violence through the criminal justice system.

    Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Ben Ray Lujan to 
                          Serge Egelman, Ph.D.
    Implications of security and privacy breaches in a platform 
designed for kids. Facebook says that Instagram for Kids can be 
designed to protect children online. But given their history, there is 
reason to be concerned. In a recent open letter, the National 
Association of Attorneys General cited Facebook's long history of 
failing to protect the safety and privacy of children online. Facebook 
has built privacy controls before, but design flaws have repeatedly 
exposed their users to unsafe and vulnerable situations.

    Question. What are the implications of security and privacy 
breaches in a product designed exclusively for children?
    Answer. When the privacy and security of children's products are 
breached, there are numerous implications. One concern is unauthorized 
access to the collected identifiable data. For example, child predators 
may see these services as attractive targets; they may break into 
children's accounts in order to perform reconnaissance on potential 
victims. Another concern is the public disclosure of the data in the 
event of a data breach or due to indiscriminate sharing of the data 
with third parties (e.g., anyone may be able to buy the data from data 
brokers). In this manner, children's data may still end up in the hands 
of child predators, who then may use it to identify and locate victims, 
and then use their knowledge of each child's interests to lure them.
    The data being used by child predators to identify and lure 
potential abuse victims represents an extreme, albeit feasible, use of 
this type of data. A much more likely scenario is the situation where a 
non-custodial parent (or someone else known to the child) breaks into a 
child's account to plan a kidnapping or coordinate prohibited 
communication. Incidents occur all the time where account compromise 
and an unaccountable data broker ecosystem enable domestic abusers to 
stalk and abuse their victims, there is no reason to believe that these 
same tactics will not be used against children.
    A related concern is that because proving identity is very 
difficult on the Internet--it is considered an open problem and is why 
social engineering attacks are so prevalent (e.g., phishing)--it is 
difficult for services targeted at children to guarantee that their 
users are actually children, and not adults pretending to be children. 
I am not aware of a good solution to this problem: even if the service 
could somehow prove that a child initially created an account, they 
cannot easily prove that that child continues to control the account 
(as opposed to it being controlled by an adult). Thus, even if the 
accounts of child users are not compromised by predators directly, 
child users may still be targeted by child predators who use accounts 
to pose as children so that they can identify victims, communicate with 
them, and/or arrange to meet them. There is not a good technological 
solution to this problem, which continues to plague many online 
platforms.
