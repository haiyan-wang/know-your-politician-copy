                        THURSDAY, JUNE 23, 2022

                                       U.S. Senate,
                            Committee on Foreign Relations,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:22 a.m., in 
Room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Edward J. 
Markey presiding.
    Present: Senators Markey [presiding], Cardin, Shaheen, 
Murphy, Kaine, Booker, Johnson, and Portman.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD J. MARKEY,
                U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS

    Senator Markey. This nomination hearing of the Senator 
Foreign Relations Committee will come to order.
    We are here today to consider the nominees before us: Ms. 
Elizabeth Shortino to serve as United States Executive Director 
of the International Monetary Fund; the Honorable David 
Pressman to serve as Ambassador to Hungary; the Honorable 
Geoffrey Pyatt to serve as Assistant Secretary of State for 
Energy Resources; and the Honorable Robert Wood to serve as 
Alternate Representative for Special Political Affairs in the 
United Nations.
    I would like to congratulate each of you on your 
nominations. We thank you for your service.
    We thank your families, who have served and will continue 
to serve beside you as you embark on your new post.
    Elizabeth Shortino is nominated to be the United States 
Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund. Ms. 
Shortino has spent 17 years as a dedicated public servant at 
the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of 
Treasury.
    Since February of 2021, Ms. Shortino has served as the 
acting U.S. Executive Director at the International Monetary 
Fund. U.S. leadership at the IMF will be crucial as Russia's 
unprovoked war against Ukraine rages on, further straining 
Ukraine's economy and jeopardizing global economic growth.
    Next, Ambassador David Pressman, nominated to be Ambassador 
to Hungary. Ambassador Pressman previously served as U.S. 
Ambassador to the United Nations for Special Political Affairs.
    Ambassador Pressman is a prominent international human 
rights lawyer. This experience will serve him well as 
Ambassador to Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban 
continues to serve as a foe of democratic institutions and 
human rights.
    In this role, we will rely on you to champion the 
restoration of checks and balances, support for an independent 
media, and support for LGBTQI rights that have come under 
assault under the Orban government.
    Next, Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt, nominated to be Assistant 
Secretary of State for Energy Resources. Ambassador Pyatt is a 
dedicated public servant, having served most recently as 
Ambassador to Greece and before that Ambassador to Ukraine.
    The Assistant Secretary for Energy Resources will be a 
crucial part of the Administration's efforts to lead a clean 
energy revolution.
    We need to cut fossil fuel demand and deploy renewable and 
energy efficient technologies in order to provide real long-
term security for ourselves and for our allies.
    As President Biden works to take short-term steps to 
support Europe in the face of war and disruption, I urge the 
Administration to continue to direct investments, funding, and 
private sector collaborations towards the renewable energy and 
electrification solutions that will keep Americans and our 
allies and partners safe, healthy, and supplied with affordable 
energy.
    Ambassador Pyatt, I look forward to hearing how you will 
advance those goals as Assistant Secretary.
    And finally, I would like to introduce Ambassador Robert 
Wood, who is nominated to be the Alternate Representative for 
Special Political Affairs at the United Nations.
    Ambassador Wood has extensive experience with multilateral 
bodies from his time as the U.S. Ambassador to the Conference 
on Disarmament, Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. mission to 
the European Union, and Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. 
mission of international organizations in Vienna, Austria.
    We welcome you as well, Ambassador Wood, and as we continue 
to navigate the pressing challenges to the international 
community posed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and North 
Korea's continued illicit development of weapons of mass 
destruction, we need to ensure that voice at the United Nations 
remains strong.
    We have to continue to build coalitions even as Russia and 
China continue to serve as spoilers within the United Nations 
Security Council.
    Congratulations to each of you on your nomination to serve 
in these crucial posts.
    Now let me turn and recognize the ranking member today, 
Senator Portman from Ohio.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. ROB PORTMAN,
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM OHIO

    Senator Portman. Thank you, Senator Markey, and thank you 
for your perfect timing. I apologize for being a couple minutes 
late. We are all juggling all of our commitments this morning.
    But I am delighted to be here and particularly with these 
nominees. Thank you all for being willing to serve our country.
    We were just told by Senator Markey something about your 
background so I will not go into that except to say that all of 
you are looking to join the ranks of some very important 
responsibilities.
    Elizabeth Shortino to be at IMF--I look forward to talking 
to you about that; Ambassador David Pressman, U.S. Ambassador 
to Hungary; Geoffrey Pyatt, who I got to know when he was 
ambassador in Ukraine, to be Assistant Secretary of State for 
Energy Resources; and Ambassador Robert Wood at the U.N.
    This is a critical time--I guess we always say that--in 
global affairs, but I think it is not an overstatement to say 
that right now it is particularly difficult because it is a 
time of great instability, which requires U.S. leadership, in 
my view, on the world stage.
    The positions you have been nominated to are all very 
important and maybe now more than ever.
    Ambassador Pyatt, energy security, as you know, is of 
critical importance as Russia continues to wage this war 
against Ukraine. Eight hundred and seventy million dollars a 
day is about what the Europeans are sending to Russia to help 
fund the war machine and so we need to see a change there. We 
are seeing it slowly, more quickly if the United States has an 
even stronger leadership role.
    Unfortunately, it took us a while to work with the EU to 
get them to make any moves, but they have embargoed Russian 
coal now, which will take effect in mid-August, as you know, 
and then they are phasing in this embargo on Russian oil.
    I would like to hear from you today, of course, about how 
we can be more helpful to accelerate Europe's independence from 
Russia.
    Strong concerns with our energy policies here at home 
because I do not think they are helping right now, and so we 
need to do what we can to increase production in this country 
rather than rely on the Venezuelas and Saudi Arabias even and, 
certainly, the Iranian sources to backfill our own energy 
needs.
    Ambassador Pressman, Hungary has found itself in the middle 
of these conversations about European energy security and 
energy independence from Russia. They were a particularly 
difficult partner to deal with during Europe's attempts to 
agree to ban Russian oil. In fact, the compromise was required 
because of them.
    I have concerns with the influence of Russia and China in 
Hungary and I would like to hear from you today about the 
dynamic and ways in which the United States can work to counter 
this and the ways in which you personally would work to do so.
    Ambassador Wood, no shortage of global issues before the 
Security Council--as was noted, Russia's illegal invasion of 
Ukraine, the global food and energy crises. Multiple 
humanitarian disasters have confirmed your plate will be full.
    I want to talk to you about what your priorities will be at 
the U.N., if confirmed, and how you plan to work with our 
partners and allies there to pursue those priorities.
    And we do have a lot of allies, and it turns out that 
Vladimir Putin's brutal and unwarranted attack on Ukraine has 
strengthened some of those alliances. I note that the NATO 
meeting coming up will have the heads of state from countries 
like South Korea and Japan and Australia and New Zealand 
attending.
    Although they are not expanding NATO they are, in effect, 
expanding its reach by allying with us so closely.
    Ms. Shortino, inflation and energy prices continue to climb 
upwards. Of course, this is impacting us here at home but also 
impacting emerging and developing countries around the world 
and to compound that, of course, we have a sovereign country, 
Ukraine, that needs to be rebuilt.
    I am interested--really interested in talking to you about 
that. I think that IMF can play a central role. Following on 
the $40 billion dollar package that Senator Markey and I 
supported to help Ukraine, I would hope that the IMF can play a 
bigger role, going forward, to help Ukraine get back on its 
feet.
    I would like to thank you all for being here, again, and, 
again, for stepping forward to serve your country and we look 
forward to hearing from you.
    Senator Markey. Thank you, Senator Portman.
    And now we will turn to our opening statements from our 
witnesses. I would ask each of you to keep your statements to 
five minutes.
    And we will begin with you, Ms. Shortino. Whenever you feel 
comfortable, please begin.

 STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH SHORTINO OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, 
    NOMINATED TO BE UNITED STATES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE 
      INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND FOR A TERM OF TWO YEARS

    Ms. Shortino. Thank you so much, Chairman Markey, and 
Ranking Member Portman and members of the committee. I am truly 
honored that President Biden has nominated me to serve as 
Executive Director of the United States to the International 
Monetary Fund.
    I am also thankful for the support of Vice President 
Harris, Secretary Yellen, and Deputy Secretary Adeyemo.
    I am very pleased to be joined today by my husband, Michael 
Shortino, my mother, Peggy Demarest, and my son, Alex Shortino, 
behind me.
    I have spent the last 17 years of my career working in 
international affairs for the U.S. Government, serving 
administrations from both parties to advance U.S. economic 
interests.
    My interest in public service took hold during my years at 
the University of North Carolina where I majored in political 
science. Following graduation, I took a position in management 
consulting.
    But after four years of working on business strategy I was 
drawn to public service. As a graduate student at the Johns 
Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, I developed a 
passion for international economics and diplomacy and, 
specifically, the role of the Bretton Woods Institutions in the 
global economic order.
    I formally began my career in federal service at the Office 
of Management and Budget, overseeing State Department and USAID 
economic and development assistance programs.
    Four years later, I made the transition to the Treasury 
Department in the midst of the global financial crisis. My 
career at Treasury has spanned a wide range of international 
topics that have all, on some level, involved the use of IMF 
engagement to advance U.S. interests.
    As an economist working on Pakistan, I worked closely with 
the State Department, Defense Department, and USAID to leverage 
the IMF and enhancing U.S. national security interests in the 
region.
    As the director of the Office of the Middle East and North 
Africa, I developed strong relationships with IMF staff and 
partnered with the IMF to design lending programs that would 
support Arab Spring countries in their economic transitions.
    Later, as director of the International Monetary Policy 
Office, I led Treasury's engagement on IMF policies, IMF 
lending, and G-7 and G-20. I also spearheaded the U.S. agenda 
for the G-7 during its presidency in 2020 and oversaw the IMF 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
    The IMF has a pivotal role to play in supporting the global 
economy. It is truly a unique organization in its ability to 
rapidly mobilize support for countries in crisis.
    In response to the COVID-19 crisis, it mobilized $33 
billion in emergency financing. More recently, it approved $1.4 
billion in rapid financing to support Ukraine.
    Its engagement often provides a catalytic effect. Its sound 
policy advice and robust economic lending conditions can unlock 
other international support and market financing, and 
facilitate critical transitions towards a stable and growing 
economic outlook.
    It is the only international institution charged with 
assessing exchange rate stability and global economic 
imbalances, and its capacity development programs are of the 
highest caliber and provide much needed support, particularly 
for low income and fragile states.
    While the IMF has many strengths, it also faces challenges. 
It is an organization that boasts a broad and diverse 
membership, and leveraging the IMF's toolkit to advance U.S. 
interests requires active engagement with IMF management and 
other board members.
    Its lending programs need to incorporate measures to 
strengthen governance by corruption and bolster anti-money 
laundering frameworks, which will help ensure that IMF funds 
and other funds are used appropriately.
    With low income countries facing rising debt challenges 
compounded by the increase in energy and food prices, the IMF 
has a significant role to play to support its poorest members.
    If confirmed as U.S. Executive Director, I will work 
tirelessly to help ensure the IMF delivers on these future 
challenges while still executing its core mission.
    Building upon my experience, I will press for the IMF to 
call out unfair and opaque Chinese lending as part of its 
broader efforts to promote debt sustainability. I will ensure 
that U.S. interests are protected in the next review of IMF 
quota and governance reform, which is scheduled to conclude in 
2023.
    I will take steps to make sure IMF lending is in line with 
and supports U.S. national and economic goals, including 
fighting corruption and money laundering.
    Finally, I will work to improve the operational 
effectiveness of the IMF as an institution. I look forward to 
regularly engaging with the U.S. Congress and this committee on 
all of these issues, and I would be honored to have the 
opportunity to serve in this role.
    I look forward to your questions today. Thank you.

                Prepared Statement of Elizabeth Shortino

    Thank you, Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Risch, and members of 
the committee. I am honored that President Biden nominated me to serve

    Senator Markey. Thank you very much.
    Now we will turn to you, Mr. Pressman, for your testimony.

 STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID PRESSMAN OF NEW YORK, NOMINATED TO BE 
  AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED 
                       STATES TO HUNGARY

    Mr. Pressman. Chairman Markey, Ranking Member Portman, 
distinguished members of the committee, it is an honor to 
return to this committee as the President's nominee to serve as 
United States Ambassador in Hungary.
    I am grateful to President Biden and to Secretary Blinken 
for the opportunity, if confirmed, to join the exceptional team 
of public servants at Embassy Budapest at this time of enormous 
complexity and urgency.
    As you know, we meet against a backdrop of rising 
authoritarianism and democratic backsliding around the world.
    Vladimir Putin has once again attacked a sovereign 
democratic neighbor, flouting the rules-based international 
order and challenging the institutions that America and its 
partners stood up to protect it, including the United Nations 
Security Council where I previously served as the United States 
ambassador.
    Even for someone who has spent much of my career focused on 
the worst humanity has to offer--national security threats, 
human rights abuses, war crimes--the carnage Putin continues to 
wreak in Ukraine is staggering.
    But where Putin expected weakness he has found strength. 
The Ukrainian people's courage and determination, to borrow the 
words of a former president, has, quote, ``lit a candle of hope 
and inspiration, reminding the world that brave hearts still 
exist to fight injustice,'' end quote.
    When President Reagan spoke those words he was speaking of 
Hungary and Hungarians, who, like their Ukrainian neighbors 
today, inspired people everywhere with their bravery, their 
thirst for freedom, their zeal for democracy.
    In October 1956, Hungarian men and women took to the 
streets to stand up to Soviet oppression and demanded the right 
to control their destinies. They did so knowing that they could 
be imprisoned, tortured, or killed.
    Their courage changed the course of Hungary and Europe, and 
inspired successive generations who chose to dedicate their 
lives to advancing dignity, freedom, and liberty, including me.
    Whether serving in government to advance our nation's 
interests in the Security Council or working outside of 
government to uphold human rights, I have always strived to 
dedicate myself to advancing the fundamental values that make 
our nation exceptional.
    If confirmed, I will bring that same passion for our 
interests and values to my work as Ambassador to Hungary. 
Hungary is a longtime friend, ally, and partner that makes 
significant contributions to common security objectives such as 
combating terrorism, transnational crime, and weapons 
proliferation.
    As a NATO ally, Hungary supports efforts to defend NATO's 
eastern flank at this critical moment and has been our partner 
in addressing challenges around the world, including in 
Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Balkans.
    Hungary is also home to hundreds of U.S. companies and the 
citizens of our nations take part in rich and growing cultural, 
educational, and scientific exchanges.
    As both a NATO ally and a member of the European Union, 
Hungary joined the world in condemning Putin's unprovoked and 
brutal war in Ukraine and, ultimately, supported European Union 
efforts to impose severe costs on Putin.
    However, Hungary's reticence in that process and the 
obvious influence of Russia and China in Hungary and on its 
government are causes for serious concern, not just for the 
United States' interests or Europe's but for the people of 
Hungary.
    If confirmed, combating the malign influence of Moscow and 
Beijing and preserving and, indeed, strengthening our 
collective response to Putin's war of choice will be a top 
priority.
    The threats to democracy in Hungary are real and they merit 
our determined attention. Human rights, media freedom, and the 
rule of law are not ``nice to haves'' in Hungary or anywhere 
else. They are fundamental foundations for sustaining democracy 
and liberty, and for meeting people's most basic needs.
    Today in Hungary we see deeply troubling trends in each of 
these areas. If confirmed, I will support efforts to advance 
and protect these fundamental rights and transatlantic values.
    The opportunity to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Hungary is 
an opportunity to bring our countries closer together and 
deepen ties between our economies and our people, and that is 
essential because the fates of our nations are already very 
much linked.
    A free, safe, and secure Europe of which Hungary is an 
integral part is fundamental to a free, safe, and secure United 
States. The Hungarian people overwhelmingly view themselves as 
we do, as an integral part of the transatlantic community, and 
that shared conviction is something we have a vital interest in 
preserving.
    No matter how difficult the issues we face, we will not 
lose sight of our common interest in restoring peace and 
security in Europe or of Hungary's role in that, and we will 
not equivocate in advancing the cause of liberty and human 
dignity.
    If confirmed, I will do my utmost to bring us closer to 
each other and closer to democracy's promise.
    Thank you for your time and consideration. I would be 
honored to answer your questions.

    Senator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Pressman, very much.
    Now we will recognize Mr. Pyatt for your opening statement.

  STATEMENT OF HON. GEOFFREY R. PYATT OF CALIFORNIA, A CAREER 
MEMBER OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF CAREER MINISTER, 
    NOMINATED TO BE AN ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE [ENERGY 
                           RESOURCES]

    Mr. Pyatt. Thank you very much, Chairman Markey, Ranking 
Member Portman, members of the committee, for the honor of 
appearing again before you as President Biden's nominee for 
Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources.
    This is a pivotal time for the ENR Bureau, with headlines 
highlighting the importance of energy issues to our economy, 
daily lives of Americans, and to our national security, and I 
am grateful for the confidence that President Biden and 
Secretary Blinken have placed in me with this nomination.
    I would also like to introduce my wife, Mary, who has been 
my indispensable partner through a 33-year Foreign Service 
career and is joining me today.
    I am grateful for the support that members of this 
committee and its staff have offered through my nine years as 
an American ambassador in Europe and, if confirmed, I am 
committed to continuing that collaboration.
    Energy issues have been a major focus through the past two 
decades of my career. As U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, I saw 
every day how Russia weaponized energy to undermine European 
sovereignty and facilitate corruption.
    Putin's brutal invasion has caused a global spike in energy 
prices and Americans are suffering at the pump as a result. Our 
government is working tirelessly to minimize this pain, 
including by leading historic coordinated releases from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve alongside our partners and allies, 
and if confirmed, I will continue ENR's efforts to bolster fuel 
supplies on the global market and thwart Russia's use of energy 
as a weapon of war.
    Energy diversification is crucial to this effort. Over six 
years in Athens I was proud to partner with the Greek 
government to help that country become a leading ally promoting 
diversity of energy sources and routes in Europe.
    Importantly, our embassy team also supported Greece to 
adopt one of the EU's most ambitious energy transition agendas, 
often partnering with American companies that are creating jobs 
here at home.
    This committee has shown welcome interest in China's 
efforts to dominate the supply chain for inputs like critical 
minerals essential to the deployment of clean energy 
technologies.
    If confirmed, I commit to collaborating with you and your 
colleagues to secure critical mineral supply chains. I would 
also seek to sustain momentum for the Department of State's 
recently announced Mineral Security Partnership to ensure U.S. 
access to minerals that go into clean tech like batteries. I 
would work with the ENR team to build robust responsible supply 
chains to support economic prosperity in the United States.
    Putin's brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has 
rewritten the global energy map, and the United States has 
worked with our allies and partners to address the severe 
impacts, especially on Europe's energy security.
    Among Putin's many miscalculations in launching this war 
was his failure to anticipate how his actions would make our 
alliances stronger and accelerate energy transition.
    Together, with the EU, member states, global allies and 
partners, and the private sector, we are redirecting energy 
supplies to Europe, increasing efficiency measures to reduce 
overall energy demand, and accelerating the deployment of 
renewable technologies.
    My aim, if confirmed, will be to work with our allies and 
partners diplomatically and programmatically to free them from 
dependence on malign actors like Russia, to ensure that the 
United States and our partners benefit from the economic 
opportunities of the clean energy revolution and expedite a 
low-carbon future that provides reliable and affordable energy 
to all segments of society.
    Earlier in my State Department career I was honored to 
serve at the U.S. mission to the International Atomic Energy 
Agency in Vienna, where we worked intensively to advance clean 
nuclear power.
    I was also part of the negotiating team for the U.S.-India 
Civil Nuclear Agreement, which played a critical role in 
unlocking the relationship between our two democracies.

    If confirmed, I will work closely with colleagues from the 
State Department's ISN Bureau and the Department of Energy to 
support American leadership in civil nuclear technology, 
including the new generation of small modular reactors that 
promise a reliable source of base load power while advancing 
urgent climate goals.
    As a career economic officer, I take seriously the 
imperative to defend American commercial and technology 
leadership.
    If confirmed, I will work with business leaders and 
entrepreneurs to promote investment in U.S.-led energy 
technologies across all sectors, especially those needed to 
realize a low-carbon future. I would look forward to working 
with ENR's energy transformation and programs offices to 
amplify this effort.
    Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, energy security is 
front page news right now. But as Senator Lugar recognized in 
calling attention to these issues some two decades ago, our 
success requires persistent and strategically focused diplomacy 
to bolster our international energy partnerships. If confirmed, 
I would be honored to contribute to that task.
    Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to 
answering your questions.

partners to address the severe impacts, especially on Europe's energy 
security. Among Putin's many miscalculations in launching this war was 
his failure to anticipate how his actions would make our alliances 
stronger and accelerate energy transition. Together with the EU, member 
states, global allies and partners, and the private sector, we are re-
directing energy supplies to Europe, increasing efficiency measures to 
reduce overall energy demand, and accelerating the deployment of 
renewable technologies.
    My aim, if confirmed, will be to work with our allies and partners 
diplomatically and programmatically to free them from dependence on 
malign actors like Russia, to ensure that the United States and our 
partners benefit from the economic opportunities of the clean energy 
revolution, and expedite a low-carbon future that provides reliable and 
affordable energy to all segments of society.
    Earlier in my State Department career, I was honored to serve at 
the U.S. Mission to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, 
where we worked intensively to advance clean nuclear power. I was also 
a part of the negotiating team for the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear 
Agreement, which played a critical role in unlocking the relationship 
between our two democracies. If confirmed, I will work closely with 
colleagues from the State Department's ISN bureau and the Department of 
Energy to support American leadership in civil nuclear technology, 
including the new generation of small modular reactors that promise a 
reliable source of baseload power while advancing our urgent climate 
goals.
    As a career economic officer, I take seriously the imperative to 
defend American commercial and technology leadership. If confirmed, I 
will work with business leaders and entrepreneurs to promote investment 
in U.S.-led energy technologies across all sectors--especially those 
needed to realize a low carbon future. I would look forward to working 
with ENR's energy transformation and programs offices to amplify this 
effort.
    Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, energy security is front 
page news right now, but as Senator Lugar recognized in calling 
attention to these issues some two decades ago, our success requires 
persistent and strategically focused diplomacy to bolster our 
international energy partnerships. If confirmed, I would be honored to 
contribute to that task.
    Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to answering 
your questions.


    Senator Markey. Thank you, Ambassador Pyatt, and I would 
also like to enter into the record this letter of support for 
Ambassador Pyatt's nomination from the American Jewish 
Committee and from the Hellenic American Leadership Council, 
without objection, be entered into the record.

    Senator Markey. And finally, Ambassador Wood, your opening 
statement, please?

 STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT A. WOOD OF NEW YORK, NOMINATED TO BE 
 ALTERNATE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR 
SPECIAL POLITICAL AFFAIRS IN THE UNITED NATIONS, WITH THE RANK 
  OF AMBASSADOR, AND TO BE AN ALTERNATE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
    UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE SESSIONS OF THE GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS, DURING HIS TENURE OF SERVICE AS 
 ALTERNATE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR 
        SPECIAL POLITICAL AFFAIRS IN THE UNITED NATIONS

    Mr. Wood. Chairman Markey, Ranking Member Portman, 
distinguished members of the committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to come before you today as you take up my 
nomination to serve as United States Alternate Representative 
for Special Political Affairs at the United Nations in New 
York.
    I am greatly honored by the confidence and trust President 
Biden and Secretary Blinken have placed in me through this 
nomination, and if confirmed by the Senate I will defend to the 
utmost of my ability the fundamental values and interests of 
the American people.
    I also wish to thank my lovely wife, Gita, and son, 
Jonathan, for their love and support throughout our 
extraordinary Foreign Service journey. Without them, I would 
simply not be where I am today.
    As you know from reviewing my body of work over 34 years of 
government service, I have a great deal of experience working 
on multilateral issues that spans leadership roles in our 
missions to the European Union, the U.N. in Vienna, and the 
Conference on Disarmament.
    Multilateral diplomacy can be extremely challenging and 
frustrating, yet it is so vitally important to the defense and 
promotion of American values and national security interests.
    During a previous assignment at the U.S. mission to the 
U.N. in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, I witnessed the great 
work the U.N. can do, for example, the passage of U.N. Security 
Council Resolution 1267, which mandated sanctions on the 
Taliban and al-Qaeda, and of U.N. Security Council Resolution 
1373, establishing the U.N. Security Council Counterterrorism 
Committee.
    The passage of these two critical measures exemplified what 
the founders of the U.N. had envisioned--a body whose members 
would take prompt and effective action against those forces 
that represent serious threats to international peace and 
security.
    What also stood out for me at that time was just how 
essential U.S. leadership was to the passage of those two 
resolutions. U.S. leadership is especially crucial today as the 
international community confronts Russia's unprovoked and 
brutal war of aggression against the people and territory of 
Ukraine.
    Because of Russia's war in Ukraine its international 
isolation is now profound. If confirmed, I will work with other 
nations at the U.N. to widen and deepen that isolation.
    Russia must understand that its military and political 
leadership will be held accountable for the death and 
destruction it has perpetrated upon Ukraine. Let there be no 
mistake about that.
    Mr. Chairman, there are, of course, other immense 
challenges around the globe that call out for urgent 
international action, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
climate crisis, the proliferation and use of weapons of mass 
destruction, growing anti-Semitism, and a rise in the number of 
autocratic regimes and the inherent threats they pose to 
freedom of expression.
    No single state can or should be expected to tackle any of 
these issues by itself. It is only through collective action 
that we can hope to successfully address major threats.
    In the Security Council and beyond, the relentless efforts 
of our adversaries to undermine the broader rules-based 
international order should be a call to action for all who 
believe in a transparent, open, and human rights-centric United 
Nations.
    If confirmed, I will work vigorously to push back on 
Russian and Chinese efforts to reshape and undermine 
international law, institutions, and standards.
    The U.N. needs reform. If confirmed, one of my priorities 
will be to pursue President Biden's reform agenda for the 
United Nations. I will work tirelessly to ensure that American 
taxpayers' money is being well spent at the U.N., that sexual 
exploitation and abuse are rooted out of U.N. peace operations, 
that the U.N. Secretary General is given the tools to better 
fight malign influence, that human rights remain at the core of 
the U.N.'s work, and that everything possible is done to put an 
end to anti-Israel bias throughout the entire U.N. system.
    If confirmed, I would be honored to join Ambassador Thomas-
Greenfield and her team at the U.S. mission in New York in 
pushing forward the President's robust agenda at the United 
Nations, which includes increasing the number of qualified 
Americans employed at the world body, something, Mr. Chairman, 
I know you and your colleagues on this distinguished committee 
want to see as well.
    Again, thank you for giving me the opportunity to come 
before you. I look forward to answering any questions you may 
have.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Wood follows:]


               Prepared Statement of Hon. Robert A. Wood

    Again, thank you for giving me the opportunity to come before you. 
I look forward to answering any questions you may have.


    Senator Markey. Thank you, Ambassador, very much and we 
thank each of the witnesses.
    Before we go to questions and answers from the members of 
the committee, I have a few questions that speak to the 
importance that this committee places on responsiveness of all 
officials in the executive branch and that we expect and will 
be seeking from you. I would ask each of you to provide just a 
yes or no answer.
    Do you agree to appear before this committee and make 
officials from your office available to the committee and 
designated staff when invited?
    I ask each of you to say yes.
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    Senator Markey. Thank you. Do you agree--do you commit to 
keep this committee fully and currently informed about the 
activities under your purview?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    Senator Markey. Do you commit to engaging in meaningful 
consultation while policies are being developed, not just 
providing notification after the fact?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    Senator Markey. Do you commit to promptly responding to 
requests for briefings and information requested by the 
committee and its designated staff?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    Senator Markey. We thank you for that. Now we will turn to 
a question and answer period from the members.
    Ms. Shortino, from your perspective, what role should the 
United States play in the conversations to ensure that the IMF 
and other international institutions guarantee that Ukraine 
gets the help that they need? Their economy is collapsing by 40 
percent. What would you consider to be the correct plan for us 
to implement in the months and years ahead?
    Ms. Shortino. Absolutely. Thank you for that very important 
question, Senator.
    I think there is quite a lot that the Fund can do in terms 
of helping stabilize Ukraine's economy and help rebuild it. I 
do want to just say at the outset, like others here, I strongly 
condemn Russia's illegal war against Ukraine. This is a clear 
violation of rules and principles.
    The IMF can really step forward. It already has stepped 
forward with $1.4 billion in emergency financing to help 
stabilize and provide urgent needs to the Ukraine foreign 
exchange reserves.
    The IMF can provide policy advice, going forward, in terms 
of what the Ukrainians can do to stabilize their economy and 
also help identify financing needs and gaps that need to be 
filled.
    And as Ukraine moves into the reconstruction phase, we 
hope, at some point, IMF--the IMF will be a key player in terms 
of laying out the foundation for what a stable macro economy 
looks like and helping lay that foundation for other 
institutions, bilateral and multilateral, to step in.
    If confirmed, I would be working very hard to make sure 
that the IMF is very forward leaning in terms of its engagement 
with Ukraine.
    I would be working with other shareholders at the IMF and 
with management and staff to advance all of these issues.
    Senator Markey. Thank you.
    Ambassador Pressman, according to Freedom House, Hungary 
stands out in Europe for its unparalleled democratic erosion 
over the last decade, undergoing the largest decline over--ever 
measured in Freedom House's Report on Democracy in Europe or 
Eurasia.
    As ambassador, how would you engage with government 
officials, like-minded partners, and members of civil society 
to support independent media, advance the rights of the LGBTQI 
community, and support democratic institutions?
    Mr. Pressman. Chairman Markey, thank you for the question.
    You are absolutely correct with respect to the Freedom 
House ranking. In addition, I would say that, really, 
regardless of what political perspective you look at the 
indicators in Hungary, the American Enterprise Institute, the 
Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the World Bank, and 
Freedom House have all looked at indicators in terms of 
democratic processes and institutions and have seen decline in 
Hungary, and that should be a cause of enormous concern.
    Hungary is our partner and our ally. But what we are 
seeing--we use the term democratic backsliding and that is a 
little bit of a euphemism. I mean, I use the term as well, but 
it is--it belies the fact that--it suggests that as we are 
climbing up Mount Olympus, so to speak, we are slipping back 
unintentionally, and in fact, what we see in Hungary are 
affirmative choices by our partner that are having the 
predictable consequence of limiting media freedom, of 
undermining the independence of the judiciary, of targeting 
vulnerable populations.
    And so it is incumbent upon us, if I am confirmed, to 
engage unequivocally at the senior most political levels of the 
government to express our concerns but also to be engaging with 
civil society and the rich civil society that does exist in 
Hungary and that the space for which to operate has been 
limited to ensure that we are providing them with the most 
support we can to engage in the democratic process.
    Senator Markey. Thank you.
    And to you, Ambassador Pyatt, according to the Biden 
administration's review, the United States is 100 percent 
dependent on imports of 17 critical minerals and relies on 
China for refining and reprocessing.
    For instance, China processes 90 percent of the world's 
rare earth elements, 55 percent of the world's lithium, 65 
percent of the world's cobalt.
    What is your plan for the United States to be able to 
respond to this challenge that our country has now been posed 
with?
    Mr. Pyatt. Thank you, Chairman Markey.
    And let me start by saying that I think all of us as 
Americans should be concerned about the kind of monopoly that 
China has been able to achieve on these critical elements of 
the solar supply chain.
    Similarly, it is extremely important that the United States 
works with our partners and allies in order to ensure 
transparency and reliability of critical mineral supply chains 
around the world and to develop diversity of sources.
    In that regard, I am proud to say that the ENR Bureau has 
really been ahead of the curve in developing policy mechanisms 
and multilateral structures to work with like-minded countries 
on these issues through initiatives like the EITI--the 
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative--through the 
Mineral Security Partnership.
    These are the industries of the future and, Mr. Chairman, 
if you will allow me a short comment about Massachusetts. A 
great example is an American company that I was able to work 
with as ambassador in Greece called Advent Technologies.
    Advent is a path breaker on hydrogen fuel cell technology. 
It has an operation in Greece, and I was very proud to support 
Advent in their advocacy before the Greek government and they, 
just last week, received a positive signal.
    They will be getting about a billion dollars of EU funding 
to deploy hydrogen fuel cell technologies in Western Macedonia, 
a region of Greece formerly dominated by coal mining.
    It is a great example of the work our embassies can do but 
it is also a great example of how we need to build these 
international partnerships on these cutting-edge clean 
technologies. This is an area where we can prevail.
    Thank you very much.
    Senator Markey. Excellent. No, thank you, and thank you for 
singling out a Massachusetts company. Much appreciated.
    Secretary--Senator Portman?
    Senator Portman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will take that 
promotion.
    So I mentioned earlier that I have had the opportunity to 
work with you, Ambassador Pyatt, in your role in Ukraine. I 
thought you did a very good job there and, particularly, 
advocating a stronger position vis-a-vis Russia, and I am glad 
you are stepping up to do this.
    I am going to put you on the spot here, though, a little 
bit. You said, ``I have seen how Russia weaponized energy. We 
need to free Europeans of malign actors like Russia.''
    That is good. I just wonder if we are doing that, and I 
think about Nord Stream 2, what we did there. I mean, what this 
administration thought, as I understand it, is that if they 
approved Nord Stream 2, which the previous administration had 
disapproved, that somehow that would make Russia a better 
partner.
    What do you think about that? Do you think it made Russia a 
better partner?
    Mr. Pyatt. Senator, let me start by saying thank you to you 
and all the members of the committee for the tremendous support 
that I enjoyed as U.S. Ambassador in Ukraine. It made an 
extraordinary difference in the effectiveness of our diplomacy 
and our effort to support the choices of the Ukrainian people.
    On the question of energy, I will say a couple of quick 
things. First, Nord Stream 2 was a bad deal. I wish it did not 
take this brutal war to make the rest of the world understand 
that so clearly.
    Senator Portman. Let me just--I have only got a few minutes 
here, but not just the rest of world. What I am asking you, 
really, is what lessons did you learn from that and what did 
the United States learn from it? Because I think we made a 
mistake.
    I mean, some people say it gave Putin a green light. I do 
not go that far. I think he was seeing a green light everywhere 
he looked.
    But that was one of the reasons, I think, he decided, well, 
this is an indication that Europe and the United States are not 
going to stand up to me because I have weaponized energy 
effectively. They have even now approved Nord Stream 2 to make 
them more dependent on Russian oil.
    Is that the lesson you get from it?
    Mr. Pyatt. Senator, I would say Russia's manipulation 
continues today. You see it in the reduction of energy 
supplies----
    Senator Portman. Forty percent reduction on Nord Stream 1.
    Mr. Pyatt [continuing]. Even now.
    Senator Portman. And let me ask you that because I--again, 
I do not see you are going to answer my first question 
directly. But do you think we should do something about Nord 
Stream 1?
    Mr. Pyatt. I think we need to make sure that we do 
everything possible to ensure that people in Europe and 
everywhere else remember the way they felt on the 25th of 
February; that is, to make sure that we make sure that nobody 
ever again says that Russia can be a reliable energy supplier, 
that we do everything possible to reduce Russian revenues from 
oil and gas while also avoiding further disruption of a highly 
disrupted global energy marketplace.
    Senator Portman. Let me just suggest that we are doing the 
opposite in some regards, not with regard to Nord Stream 2 
anymore, although we did, thanks to the Germans finally 
deciding rightly so. That is not the issue.
    But last week, the Biden administration Treasury Department 
announced an extension of HC licenses through December 5th. 
This is allowing energy transactions to continue to be exempted 
from sanctions.
    It otherwise would have ended tomorrow, June 24th. We have 
extended that license. So these Russian banks are now able to 
transact energy deals and support the--again, the continued 
reliance on Russian energy.
    I pushed Treasury on this and was told the decision was 
made based on Europe's phased in of the energy embargo--the oil 
embargo, in particular--and, again, $870 million a day. That is 
what I am told is the average daily receipts that Russia is 
receiving with a nice margin and that is one reason you see the 
ruble gaining strength.
    That is why you see the Russian economy not being nearly as 
debilitated as the Ukrainian economy and, frankly, they are not 
feeling the pressure.
    What do you think about that? Should that license have been 
renewed that was set to expire tomorrow?
    Mr. Pyatt. Senator, I was not part of those policy 
deliberations. I do not have the benefit of all the 
perspectives so I cannot address that.
    What I will say is that it is very clear to me that we are 
in the early stages of this campaign and that if you look at 
what is happening in the Russian oil and gas industry--the 
gradual European phase out, the European decision on insurance 
for seaborne Russian oil, the disengagement of international 
companies from the Russian oil and gas industry, which is 
taking away technology and will inevitably damage Russia's 
ability to produce oil and gas--all of these things will raise 
the cost for Vladimir Putin of the outrageous events that have 
unfolded since the 24th of February.
    Senator Portman. As you know, I think we should be more 
aggressive and I hope you will be, and despite all the things 
you are saying they are doing just fine. And it is not just 
China and India that is providing all these resources to fund 
the war machine. It is our allies in Europe and elsewhere.
    I have lots more questions about Hungary and about the IMF. 
Hopefully, we will have a second round and, again, I am glad 
you are stepping up. I hope you will be as aggressive as I saw 
you in Ukraine where you actually helped push the 
Administration policy toward a more realistic view of Russia. I 
want to see the same thing with regard to your new role with 
regard to our energy crisis we face.
    Thank you.
    Mr. Pyatt. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Markey. Senator Kaine?
    Senator Kaine. Thank you to my colleagues, and 
congratulations to the nominees. What a qualified panel.
    I have questions for you, Ambassador Pyatt and Ms. 
Shortino.
    Ambassador Pyatt, not a question, just an observation. Your 
position is really important and I think it is really important 
the coordination that you will do with other parts of the 
Government, the Department of Energy and others.
    I am not an energy expert but I have been confused by the 
Administration's kind of messaging around energy policy. I give 
the Biden administration very high praise for the degree to 
which they have snapped together a set of democratic allies, 
not just NATO members but others as well, to deal with the 
illegal invasion of Ukraine.
    I think that a lot is going to be written about the 
prenegotiation of consequences if there should be an invasion--
we agree that this has to be done.
    The one piece, though, that I am confused about in the 
whole sort of comprehensive effort is the energy policy piece, 
and I get it that it is complicated because there are a number 
of goals we are trying to achieve at the same time.
    We want to transition the United States and the world to a 
lower and no-carbon energy future to save the planet. We are 
worried about pricing effects on Americans who are paying too 
much for gas at the pump.
    We want to help nations break free of reliance on petro 
dictators, both for the good of the planet but also because we 
do not want to have resources flowing to petro dictators that 
will embolden them.
    These are difficult goals to accomplish at the same time 
and, occasionally, there is timing that makes me confused. We 
had a hearing a couple of weeks ago. It was an energy-related 
hearing in this committee where sort of on the same day news 
was breaking that the President was going to be going to Saudi 
Arabia to try to get them to produce more energy.
    I have got major problems with any meeting with MBS because 
he is complicit in the murder of a Virginia journalist, Jamal 
Khashoggi, who was a Washington Post journalist whose family 
still lives in Virginia.
    But at the same time as the news was coming out about the 
potential for this meeting there was also an announcement out 
of a different part of the U.S. Government that oil leases that 
some oil companies had in Alaska were being canceled.
    Those leases, if they had not been canceled, they were not 
going to produce oil like this. But there was something odd 
about we are going to go to a dictator with blood on his hands 
and ask him to produce more energy and cancel leases at the 
same time.
    But, again, there is multiple goals that we are trying to 
accomplish and it is hard. But what I really have not yet seen 
from the Administration is sort of here is the near-term 
strategy that we are going to pursue to help backstop European 
allies and help wean them away from reliance on Russian energy.
    Here is what U.S. productive capacity can help them do in 
the short term. But here is the long-term strategy where we are 
going to help our allies move toward the lower and no-carbon 
energy future.
    That, obviously, is a tall order to have a strategy that 
has got this near-term and medium-term and long-term approach 
to it. But I think you are going to be in a unique position 
because of the work that you have already done and the 
credibility you have to in the kind of interagency dialogue, 
whether it is at the White House or DOE or State, to kind of 
balance these domestic policy imperatives with foreign policy 
imperatives.
    I think you are just perfectly suited for this role. But I 
am just putting that marker down to say I would like to see a 
lot more clarity from the Administration about how we are going 
to try to accomplish these goals. We cannot accomplish them all 
at once but we can have a phased effort to do so.
    Ms. Shortino, I want to talk to you. I am very--I am 
focused on the Americas a lot. I am the chairman of the 
Subcommittee over the Americas, and a nation that we have some 
opportunities with but I am really worried about now is 
Argentina.
    The IMF--I think the largest loan that the IMF ever did was 
a 2018 loan to Argentina that, frankly, was to stabilize their 
economy and it did not really work, and the IMF has studied, 
okay, why did we do it that way and why did it not work.
    Argentina is, in some instances now, getting closer to 
China, invited to be part of the BRICS meetings. They are the 
latest addition to the Belt and Road Initiative with China. 
They are, I think, participating in the Shanghai--the alternate 
development bank that China is setting up as kind of a 
competitor to the IMF.
    I would like you--now I have really filibustered. I have 
asked my question and I only have a few seconds left. Talk a 
little bit about what we might do with Argentina through the 
IMF to, hopefully, improve the relationships we have with them.
    And I apologize, Mr. Chair, for taking five minutes to ask 
a question. But if you will let her answer I would really 
appreciate it.
    Senator Markey. Absolutely.
    Please, Ambassador.
    Ms. Shortino. Absolutely.
    And, Senator Kaine, I could not share your concerns any 
more. I mean, Argentina--it is a complicated case. This is a 
country that has seen economic issues for decades now. There 
are no easy answers, to be sure.
    Can the IMF come in and bring this economy back to a place 
where it can be stable and it can eventually grow and reaccess 
markets? I, certainly, hope so. It is not going to be an easy 
task.
    That said, this new IMF program that is in place it does 
have the ability, if executed, to lay the foundation by 
bringing inflation down, bringing down the fiscal deficit, 
restoring confidence in markets, that will actually move 
Argentina on the right path.
    Is that path going to be quick? Absolutely not. But can we 
start nudging them in that direction? Yes, I think we can.
    If confirmed, I would, really, be working to see is 
Argentina--are we holding Argentina's feet to the fire? Are 
they executing on what they committed to do with the IMF? And 
if they are not we need to have the courage to stand up and say 
we do not support this.
    If they are, I think we can work with other key members at 
the IMF to really push them in the right direction. It is going 
to take a lot of work but I think the IMF is uniquely placed in 
its role to actually get them headed in that direction.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you so much. I appreciate my 
colleagues' patience.
    Senator Markey. And I thank the Senator.
    I know Senator Johnson had signed on to ask questions 
remotely.
    Are you there, Senator Johnson?
    [No response.]
    Senator Markey. If not, the Senator from New Hampshire, 
Senator Shaheen?
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And congratulations to each of you on your nominations and 
thank you for your willingness to continue to serve the 
country.
    Ambassador Pyatt, I would like to begin with you because so 
much of our focus has been on how do we produce more energy--
how do we replace what Russia is doing.
    But there has not been much on the demand side on energy, 
and at some point before the Russian invasion a couple of years 
ago I remember seeing a report that showed that Ukraine was the 
most energy inefficient country in Europe.
    I wonder if you could talk about how we can get some of 
these countries focused on using less energy. Most of that 
technology is off the shelf that can be put in very quickly.
    But I think there are a lot of both residential consumers 
and businesses that do not understand what a difference it 
would make if they swap out all their light bulbs and light 
fixtures and do other measures that would ensure that they are 
more efficient.
    Mr. Pyatt. Thank you, Senator, and you are exactly right, 
and Mary will tell you that when we were living in Kyiv, 
because you had centralized heating every October the 
centralized heating system would turn on and then we would open 
all the windows because that is how you kept the temperature 
manageable before it got really cold outside.
    Senator Shaheen. It is kind of like the Capitol here, that 
it is--the warmer it gets outside the colder it gets in here.
    Mr. Pyatt. And, Senator, the challenge is that in so much 
of Europe a major demand driver for natural gas is, in fact, 
home heating. And so while Europe is not having the debate we 
are having here in the United States over $6 a gallon gasoline, 
what it is having is an enormous debate over home utility 
bills, which are going through the roof as gas prices have 
quadrupled, gone up over seven times since the start of the 
COVID pandemic.
    Making these changes is critically important. Rewiring 
European energy infrastructure to electrify home heating, to 
introduce efficiency measures like smart thermostats, this is 
all going to take time, especially in developing countries, in 
the western Balkans, in places like Ukraine. There is an 
important role to be played by USAID, by the Department of 
Energy, by ENR.
    And I will say, Senator, during my time in Kyiv I was 
really grateful for the interagency partnership that we had, 
largely, led by ENR, by the way, but bringing together all 
these instruments of the U.S. Government to help the Ukrainians 
reduce their dependence on Russia.
    It was a major accomplishment that almost simultaneous with 
the invasion Ukraine switched its electricity grids over to the 
European grid.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank goodness.
    Mr. Pyatt. That was the fruit of resources that this 
committee helped to provide but work that started way back in 
2014 in terms of modernizing the infrastructure.
    You are exactly right and, certainly, if confirmed, this 
will be part of the agenda that I will bring to the office.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you. I appreciate that. I know it is 
longer term but I think it is very important to have that on 
the agenda.
    Ms. Shortino, it is clear that part of what is happening in 
Ukraine with Russia is their effort to control the Black Sea to 
keep Ukraine from getting its grain out and the impact that 
that is having not just on Ukraine but on the rest of the 
world.
    Can you talk about whether IMF has a role in trying to help 
put pressure on Russia?
    Ms. Shortino. Absolutely, and I think you raise a very 
valid concern.
    I mean, the IMF has quite a few roles to play in this whole 
broader crisis. The first is to assess and provide countries 
with policy advice around these spillover impacts. It will be 
bringing forward a program soon for Egypt. This is one of the 
countries that is significantly impacted by higher food prices.
    It is also engaging in other countries as well. It is 
looking, more broadly, at the food crisis impact for all of 
these countries. Its surveillance and its lending, its capacity 
development, are very key in terms of supporting the policy 
response.
    With regards to Russia, I think in this instance, really, 
if confirmed, my role would be to sort of minimize Russia's 
impact, Russia's voice at the Fund.
    The Fund--they have a responsibility to do surveillance on 
the Russian economy. The Russians should allow them to do that 
because then we can see just how badly the economy is doing. 
Right now, Russia is not publishing a lot of that data.
    If confirmed, I would really push for the IMF to be doing 
that sort of analysis so that we can have an accurate picture 
of this--what the effect has been on the Russian economy.
    Senator Shaheen. I, certainly, hope that you and our other 
international institutions will voice the concern about what 
Russia is doing with respect to food stocks and the impact that 
that is having around the world, and take the position that 
that is not acceptable and that we need to stand up to Putin on 
that.
    And my view is we should work through the U.N. and escort 
ships into the Black Sea and get that grain out because we 
should not let Vladimir Putin starve millions of people in 
Africa and Latin America.
    I know that my time is up but I would just like to add, 
Ambassador Wood, the news reports yesterday and today have been 
about the devastating earthquake in Afghanistan and, obviously, 
given the role of the Taliban it is--the kind of international 
aid that might be coming is more difficult under the current 
circumstances.
    I hope you, at the U.N., will lobby the U.N. agencies that 
have continued to work in Afghanistan to ensure that we are 
doing everything possible to respond and also to address what 
is happening with women and girls in the country.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Markey. Senator Cardin?
    Senator Cardin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Markey. Excuse me. I have been told that Senator 
Booker has been waiting in line--I apologize to you--on video.
    If you do not mind, Senator Cardin.
    Senator Cardin. Not a problem.
    Senator Markey. Senator Booker, if you are there you are 
recognized.
    Senator Booker. I am here. I just want to mark for history 
that this may be the only time in my life that I get to cut 
ahead of a man with such seniority and stature as Senator 
Cardin. Thank you for your graciousness.
    Senator Cardin. As long as Senator Booker does not use 
physical force to get in between me, as he did with Senator 
Tester.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. I appreciate that.
    I am really excited that this is, really, in my opinion, a 
very important Pride Month here in the United States of America 
with a lot of the challenges we are seeing that the LGBTQ 
community persists to face.
    But I want to talk, Mr. Pressman, if I can, about LGBTQ 
issues on an international stage but more specifically in 
Hungary.
    Since Viktor Orban's rise to power over a decade ago, the 
Hungarian Government has rolled back a lot of democratic norms, 
as the chairman mentioned in his comments earlier.
    It has diminished the independence of governing 
institutions meant to provide the necessary checks and 
balances, limiting space for civil society and has been openly 
hostile towards vulnerable populations and, specifically, the 
LGBTQ+ population.
    Orban's government has rescinded legal recognition of 
transgender people and passed a law banning the use of 
materials seen as, ``promoting homosexuality and gender 
fluidity at schools.''
    If confirmed, how will you press the Hungarian Government 
to respect the rights of all of her citizens, especially 
vulnerable, discriminated against groups like the LGBTQ+ 
population?
    And then I just want to add to that, how can the U.S. work 
with the EU to ensure that the Hungarian Government is held 
accountable for any violations of human rights in its crackdown 
on civil society in general and LGBTQ groups specifically?
    Mr. Pressman. Thank you, Senator, for that question.
    And I cannot emphasize enough how important the issues you 
raise are and they would be the crackdown on civil society, 
generally, but the use of anti-LGBT rhetoric and policies in a 
way that is about, fundamentally, trying to exclude a 
population from the democratic process.
    And so whether the rhetoric is anti-LGBT, antisemitic, 
anti-Roma, to the extent that it has the impact of trying to 
remove a population from its ability to engage in democracy it 
is a corrosive. It is dangerous and merits a unequivocal and 
immediate response from people across society, including at the 
senior most levels of government.
    And so, Senator, if confirmed, you have my commitment that 
I would engage directly at all levels with the Hungarian 
government--thank you--at all levels with the Hungarian 
Government but, in addition, would work very much with civil 
society, who is operating in a limited space, to try to make 
progress on this important set of issues.
    Senator Booker. And while I have you--and by the way, that 
assurance gives me great confidence in my support for you on 
the floor in the United States Senate as well as in committee.
    But you know the challenges we are facing, obviously, in 
Ukraine. I was in Poland and just recently in Germany, but 
Hungary has taken 700,000 Ukrainian refugees, which is a good 
thing.
    But I am worried about Hungary's increasing nationalism and 
the backsliding and, frankly, their cozy relationship with 
Russia and their dependence on Russia for natural gas and oil.
    I am skeptical, really, of Hungary's continued actions 
regarding the war in Ukraine and so, just really quickly, 
because I still want to get one more question in, if confirmed, 
how will you work with the Orban government regarding Hungary's 
approach and response to the war in Ukraine?
    And if you can do that in 20 seconds I would appreciate it.
    Mr. Pressman. I will try my best, Senator.
    Let me just say I share your concern. I think that in terms 
of engaging on this issue we have to tackle the problem of 
Russian influence on the government of Hungary and to do that 
it requires being direct with our concerns.
    It requires investing in civil society's capacity to render 
more transparent what those relationships are, including 
independent media, and it requires supporting the European 
Union in tackling some of the corruption challenges as well.
    Senator Booker. That was an impressive 20 seconds, sir. You 
have a----
    Mr. Pressman. I tried.
    Senator Booker [continuing]. You have a talent and a gift 
in diplomacy that many Senators do not share.
    Really quick, Ms. Shortino, can you just talk to me? One of 
my biggest concerns in the Senate right now is the global food 
crisis and we have been working very hard, my office along with 
others on this committee, to try to get that addressed.
    And so what role can the IMF play in helping countries hit 
by high food prices and what kind of financial assistance can 
the IMF provide to the worst affected nations? If you could 
just give me that answer.
    And, Mr. Chairman, thank you for your indulgence.
    Ms. Shortino. Absolutely, and that is a huge concern right 
now. I mean, this is a crisis that is really facing a lot of 
countries and low income countries in particular, who already 
have very high debt levels and very limited fiscal space.
    It is really incumbent upon the IMF to come in and provide 
support. Briefly, they can provide policy advice to these 
countries in terms of how to address their fiscal structure, 
how to strengthen their external position so that they are able 
to import higher priced goods.
    They can also provide lending, and as I had mentioned 
earlier, there is going to be a large program coming up for 
Egypt. There are several other lending programs in the works 
that will address--in a good way will provide near-term 
financing but will also include conditions that address some of 
the underlying vulnerabilities that have gotten these countries 
into this position in the context of the higher food prices.
    And, of course, capacity development. The IMF has very 
strong capacity development, particularly in the area of fiscal 
and monetary policy, and can help build up these countries' 
ability to manage higher debt, to manage, fiscal transparency.
    All of these things, in the end, will help make these 
economies more stable and able to respond to crises such as 
these.
    Senator Booker. Thank you. I look forward to working with 
you on this issue. I look forward to supporting you on the 
floor and in committee.
    And, Senator Cardin and Chairman, thank you for the 
indulgence of the extra one minute and 45 seconds.
    Senator Markey. Thank you, Senator Booker.
    Senator Cardin?
    Senator Cardin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    What I think I will do--we have a business meeting of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee that will take place at 
11:00. I know we have a limited amount of time.
    I am going to ask most of my questions for the record in 
respect for the time that we have available. I just want to 
thank all of our nominees for their willingness to serve.
    Mr. Pressman, I enjoyed our conversation, and just to 
further enlighten our members, I think your background in 
regards to war crimes is something that could be extremely 
helpful to us as we look at the challenges that we have in 
regards to holding Russia accountable for its activities in 
Ukraine.
    I do want to just underscore also the point of your 
background as co-chair of the International Bar Association's 
Human Rights Law Committee. It will serve you well as our 
representative in Hungary.
    I just really want to underscore the importance for the 
U.S. Embassy to be a refuge for the human rights defenders 
within Hungary.
    Hungary presents challenges for us as a NATO ally and as a 
member of the European Union. The Orban government has not only 
violated the commitments of the Helsinki Final Act--I chair the 
U.S. Helsinki Commission--but also represents a challenge for 
Europe in violating its commitments in regards to the rights in 
the law that they pass affecting the LGBTQ community.
    You are going to have your hands full in Hungary. But I 
think you are the right person to do that and I thank you for 
your willingness to serve.
    Mr. Chairman, I will ask my questions for the record.
    Thank you.
    Senator Markey. Thank you, Senator.
    And we thank all of our witnesses for your answering of our 
questions today. We are looking forward to seeing all of the 
good work which you are going to be doing in your new post.
    Members of the committee will have until the close of 
business tomorrow, Friday, June 24th, to revise and extend 
their remarks and submit questions for the record with a prompt 
response from witnesses to those questions.
    We thank everyone for their participation today.
    With that, this hearing is adjourned.


    [Whereupon, at 10:28 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

                              ----------

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
       Submitted to Elizabeth Shortino by Senator Robert Menendez

Fiscal Consolidation Measures
    Question. The compounding crises of the COVID-19 pandemic and war 
in Ukraine have exacerbated significant challenges faced by many 
countries that were already facing rising debt distress prior to the 
pandemic, as well as a widening financing gap to achieve their 
development goals. The IMF provided critical emergency support for many 
countries during the pandemic, which came with few strings attached. 
However, it has recently returned to including fiscal consolidation 
measures as conditions to its programs, such as cuts to social spending 
and regressive tax measures, that can exacerbate both economic and 
gender inequality. These measures threaten to undermine efforts to 
achieve an equitable and sustainable recovery. A report released in 
2021 by the Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) of the IMF has called 
on the institution to strengthen its monitoring and reporting of the 
social and distributional impacts of its programs and policies to 
protect vulnerable groups.

   Would you support a policy at the IMF that would require measures 
        such as the systematic use of robust poverty and distributional 
        impact assessments, that evaluate the possible and actual 
        effects of programs on wages, health and social protection 
        programs, vulnerable populations, and inequality?

    Answer. Since the onset of the COVID crisis, the IMF has provided 
over $200 billion in financing to countries in need, more than $33 
billion of this total as fast-disbursing emergency financing. More 
recently, as countries have begun to transition toward establishing 
longer-term recovery plans, the IMF has supported this shift through 
traditional financing programs grounded in an agreed framework of 
critical macroeconomic and structural reforms. These frameworks are 
essential to help cement sustainable recoveries and build the 
confidence of citizens and external lenders in the credibility of the 
borrower's policy framework. Policy conditionality is also essential to 
ensure that IMF resources are appropriately safeguarded.
    In this context, IMF staff have increasingly incorporated 
assessments of the poverty and distributional impacts of any proposed 
policy changes, and have worked to design conditionality such that it 
supports the most vulnerable while addressing macroeconomic imbalances. 
For instance, many IMF programs include minimum targets that countries 
must maintain on social safety net spending, or couple reforms to ill-
targeted or regressive price controls with enhancement of programs that 
provide support to the poorest households. If confirmed, I will 
continue to press the need to incorporate this type of analysis into 
the IMF's policy engagement with countries, especially those in IMF 
financing programs, and to work to ensure that policy conditionality 
takes into account the impacts on the most vulnerable.

Special Drawing Rights
    Question. As the largest shareholder at the IMF, the U.S. is in a 
unique position to advance or block progress on key issues, as we saw 
with the Special Drawing Rights issuance that was finally approved more 
than a year into the pandemic because the former Administration held up 
the release of these critical resources. Many countries have now used 
the majority or even all of the SDRs they received in the recent 
issuance, in large part because the distribution of SDRs was incredibly 
uneven. The vast majority went to countries like the U.S. that don't 
need them because the issuance has not been based on need but on quota.

   What is your position on the U.S. reallocating some of its SDRs and 
        would you support alternative channeling vehicles outside of 
        the IMF?

    Answer. Domestic legal requirements limit the ability of the United 
States to ``reallocate'' SDRs. Treasury is seeking, and requires, 
Congressional authorization to lend up to $21 billion to the IMF for 
the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust and the Resilience and 
Sustainability Trust. The G20 is exploring viable alternative vehicles 
for channeling SDRs at the multilateral development banks, but many 
central banks face constraints on the use of their reserves, which 
include SDRs, outside of the IMF.

    Question. Secondly, do you think that the problem of uneven 
distribution of SDRs and that they have now been used in 2 recent 
crisis contexts (including in 2009 during the Global Financial Crisis) 
means that the IMF should reform the rules around SDR issuances?

    Answer. The IMF issues SDRs to meet the long-term global demand for 
reserves. Under a general allocation of new SDRs, the IMF allocates 
SDRs in proportion to members' quota shares, which are broadly linked 
to their share of the global economy. Changing the rules regarding SDR 
issuance would require an amendment to the IMF's Articles of Agreement.
    While an SDR allocation does result in advanced economies receiving 
SDRs, the most recent allocation was part of a broader strategy to help 
hard-hit countries respond to the economic impacts of the COVID crisis 
and has allowed some major economies to lend their new SDRs in support 
of low-income countries through the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth 
Trust and the Resilience and Sustainability Trust. Low-income countries 
received about $21 billion in SDRs through the allocation, which 
represents approximately 2.8 percent of their GDP.

Quota Reform Agenda
    Question. Next year the IMF will be undergoing its 16th General 
Review of Quotas. The Board has requested that this Quota Reform 
revisit the adequacy of quotas, and continue the process of IMF 
governance reform-including a proposed new quota formula as a guide. 
Any adjustment in quota shares would likely result in an increase in 
the share of emerging market and developing countries as a whole, while 
protecting the voice and representation of the poorest members.
    Under the Resolution, the 16th Review should be completed no later 
than December 15, 2023.

   What will you prioritize in this reform agenda?

    Answer. Treasury has not yet begun detailed discussions around the 
16th General Review of Quotas. If confirmed, I look forward to engaging 
as appropriate with Congress to help ensure this review advances key 
U.S. interests at the IMF.

    Question. Do you think the U.S. should maintain its veto power or 
is it time to move on, and if so, why or why not?

    Answer. U.S. leadership at the international financial institutions 
remains indispensable, including at the IMF. The United States remains 
the world's largest economy accounting for nearly 25 percent of global 
GDP. The United States should maintain its veto power over major policy 
decisions at the IMF. If confirmed, I will strongly oppose any change 
in IMF governance that would remove or threaten the U.S. veto.

    Question. How would you balance the clear need for more democratic 
decision making at the IMF with the leadership role of the U.S.?

    Answer. The IMF has strong governance structures underpinned by 
U.S. leadership, and governance systems that reflects the need for 
members to take on appropriate roles and responsibilities in the global 
economy. The IMF should remain a quota-based institution with votes 
linked to quota shares, and the United States should retain its 
leadership role, including its veto over major policy decisions.
    At the same time, most decisions taken by the Executive Board are 
based on majority decisions and reflect the broad views of the IMF's 
membership. Countries whose economic weight has expanded rapidly have a 
growing expectation that their influence over these decisions should 
increase as well. For this to happen, I believe it is important that 
these countries demonstrate their willingness and ability to act in 
ways that support and strengthen the global institutional framework 
that the IMF and other organizations comprise. If confirmed, I will 
press for beneficiaries of governance reform to act as responsible 
stewards of the IMF and the global economy.


    Question. As part of governance reform, a strong case could be made 
that it is important to have more space for civil society to inform IMF 
programs in their countries and to have opportunities to hold the IMF 
more accountable when harm occurs. The MDBs have such policies but the 
IMF does not.

   Would you support a policy to mandate CSO consultation in IMF 
        operations and a system of accountability?

    Answer. I support IMF country teams engaging robustly with groups 
that represent key economic stakeholders in respective countries, which 
is important to enhance IMF staff's understanding of the political and 
economic realities in each country and to underpin the credibility of 
IMF policy engagement. Discussions with CSOs already form a regular 
component of many country teams' economic surveillance and program 
development processes. Additionally, the IMF Executive Board generally 
meets with CSOs from around the world to discuss broad global issues 
and IMF policies twice a year

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
       Submitted to Elizabeth Shortino by Senator James E. Risch

Manangement
    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout your post?

    Answer. Morale is generally high within the Office of the U.S. 
Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the post 
is staffed with experienced Treasury personnel who are rotating into 
these positions through a competitive process. That said, due to the 
COVID-19 crisis, the workload at the office has never been higher, and 
opportunities for in-person interaction remain limited by COVID 
policies and restrictions, both of which have created new stress for 
staff.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at your post?

    Answer. If confirmed, I intend to work closely with staff within 
Office of the U.S. Executive Director to ensure the office is meeting 
their personal and professional needs. This includes providing flexible 
work schedules where feasible; regularly adjusting workload across the 
office; providing opportunities for training, staff development, and 
leadership; and regularly seeking out and incorporating feedback from 
staff on the operations of the office. I also intend to work closely 
with the Senior Advisor to the U.S. Executive Director, a seasoned 
Treasury civil servant, to provide day-to-day guidance and support to 
staff.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at your post?

    Answer. The mission of the U.S. Executive Director and its office 
is to advance U.S. priorities and interests at the International 
Monetary Fund. If confirmed, I will work closely with the Treasury 
Department and staff within the U.S. Executive Director's office to 
confirm we have a shared understanding of this mission and develop a 
vision for how the office can effectively execute this mission. This 
includes identifying key policy priorities and issue areas, developing 
strategies for engagement, and monitoring progress. I would hold 
regular, quarterly sessions with Treasury and office staff to discuss 
these topics, in addition to ad hoc engagement on specific issues as 
they arise. I would also hold regular strategy sessions with staff in 
the office to discuss how the office can operate most effectively in 
executing this mission.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for senior officials. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I would describe myself as a manager who likes to empower 
and develop staff. I delegate many tasks to staff and provide 
oversight, guidance, and direction. I support staff efforts to seek out 
training or take on new challenges. I also hire people with a diverse 
set of skills and backgrounds so that the office has a range of views 
and perspectives. I believe a more diverse team is critical to 
enhancing the effectiveness of the office. Finally, I try accommodating 
staff personal and professional needs in my management approach, 
allowing for flexibility wherever feasible.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. Absolutely not, and I have never done so. It is important 
for a manager to create an environment of trust, including by 
supporting staff and developing strong working relationships.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your deputy?

    Answer. If confirmed, I envision relying upon my deputy for day-to-
day management responsibilities of the office so that I can take a more 
strategic approach to executing the mission of the office. I also plan 
to seek regular advice from my deputy on a range of issues and to 
delegate topics that do not require my direct engagement. I plan to 
discuss the division of labor with my deputy to ensure we are both in 
agreement on how to run the office most effectively.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your deputy?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would entrust the day-to-day management of 
staff and workload within the Office of the U.S. Executive Director to 
my deputy. I would also rely upon my deputy to form relationships with 
other offices within the IMF, as well as to represent the United States 
in certain Executive Board meetings of the IMF.

Human Rights, Democracy, and International Organizations
    Question. If confirmed, how will you work with interlocutors and 
policy-makers at the IMF to encourage the inclusion of a counter-
trafficking strategy, including risk assessment and mitigation efforts 
as need, in proposed IMF projects in countries listed on Tier 2 Watch 
List and Tier 3 of the State Department's most recent Trafficking in 
Persons report?

    Answer. I share your deep concern over the terrible human toll of 
Trafficking in Persons (TIP), and if confirmed I will work to 
incorporate consideration of TIP into the IMF's activities at every 
opportunity, consistent with the scope of the IMF's mandate. I will 
continue to implement our mandate from Congress to vote against funding 
for any countries listed on Tier 3 of the TIP Report, absent relevant 
waivers or legislative exceptions. More broadly, improving economic 
governance and reducing channels for corruption is a key tool for 
fighting human trafficking, and to that end I will work with other 
Board members and with IMF staff and management to incorporate 
consideration of TIP issues into the IMF's framework for addressing 
governance and corruption, which is set for Executive Board review 
later this year.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
          to Elizabeth Shortino by Senator Benjamin L. Cardin

Ukraine and Russia
    Question. If confirmed, what direction would you provide for the 
IMF related to support for Ukraine and restrictions on Russia?

    Answer. Russia's unprovoked war against Ukraine is horrific and 
unjustifiable. I am committed to continuing to work with Treasury, IMF 
management, and U.S. partners at the IMF to prevent Russia from 
obtaining financing, loans, or other benefits from its membership at 
the IMF. Likewise, if confirmed, I will press for the IMF to use every 
available tool to support Ukraine as it contends with the economic 
fallout of Russia's brutal invasion. This includes engagement by the 
IMF country team to help Ukraine's authorities understand and evaluate 
policy options, and financial support consistent with IMF policies.

China
    Question. In your view, how should the United States seek to 
influence the IMF's engagement with China as China's role in the global 
economy continues to widen?

    Answer. It is essential that the IMF engages with China across a 
broad scope of issues as its global role widens. On debt issues, China 
is the world's largest bilateral official creditor, and the IMF must be 
willing to press PRC authorities, including publicly if necessary, to 
take appropriate actions to deal with growing debt risks, including by 
fulfilling China's commitments under the Common Framework. In country 
surveillance, the IMF must credibly address the policies that sustain 
China's chronic external imbalances and identify and assess the risks 
to its economic and financial sustainability, as the potential for 
spillovers from these channels to the global economy increases. If 
confirmed, I will work closely with IMF management and like-minded 
Board members to press for these steps.

    Question. How do U.S. actions at the IMF and other international 
institutions affect China's interest in establishing Chinese-led 
institutions, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)?

    Answer. The United States plays an indispensable role in helping to 
ensure that international institutions in which we participate uphold 
the highest standards of integrity and credibility and work to achieve 
the broad goals of the international community. In some cases, our 
insistence on high levels of transparency and accountability, and the 
implementation of policy reforms as a condition for financing, has led 
some countries to seek alternative lending options that do not uphold 
these high standards. Although I cannot speak for China's motives in 
establishing the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, I believe it is 
in the interest of the United States to support the international 
institutions that we helped to establish, and we should work to 
maintain their effectiveness and ability to respond to members' needs. 
As part of this effort, the United States should work with emerging 
market economies to ensure their responsible engagement in these 
important institutions.

         Submitted to Elizabeth Shortino by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. Last year, the IMF agreed to distribute more than $650 
billion worth of ``special drawing rights'' or ``SDRs'' to all of its 
member states. Countries can exchange SDRs for cash in the event they 
need money, or to supplement their foreign currency reserves. Through 
the distribution, the People's Republic of China received more than $30 
billion in free cash from the IMF. More than that, since 2016, 
countries can exchange SDRs for the PRC's currency, the yuan. Countries 
indebted to the CCP can exchange these SDRs for yuan to pay off their 
Belt and Road Initiative debts, which funnels even more money to a 
genocidal regime.

   Which countries have exchanged their SDRs for yuan since 2021?

    Answer. As of end-May 2022, China's SDR holdings have increased by 
about $2.3 billion, meaning China has purchased additional SDRs, though 
it may not have provided RMB in all of these exchanges. The IMF does 
not publish information on specific transaction parties or the 
currencies for which SDRs are exchanged.

    Question. How does the IMF monitor the use of funds provided by 
SDRs to the CCP?

    Answer. China's SDRs are held by its central bank as reserve 
assets. Broadly, China has no need to ``use'' its SDRs--i.e., exchange 
its SDRs for hard currency or use them to service IMF obligations--as 
its central bank already holds very ample foreign exchange reserves. 
Since the 2021 SDR allocation, China has purchased additional SDRs, 
which continue to be held by its central bank. Additionally, in 2021, 
China agreed to loan 1 billion SDRs to the IMF's Poverty Reduction and 
Growth Trust, and has pledged to lend additional SDRs to the IMF's 
newly approved Resilience and Sustainability Trust. If confirmed, I 
will continue to push for the IMF to enhance transparency around 
members' use of SDRs.

    Question. How much of it is being utilized, or in contribution, to 
commit genocide, steal American technology, or fund the modernization 
of China's military?

    Answer. SDRs are not currency; rather they are a reserve asset that 
can only be exchanged by a holder for useable currency in transactions 
recorded by the IMF's SDR Department. Accordingly, China holds its SDRs 
as a reserve asset at its central bank. China's central bank has not 
used its SDRs, but rather has purchased additional SDRs (i.e., provided 
hard currency to other IMF members in exchange for SDRs).

    Question. If confirmed, will you commit to opposing future SDR 
allocations until the CCP agrees to an audit of its use of SDR funds, 
or the IMF implements restrictions on the CCP's use of those funds?

    Answer. China has not used its SDRs; it holds more SDRs than its 
allocation and has not gained additional usable currency as a result of 
any SDR exchanges.

    Question. The IMF plays a critical role in the global economy by 
providing sovereign lending to countries experiencing fiscal problems 
and improving these countries' financial practices. Most prominently, 
it has provided sorely needed loans to Ukraine, which is defending 
itself against Putin's unprovoked and unjustified invasion. The IMF can 
and should play a role in helping countries resist the less dramatic, 
but no less dangerous, influence of the Chinese Communist Party, which 
has ensnared countries like Sri Lanka, Uganda, and Ecuador in hundreds 
of millions of dollars' worth of predatory loans. In return for debt 
relief, the CCP extracts enormous concessions out of these countries 
that reduces their independence and expands the military presence of 
the People's Liberation Army. In Cambodia, the Hun Sen regime's 
external debt is estimated to be $9 billion, with China accounting for 
40 percent. As was reported a few weeks ago, the PLA Navy opened a 
naval base in Ream, and some believe the PLA Air Force is setting up a 
facility at Dara Sakor. These installations would significantly improve 
the PLA's power projection abilities in the region.

   Should the IMF support countries suffering from the Chinese 
        Communist Party's predatory lending practices?

    Answer. Yes. The IMF must continue to engage robustly with 
countries for whom debt vulnerabilities--including from unfair and 
opaque PRC official lending--is an increasing problem. The IMF can 
provide technical assistance and policy engagement to help countries 
better understand the scope of their debt issues and to identify policy 
options for addressing them. It can also provide critical visibility 
into the impact of PRC debt on its members' macroeconomic 
vulnerabilities, to enable more effective bilateral and multilateral 
engagement by other countries. Finally, where appropriate, IMF lending 
can help support countries' economic reform efforts when they are 
underpinned by a credible macroeconomic framework, which may include 
debt restructuring or forgiveness where debt has become unsustainable. 
If confirmed, I commit to working to ensure that the IMF's engagement 
in these areas strengthens the ability of borrowing countries to resist 
and respond to the negative effects of predatory lending practices, 
including by the PRC.

    Question. How would this priority fit with President Biden's 
January 2021 Executive Order that U.S. representatives to international 
financial institutions only support lending and investment to projects 
``in alignment with the Paris Climate Accords''?

    Answer. I agree that the IMF plays a critical role in the global 
economy by supporting countries experiencing economic and financial 
crises. Regarding aligning the IMF's operations with the goals of the 
Paris Agreement, the IMF provides financing to support members' 
balance-of-payments needs; it does not provide project-based lending. 
Under the IMF's climate strategy, country engagements, including for 
lending, will incorporate assessment of the climate impacts of key 
policies to help ensure consistency with countries' targets pursuant to 
the Paris Agreement.

    Question. To your knowledge, has the IMF offered loans to countries 
currently indebted to CCP, such as Sri Lanka, Uganda, and Ecuador?

    Answer. The IMF currently has ongoing financing programs with 
Ecuador and Uganda. In IMF programs where debt is deemed unsustainable, 
the IMF works with countries to incorporate appropriate debt 
restructuring to regain sustainability, and to ensure that all 
creditors, including China, are treated on comparable terms that 
achieve fair burden sharing. IMF country staff remain deeply engaged 
with the Sri Lankan authorities. Due to the country's current debt 
situation, we expect that a significant debt restructuring will be an 
important part of any IMF-backed program of reforms and adjustment.

    Question. If confirmed, will you support lending to these 
countries?

    Answer. I support the IMF's continued robust engagement with member 
countries experiencing balance of payments needs. Any full-fledged IMF 
financing program must incorporate a credible macroeconomic framework 
that could include, where necessary, debt restructuring. In such cases, 
if confirmed, I will continue to press for IMF engagement that 
prioritizes the participation of all parties, including bilateral 
creditors, on an equal basis to ensure that the burden of debt 
restructuring is borne fairly, and I will press the IMF to play its 
critical role in ensuring that members, both debtors and creditors, 
engage appropriately to achieve effective and timely debt restructuring 
outcomes.

    Question. What steps will you take to ensure these countries are 
properly supported by the international community in confronting the 
CCP?

    Answer. I am deeply committed to ensuring that the IMF plays its 
appropriate role in helping member countries respond to their economic 
stability risks, including those stemming from China's irresponsible 
lending practices. If confirmed, I will work closely with Treasury, IMF 
leadership, and like-minded members of the Executive Board to press for 
robust IMF engagement and support to help enable these countries' 
effective recoveries. This will require IMF teams working closely with 
governments to identify and address vulnerabilities. I will also seek 
to require the IMF to hold China to account for past and present 
behavior that undercuts the ability of these countries to establish and 
maintain sustainable economic recoveries.

    Question. At the beginning of this year, the IMF proposed the 
creation of a Resilience and Sustainability Fund, which would grant 
loans to countries contingent on them agreeing to reduce emissions. 
This is just the latest step in a single-minded focus at the IMF and 
other international financial institutions, like the World Bank, to 
prioritize emissions reductions in the face of other, more urgent, 
priorities. Many of the countries most in need of lending to bring 
electricity to their populations, distribute lifesaving medicine, and 
build critical infrastructure to lift their people out of poverty are 
also the lowest emitters. Requiring these countries to cut their 
already low emissions risks needlessly keeping their people poor and 
their governments eager to turn to China for the investment they seek.

   Should the U.S., though the IMF, support making loans to developing 
        countries contingent on their promises to cut current and 
        future emissions? Is this a priority of yours, if confirmed?

    Answer. The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) will provide 
transparent, affordable, longer-term loans to poor and developing 
countries alongside policy reforms to reduce the macroeconomic risks 
posed by pandemics and climate change. Crucially, loans from the RST 
will not be contingent on promises to cut current and future emissions. 
Such loans will be used to help countries strengthen pandemic 
preparedness and support their efforts to respond to a range of 
macroeconomic issues posed by climate change, including reducing their 
vulnerabilities to shocks from dependence on energy supplied by malign 
actors.

    Question. Would the Administration prefer crippling a country's 
economic development and keeping its people poor if it meant keeping 
future emissions in check?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work to ensure that the IMF retains 
its core focus on helping members build stable and robust frameworks 
for economic growth and stability, which includes incorporating the 
economically critical impacts of climate and climate-related policies.

    Question. If confirmed, will you commit to ensuring the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides lending for traditional 
energy projects across the globe, including oil, gas, nuclear and coal?

    Answer. The IMF is not a development bank and does not provide 
project-based lending. The IMF provides financing to countries to 
address their balance of payments problems, and IMF loans are typically 
used to address reserve needs of the central bank or, in limited cases, 
budgetary support. If confirmed, I will support IMF lending that is 
underpinned by credible, country-specific macroeconomic frameworks that 
address its members' energy needs, reflect their economic priorities, 
and incorporate pandemic, climate and other risks where they are macro-
critical and important for the program's success.

    Question. In August 2021, the IMF with the approval of the Biden 
administration issued $650 billion in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)--
the largest in history. The majority of the allocations ended up going 
to those countries that need it the least.

   What was your involvement in the design of the Special Drawing 
        Rights?

    Answer. Secretary Yellen supported the 2021 SDR allocation to help 
address the long-term global need for reserves. In considering the 2021 
allocation, I provided technical-level input to Secretary Yellen in my 
role as Acting Executive Director.

    Question. How much did the United States receive from the $650 
billion in SDR? How did the United States use our SDR?

    Answer. The United States received about $113 billion worth of SDRs 
from the 2021 allocation. Those SDRs, along with all of our previously 
held SDRs and those exchanged with other IMF members, are held in the 
Exchange Stabilization Fund as reserve assets. Since the dollar is the 
world's leading reserve currency, we do not need to ``use'' our SDRs.

    Question. How much did Russia receive from the SDR?

    Answer. In accordance with the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the SDR 
allocation was distributed to all IMF members in proportion to their 
respective IMF quota shares. As such, Russia received approximately 
$17.5 billion in SDRs. Russia has not exchanged any of these SDRs for 
usable currency.

    Question. How much did China receive from the SDR?

    Answer. The SDR allocation was distributed to all IMF members in 
proportion to their respective IMF quota shares. China received 
approximately $42 billion worth of SDRs. China has not exchanged any of 
these SDRs for usable currency.

    Question. How much total funding did developing countries receive 
from the SDR?

    Answer. The SDR allocation was distributed to all IMF members in 
proportion to their respective IMF quota shares. Developing and 
emerging market countries, excluding China, received about $232 billion 
worth of SDRs from the 2021 SDR allocation.

    Question. Why were you unable to get enhanced transparency and 
accountability measures attached to any reallocation effort?

    Answer. As part of the SDR allocation, Treasury successfully 
pressed IMF staff to enhance the details it reports on members' SDR 
holdings and transactions by breaking out transactions into the 
aggregate categories of IMF operations and SDR trading. IMF staff also 
agreed to publish a note on best practices for SDR use to guide their 
country teams and authorities--this note was published in August 2021 
on the IMF's website.\1\ The IMF publishes members' SDR holdings on a 
monthly \2\ and quarterly \3\ basis. In addition, at Treasury's 
request, the IMF started publishing an annual summary update on SDR 
transactions \4\ and has committed to undertaking an ex-post report on 
members' use of SDRs, which it will publish two years after the 
allocation.

    Question. The Biden administration is attempting to turn the IMF 
into a climate change bank. The original intended purpose of the $650 
billion SDR was to help support economic stability. Now, it appears it 
is using those funds to support climate change. On April 13, 2022, the 
Executive Board of the IMF approved the establishment of the Resilience 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
and Sustainability Trust (RST).

   Do you support the establishment of the RST?

    Answer. Treasury has engaged extensively with partners in the G7 
and G20 around the need to increase IMF support for countries to 
address certain longer-term economic risks that can affect global 
economic and financial stability. The Resiliency and Sustainability 
Trust (RST) represents the product of that intensive engagement, and 
will help middle- and lower-income countries address the macroeconomic 
risks of pandemics and climate change, including from energy 
insecurity. If confirmed, I will work with IMF management and like-
minded partners to ensure that the RST remains tied to the IMF's core 
mandate of economic and financial stability.

    Question. Why should we allow these funds, originally meant to help 
support economic stability due to the global pandemic, to be used for 
climate change?

    Answer. As research from the IMF and many other institutions has 
conclusively demonstrated, pandemics, and climate change pose 
substantial and increasing risks to many countries' macroeconomic and 
financial stability. The RST is designed to help countries address 
these risks by including policy conditionality that increases 
resilience to the macroeconomic impacts of pandemics, and climate 
shocks, including from energy insecurity. The RST will be subject to 
the same strong safeguards as traditional IMF lending with IMF 
Executive Board oversight for every RST disbursement.

    Question. Would China be eligible to receive funds under the RST?

    Answer. China has no need for IMF financing; but it has committed 
to lend its SDRs to support the RST. Moreover, even if China did want 
to borrow from the RST it would be unlikely to agree to a regular IMF 
program engagement, which is a precondition for RST eligibility.

    Question. What climate changes policies have you supported while 
serving at the International Monetary Fund?

    Answer. While serving as Acting U.S. Executive Director to the IMF, 
I voted to support the IMF's Strategy to Help Members Address Climate 
Change, which became effective in July 2021. The strategy directs the 
IMF to support members in assessing the macroeconomic impacts of 
climate and climate-related policies, including their impacts on 
financial markets, through its surveillance and technical assistance.

    Question. In a report released in April 2021, the IMF stated ``At 
$1.9 trillion, the Biden administration's new fiscal package is 
expected to deliver a strong boost to growth in the United States in 
2021 and provide sizable positive spillovers to trading partners.'' 
Managing Director of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, explained that 
since the IMF's most recent forecast the ``horizon has darkened.''

   Why did the IMF get it so wrong?

    Answer. The United States experienced the fastest GDP growth in 40 
years in 2021 and the fastest calendar year decline in the unemployment 
rate on record, consistent with the IMF's forecast. U.S. growth would 
inevitably slow once the economy was back to full employment, but 
Russia's unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine has added 
further headwinds that are slowing growth. The most recent IMF forecast 
has lowered estimates of U.S. and global growth based on those 
headwinds.

    Question. Is the U.S. in a recession?

    Answer. U.S. recessions are determined by National Bureau of 
Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee, so I would defer 
to that committee for a full assessment.

    Question. What is the main reason for the decrease in U.S. growth?

    Answer. U.S. growth has slowed in 2021 as the United States 
returned to full employment, and Russia's unprovoked and unjustified 
war against Ukraine has generated a large negative supply shock, 
raising food and energy prices, which has reduced household income and 
may limit households' ability to spend on other goods and services, 
slowing the economy.

    Question. Do you believe the $1.9 trillion Biden spending package 
contributed to inflation?

    Answer. Inflation has risen to high levels in both the United 
States and across nearly all advanced economies. More than half of 
inflation experienced in the United States in 2022 is the result of 
high energy and food prices, exacerbated by Russia's war against 
Ukraine. The United States had high inflation in 2021 due in large 
measure to global supply chain disruptions generated by the ongoing 
pandemic.

    Question. The IMF suspended engagement with Afghanistan until there 
is clarity within the international community of the recognition of the 
Government.

   Under what conditions, if any, would you recommend the United 
        States support the IMF providing special drawing rights or 
        access to resources by the Taliban?

    Answer. The IMF has stated publicly that Afghanistan's access to 
IMF resources and SDRs remains on hold as a consequence of a lack of 
clarity among IMF members regarding recognition of the Government of 
Afghanistan. If confirmed, I will continue to work closely with 
Treasury and the State Department to convey our policy stance with 
respect to Afghanistan, and will engage robustly with IMF management 
and staff to help safeguard Afghanistan's resources for its people.

    Question. How will you balance encouraging unprecedented behavior 
by the Hungarian Government in allowing so many refugees to enter 
Hungary, while also pushing the government to live up to its 
international obligations in supporting them once there?

    Answer. The Government and the people of Hungary have responded in 
an unprecedented way to the Ukrainian refugee crisis. Over 800,000 
people have crossed the border directly from Ukraine to Hungary and 
many thousands more by way of Romania as well. The country mobilized to 
set up receptions centers and shelters to meet basic needs of refugee 
families and to provide health care and integration services. Hungary's 
capacity to accommodate a surge of refugees of this magnitude during 
the current crisis was surely tested. Hungary and its generous people 
should be recognized for that effort.
    Hungary, of course, has been controversial in recent years due to 
its refugee policies, including the criminalization of NGOs for 
providing aid to refugees and limiting access to asylum procedures. 
These policies have likely affected Hungary's ability to respond to the 
current Ukrainian refugee crisis. The slower processing time of 
requests for temporary protective status in Hungary may have 
contributed to lower numbers of Ukrainians receiving that status in 
Hungary than in neighboring countries.
    If confirmed, I would seek to cooperate with the Hungarian 
Government as well as local NGOs and international organizations to 
help build capacity. I would also advocate for the fair and equitable 
treatment of all refugees and asylum seekers and encourage the 
Hungarian Government to meet its international obligations with respect 
to refugees, both from Ukraine or otherwise.

    Question. How will you use your position to advocate for 
independent media in Hungary, and ensure that Hungarians have access to 
accurate and unbiased journalism?

    Answer. I am concerned about declining media pluralism in Hungary, 
as are the leading international press freedom advocates and many 
Hungarians. A diversity of independent voices and opinions is essential 
to democracy, and if I am confirmed I will urge the Government of 
Hungary to promote an open media environment, an environment that is in 
line with EU law. In addition, I would support regional programs to 
build the capacity of independent media. Finally, I would call 
attention to actions that further erode the space for an independent 
media or that fuel disinformation, which threaten the availability of 
accurate information in the public square. Freedom of expression and a 
thriving independent press are vital for the functioning of a 
pluralistic democracy, and the U.S. Government will continue to 
emphasize the importance of media freedom.

    Question. What would be your approach to supporting the LGBT, Roma, 
and other vulnerable communities that face discrimination and abuse in 
Hungarian society?

    Answer. The United States has made advocacy for human rights an 
important element of its foreign policy. If confirmed, I would engage 
vulnerable communities in Hungary directly to learn about their 
experiences first-hand.
    The United States provides support to human rights defenders and 
non-governmental organizations around the world, including in Hungary. 
If confirmed, I would work to strengthen these partnerships in Hungary 
and determine how the United States can optimally support vulnerable 
groups. It is critical that we partner with the Government of Hungary 
on areas of common values to ensure that all people are treated with 
dignity and that their basic human rights are respected.

Anomalous Health Incidents
    Question. I am very concerned about directed energy attacks on U.S. 
Government personnel (so-called Anomalous Health Incidents). Ensuring 
the safety and security of our personnel abroad falls largely on 
individual Chiefs of Mission and the response of officers at post. It 
is imperative that any individual who reports a suspected incident be 
responded to promptly, equitably, and compassionately.

   Do you agree these incidents must be taken seriously, and pose a 
        threat to the health of U.S. personnel?

    Answer. The issue of Anomalous Health Incidents--including the 
interagency effort to protect and care for our personnel and uncover 
the cause of these incidents--is an absolute priority for the 
Department, and it would be an absolute priority for me if I am 
confirmed.
    As the President has said, the health and well-being of American 
public servants is of paramount importance to the Administration. On a 
personal level, I have no higher priority than the safety of the 
members of the Embassy team and their family members.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to ensuring that any reported 
incident is treated seriously and reported quickly through the 
appropriate channels, and that any affected individuals receive prompt 
access to medical care?

    Answer. Yes. Protecting Americans and all those who serve our 
country is our first duty, and I will do everything I can to care for 
our personnel and their families in Hungary.
    The Administration has developed and deployed a standardized 
medical evaluation process for U.S. medical staff who respond to AHI 
reports.
    Embassies around the world have trained their medical staff on how 
to respond to an incident, evaluate affected individuals, and report 
evaluation results to the appropriate medical and security elements 
across the U.S. Government to initiate a holistic response to the 
incident.

    Question. Do you commit to meeting with medical staff and the RSO 
at post to discuss any past reported incidents and ensure that all 
protocols are being followed?

    Answer. Yes. This issue is a top priority, and I would consult with 
the RSO and the Embassy's Health Unit, as well as relevant offices in 
Washington as soon as possible after I arrive to make sure we provide 
maximum support to our personnel and their families in Hungary.

State Department Manangement and Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Budapest?

    Answer. My understanding from the State Department is that morale 
is strong, and the Mission is well-run. The one area in this regard 
that has been flagged as needing attention is the salaries of the 
Locally Employed Staff, which have not kept up with the local cost of 
labor.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Budapest?

    Answer. High morale in a workforce is of the utmost importance, 
both because I am committed to staff being satisfied and fulfilled, and 
because it leads to better performance. If confirmed, I will seek to 
foster a culture of empowerment and open, transparent communication, 
and I will work to create an environment in which all members of the 
team understand the importance of their contribution to advancing U.S. 
foreign policy goals.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Budapest?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will ensure all team members at all levels 
of the Mission understand the strategic priorities of the Mission, 
understand their role in advancing those priorities, and receive 
sufficient support in carrying out those responsibilities.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. My management style is collaborative, inclusive and 
empowering. I believe in creating a work environment in which all 
members of the team are encouraged to think rigorously and creatively 
about challenges we are confronting. I am also a strong proponent of 
open communication and ensuring that people are recognized for the 
important work they do. This includes ensuring that members of the team 
have opportunities to grow and further develop skills in order to 
advance their careers.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No. Berating subordinates is counterproductive and is never 
acceptable. If confirmed, I will treat employees with the utmost 
respect and expect all within the Embassy's leadership to do the same.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work to build a relationship of deep 
trust and mutual respect with the Deputy Chief of Mission, delegating 
when appropriate and empowering him or her to ensure he or she can step 
in for me if I am not available. At the same time, I will remain 
personally accountable for our Mission's success.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. While the exact division of labor will be determined based 
on the interests and skills of the incoming Deputy Chief of Mission, I 
see the role of the Deputy Chief of Mission as both a chief operating 
officer and the right hand and alter ego of the ambassador.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Absolutely. Candid and comprehensive performance reviews 
are essential for employees to know where they stand and for them to 
understand where they need to improve. Beyond the annual reviews, it is 
also important for supervisors to make clear what the expectations are 
and to give continuous constructive feedback.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes. This kind of communication and feedback is fundamental 
to a high functioning and healthy work environment.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Hungary.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. I strongly believe that diplomats need to get outside of 
the embassy in order to effectively advance our interests. It is 
important that our diplomats are doing all that we can to safely engage 
with the broadest cross-section of the countries in which we are 
deployed. Hungary is an environment where this kind of engagement is 
possible and, if confirmed, I would view broad and frequent engagement 
throughout the country as an essential component of our Embassy's work.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will make clear that this kind of outreach 
is a core component of our responsibilities. I will encourage our 
diplomats to engage with and reach into the broadest cross-section of 
communities across Hungary, and will ensure that U.S. diplomats under 
my authority can do so safely.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in the 
Hungary?

    Answer. The majority of Hungarians have a favorable opinion toward 
the United States and support a stronger relationship with the United 
States. In addition, the Hungarian public generally has a positive 
opinion of the United States and NATO in terms of Hungary's national 
security.
    Consolidation of media under government-aligned or state-funded 
control has created a difficult environment, both for the Hungarian 
public to get reliable, unbiased information, and for the U.S. embassy 
to reach all audiences.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. Prevalent disinformation and a shrinking space for 
independent media in Hungary is a challenge to our public diplomacy 
efforts. COVID-19 has also been a significant challenge and had a 
negative impact on in-person public diplomacy and exchange programming 
in Hungary, as it has everywhere.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. Public diplomacy is most effective if it is tailored and 
crafted by those present in a particular country. If confirmed, I will 
work with the Embassy's Public Diplomacy Section to closely coordinate 
the efforts of public diplomacy professionals in both Washington and 
Budapest to ensure that there is a unified, informed, and effective 
approach to advancing our interests through public diplomacy in 
Hungary. The Public Diplomacy Section engages on a variety of different 
social media platforms in both English and Hungarian to deliver 
tailored messages on U.S. foreign policy priorities; promote Embassy 
activities and events; provide information on security, voting, and 
other topics of interest to U.S. citizens; and communicate with the 
Hungarian public.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. The issue of Anomalous Health Incidents--including the 
interagency effort to protect and care for our personnel and uncover 
the cause of these incidents--is an absolute priority for the 
Department, and it would be an absolute priority for me if I am 
confirmed.
    As the President has said, the health and well-being of American 
public servants is of paramount importance to the Administration. On a 
personal level, if confirmed, I will have no higher priority than the 
safety of the members of the Embassy team and their family members.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Budapest personnel?

    Answer. Absolutely. I believe open and transparent communication is 
critical for a workplace to function well, and leadership should set 
the example for that. This is particularly true in the context of 
anomalous health incidents

Human Rights, Democracy, and International Organizations
    Question. In the State Department's 2021 Trafficking in Persons 
Report, Hungary remained on Tier 2 for its ongoing efforts to meet the 
minimum standards to eliminate trafficking but did not adequately do so 
in a few key areas, including failing to appropriately screen third 
country nationals for trafficking indicators, and a failure to 
implement a specialized framework for child victims services. How will 
you work with the Hungarian Government to address these issues if you 
are confirmed as Ambassador?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will ensure Hungarian interlocutors 
understand the United States is committed to combating trafficking in 
persons in Hungary and beyond. While the Hungarian Government is making 
efforts to address this issue, more needs to be done. If confirmed, I 
will encourage the Hungarian Government to increase proactive 
identification and assistance for victims, particularly among 
vulnerable groups to include third-country nationals, and encourage 
consistent and sufficient funding for victim services, including for 
child victims. If confirmed, I will lead Mission Budapest to develop 
and implement both short- and long-term strategies of engagement with 
government officials, business leaders, and civil society in Hungary.

    Question. The office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons 
plays a key role in assisting Ambassadors in promoting anti-trafficking 
work.

   Please describe how you can work with the Ambassador-at-Large to 
        improve Hungary's anti-trafficking work in country.

    Answer. Fighting human trafficking is a priority and, if confirmed, 
I will work closely with the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking 
in Persons and its Ambassador-at-Large to draw on their expertise in 
order to develop plans and programs to work with the Hungarian 
Government to make improvements. I understand that the Office sometimes 
sends its experts to the field for fact-finding and consulting with 
embassies and host governments, which, if confirmed, I would welcome.

    Question. What concrete steps can you, if confirmed, take with your 
mission to help Hungary improve its anti-trafficking efforts?

    Answer. As an initial matter, if confirmed, I will make clear this 
is a priority and ensure Hungarian interlocutors understand the United 
States is committed to combating trafficking in persons in Hungary and 
beyond. If confirmed, I will lead Mission Budapest to develop and 
implement strategies of consistent engagement with government 
officials, private sector leaders, civil society, and the faith-based 
community in order to combat trafficking in Hungary.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, societal respect for religious freedom in Hungary was 
generally lacking, including noted antisemitic incidents and casual 
verbal insults directed at Muslim minorities. What is your assessment 
of this particular issue and if confirmed, how will you work with the 
Ambassador-at-Large to bolster religious freedom in-country?

    Answer. Increasing societal respect for religious freedom and 
religious minorities in Hungary is deeply important. If confirmed, I 
will work closely with the faith-based community, civil society 
organizations, religious minorities, and government entities to 
facilitate dialogue on this issue and identify ways to address it. 
Hungary has a rich faith-based community, and I will strongly promote 
inter-faith dialogue among religious groups in Hungary about this 
challenge. If confirmed, I will work with both the Office of 
International Religious Freedom and the Office of the Special Envoy to 
Monitor and Combat Antisemitism to ensure Mission Hungary identifies 
creative and effective strategies to combat discrimination and promote 
tolerance.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 Human Rights Report, 
Hungary was noted as having several significant human rights abuses, 
including infringement on independence of the judiciary, restrictions 
on free speech and media, refoulement of refugees, and more. It was 
noted the Government did take some steps to address these issues.

   If confirmed, what steps will you take to continue to address these 
        instances with the host government?

    Answer. The United States consistently encourages our Allies and 
partners to continually strengthen democratic processes and 
institutions, including safeguarding the rule of law, judicial 
independence, media freedom, and transparent and accountable 
governance. We hold ourselves to these same standards.
    If confirmed, I will unequivocally engage the Government of Hungary 
about our concerns on these issues. As a member of NATO, the European 
Union, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
Hungary has made commitments and undertaken obligations to democratic 
processes, human rights, and fundamental freedoms. The United States 
and other members of the transatlantic family of nations have called on 
Hungary to uphold those obligations and commitments. If confirmed, I 
will do so as well.

    Question. How will you direct your Embassy to work with civil 
society organizations to improve the human rights situation on the 
ground?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will ensure we strengthen our engagement 
with civil society organizations across Hungary. Civil society has a 
special role to play in holding democracies accountable. If confirmed, 
I will work closely with civil society organizations, as well as 
government entities, to bolster respect for human rights. I will also 
encourage the Government to pursue greater consultation with civil 
society actors and to broaden the space for their activities. We will 
leverage the strength of our civil society partnerships and the depth 
of our public diplomacy tools to engage with Hungarians to defend and 
promote human rights in Hungary and the region.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to personally raising human 
rights issues with the Hungarian Government?

    Answer. Yes. Human rights are a core element of U.S. foreign 
policy, and if confirmed, I will directly and unequivocally engage the 
Government of Hungary on these issues.

    Question. Do you agree with the assessment of many analysts that 
Hungary has devolved to be an authoritarian country or an ``illiberal 
democracy?''

    Answer. Several independent organizations that assess and rank 
countries' democratic standing have downgraded Hungary in recent years, 
including Freedom House. Hungary is a long-time friend, ally, and 
partner of the United States. The United States remains committed to 
strengthening our partnership with Hungary, where we believe the 
threats to democracy are real and merit our determined attention.
    The United States consistently encourages our Allies and partners 
to promote democratic values, including safeguarding the rule of law, 
judicial independence, media freedom, human rights, and transparency. 
We hold ourselves to these same standards.
    Hungary has undertaken commitments to democratic values and 
governance as a member of NATO, the European Union, and the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The United States 
and other members of the transatlantic family of nations have called on 
Hungary to uphold those obligations and commitments. If confirmed, I 
will do so as well.

    Question. If confirmed as Ambassador, how would you encourage 
Hungary to play a more constructive role as a member of NATO and the 
EU, particularly where the Russian invasion of Ukraine is concerned?

    Answer. Hungary is a valued NATO partner making critical 
contributions to our shared defense. As a NATO Ally, Hungary has 
publicly condemned Russia's aggression against Ukraine, including 
supporting the March 2022 Extraordinary Leaders' Statement calling 
Russia's aggression against Ukraine the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic 
security in decades and condemning the full-scale invasion. Hungary 
hosts and commands a NATO Enhanced Vigilance Activities Battle Group, 
and it has regularly participated in other NATO activities to deter 
Russia, including the NATO Baltic Air Policing Mission. Our joint 
training and exercises are a visible example of our cooperation and 
part of a longstanding partnership between our armed forces. We were 
pleased to see U.S. and Hungarian soldiers conducting joint training 
near the Hungary-Ukraine border earlier this month.
    If confirmed, I will continue to work with Hungary to maintain a 
unified response to Putin's aggression. However, there are valid 
concerns among Allies that Hungary hopes to maintain strong ties to 
Russia, primarily due to its dependence on Russian energy. Hungary also 
seeks to maintain connections in other ways as well, including through 
the Budapest-based International Investment Bank. Furthermore, 
Hungary's recent reticence in adopting additional EU sanctions on 
Russia suggests a high degree of influence by Russia on the Hungarian 
government. If confirmed, I would work to tackle Russia's malign 
influence in Hungary and, in addition, encourage Hungary to stop 
impeding high-level meetings of the NATO-Ukraine Commission, to allow 
closer consultation between NATO and Ukrainian leaders at this critical 
moment.

    Question. How would you describe the condition of Hungary's media 
sector?

    Answer. I share the concerns of the leading global press freedom 
advocates, multilateral organizations, and Hungarian citizens, over the 
steady decline of media freedom in Hungary. A diversity of independent 
voices and opinions is essential to democracy. The diversity of the 
media landscape in Hungary has been negatively affected by an 
advertising market highly dependent on government-sponsored advertising 
that has facilitated the concentration of media ownership in the hands 
of a few government-aligned businesspersons, resulting in a lack of 
editorial independence for some outlets.
    Independent media outlets continue to function in Budapest and 
online, and maintain some presence on television, but their reach has 
shrunk considerably. The largest independent radio station was forced 
off the airwaves in 2021, the largest independent daily newspaper shut 
down in 2016, and a government-aligned media group took over the 
largest online news outlet in 2020.
    In March 2020, the government permanently amended the criminal code 
to increase the penalty for spreading a ``falsehood'' or ``distorted 
truth'' (``scaremongering'') that could obstruct ``successful 
protection'' of the public under a declared state of emergency related 
to the COVID-19 pandemic to imprisonment of up to five years. Watchdog 
groups have also expressed concern about less access to government by 
independent media and delays in responding to freedom of information 
requests.

    Question. If confirmed as Ambassador, how would you work to support 
independent media and strengthen freedom of the press?

    Answer. I am concerned about declining media pluralism in Hungary, 
as are the leading international press freedom organizations and many 
Hungarians. A diversity of independent voices and opinions is essential 
to democracy, and if I am confirmed I will urge the Government of 
Hungary to promote an open media environment, an environment that is in 
line with EU law. In addition, I would support regional programs to 
build the capacity of independent media. Finally, I would call 
attention to actions that further erode the space for an independent 
media or that fuel disinformation, which threatens the space for 
accurate information in the public square. Freedom of expression and a 
thriving independent press are vital for the functioning of a 
pluralistic democracy, and the U.S. Government will continue to 
emphasize the importance of media freedom.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
             to Hon. David Pressman by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. How do you characterize Hungary's relations with the U.S. 
today?

    Answer. Hungary is a long-time friend, ally, and partner. Last year 
marked 100 years of bilateral relations between the United States and 
Hungary. We greatly value our partnership with Hungary and all we have 
undertaken together to strengthen global security and grow our trade 
and investment relationship.
    While we have concerns about the malign influence of Russia and 
China in Hungary, Hungary continues to make significant contributions 
to common security objectives such as combating terrorism, 
transnational crime, and weapons proliferation. As a NATO Ally, Hungary 
supports efforts to defend NATO's Eastern Flank at this critical moment 
and has been our partner in addressing challenges around the world, 
including in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Balkans. Hungary is home to 
hundreds of U.S. companies and the citizens of our nations take part in 
rich and growing cultural, education, and scientific exchanges.

    Question. Do you think lecturing Hungary on divisive progressive 
priorities serves U.S. interests or does it push them closer to Russia 
and China?

    Answer. We need to pull Hungary closer to us, not push it away. As 
NATO Allies, the United States and Hungary are connected through our 
commitments to democracy, and we continue to support the Hungarian 
people's pursuit of a democratic future based on respect for human 
rights. There are threats to democracy in Hungary that merit our 
attention. These threats are to democratic institutions and transcend 
political ideology; as allies we should be candid about our concerns 
and collaborate to address them.
    Russia and China's influence has had a corrosive effect on 
democratic institutions in Hungary--and around the world. Moscow and 
Beijing seek to reshape the international order in ways that fortify 
their authoritarian regimes and divide the rest of us. The United 
States, Europe, and democracies everywhere are stronger when we work 
together to advance our shared values. Efforts to advance fair 
competition and transparency, and to protect fundamental rights and 
transatlantic values such as media freedom, rule of law, and human 
rights in Hungary strengthen its government and people to resist the 
corrosive influence of authoritarian regimes like Russia and China.

    Question. How do you describe the Orban Government's view of 
Putin's Russia?

    Answer. Prime Minister Orban has long said he pursues ``pragmatic'' 
cooperation with Russia and has held more bilateral meetings with 
Russian President Vladimir Putin since Russia's 2014 invasion of 
Ukraine than any EU leader, including a February meeting with Putin in 
Moscow just three weeks before Putin launched his full-scale invasion 
of Ukraine. Hungarian leaders have stated they still consider Russia a 
reliable economic partner providing cheap energy, investment 
opportunities, and an export market. I have a different view.
    Hungary's leaders and some media outlets have also provided a 
platform for repeating the Kremlin's narratives on international issues 
while ignoring or downplaying Russia's destabilizing actions in 
Europe--views, I might add, at odds with the majority of Hungarians, 
who continue to view the United States and Europe as Hungary's most 
important partners.
    At the same time, since February 24, Prime Minister Orban and 
Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto have emphasized Hungary's commitments 
to NATO and the EU, going along with six successive EU sanctions 
packages; agreeing to the establishment of a NATO Enhanced Vigilance 
Activities Battle Group in Hungary; and publicly condemning Russia's 
aggression against Ukraine.

    Question. What is your assessment of Hungary's views of the EU's 
sanctions against Russia?

    Answer. Despite Hungary's close relationship with Russia, Hungary 
ultimately supported the EU's anti-Russia sanctions packages (six to 
date) introduced after Russia's most recent invasion of Ukraine. 
Hungary also agreed to and enforced earlier sanctions that followed 
Russia's 2014 invasion. The Government has publicly said that sanctions 
on Russian energy would severely harm Hungary's economy, given its 
dependence on Russian gas and oil, and the EU's sixth sanctions package 
includes significant exemptions for oil imports to landlocked countries 
like Hungary. The Government's public messaging on sanctions often 
seeks to blame sanctions, rather than Russia, for the negative economic 
consequences of Russia's war.

    Question. To what extent does the Hungarian Government view Russia 
as a security threat?

    Answer. As a NATO member, Hungary has supported the Alliance view 
on Russia, including the March 2022 Extraordinary Leaders' Statement 
calling Russia's aggression the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic 
security in decades and condemning the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
Hungary hosts and commands a NATO Enhanced Vigilance Activities Battle 
Group, and it has regularly participated in other NATO activities to 
deter Russia, including the NATO Baltic Air Policing Mission. Our close 
intelligence sharing ahead of Russia's full-scale invasion has helped 
reveal the true nature of the Kremlin's threat to European security to 
Allies and the world.
    However, there are valid concerns among Allies that Hungary hopes 
to maintain strong ties to Russia, primarily due to its dependence on 
Russian energy. It seeks to maintain connections in other ways as well. 
For example, the Budapest-based International Investment Bank (IIB) may 
provide the Kremlin with opportunities to evade the crippling sanctions 
it must now deal with as the result of its unprovoked and brutal 
invasion of Ukraine. We think the bank is a vulnerability for Hungary 
and the Alliance. I should also note that every other EU member state 
that had participated as a shareholder in the IIB has announced its 
intention to withdraw from it.

    Question. How do you assess Hungary's relationship with China?

    Answer. Hungary's efforts to forge closer ties with the People's 
Republic of China is a key element of the Orban administration's 
``Eastern opening'' strategy that it has pursued since returning to 
power in 2010. Hungary was one of the first European Union countries to 
join China's Belt and Road Initiative, and the only European Union 
country to not participate in the Trump administration's ``clean 
network'' initiative. As an ally and friend, it is important that we 
work with Hungary to highlight the risks posed by Beijing's influence 
and investments.
    Additionally, Hungary has taken steps to block or weaken 
multilateral statements about the People's Republic of China's conduct 
in Hong Kong and its treatment of the Uyghurs, among other issues. If 
confirmed, I would continue to engage with our Hungarian partners to 
join us in holding Beijing accountable for its actions.

    Question. How does the Hungarian Government view the conflict in 
Ukraine?

    Answer. Hungary has generally supported the Alliance view on 
Russia, including the March 2022 Extraordinary Leaders' Statement 
calling Russia's aggression the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic 
security in decades and condemning the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
The Government recognizes that Russia's aggression has destabilized 
European security, caused enormous human suffering, and prompted the 
flight of hundreds of thousands of people across Hungarian territory.

    Question. How do you assess Hungary's response to the war in 
Ukraine?

    Answer. Hungary has agreed to six successive EU sanctions packages, 
the establishment of a NATO Enhanced Vigilance Activities Battle Group 
in Hungary, and EU funding for weapons for Ukraine. Hungary has 
provided humanitarian assistance to hundreds of thousands of refugees 
entering Hungary and to displaced persons in Ukraine and publicly 
condemned Russia's aggression against Ukraine. At the same time, Prime 
Minister Orban has prohibited the delivery of lethal weapons to Ukraine 
through Hungary; resisted stronger EU sanctions against Russia; and 
publicly criticized President Zelenskyy as a political adversary. 
Hungary cannot be neutral in this larger struggle--Hungary is a NATO 
Ally and EU member state. If confirmed, I will continue to work with 
Hungary to maintain a unified response to Putin's aggression.

    Question.  How do you assess Hungary's contributions to NATO and 
its role as a U.S. security partner?

    Answer. In the security sphere, Hungary is a NATO partner making 
significant contributions to our shared defense. After Russia's full-
scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Hungary was one of the first 
countries to become a framework nation for a NATO Enhanced Vigilance 
Activities battlegroup. The Government has reaffirmed its intention to 
spend at least two percent of GDP on defense by 2024. Hungary has 
roughly 900 troops deployed in support of NATO, EU, UN, and U.S.-led 
missions, including about 160 troops in Iraq. In October 2021, Hungary 
took command of NATO's Kosovo Force (KFOR), the country's (and NATO's) 
largest foreign troop deployment and a reflection of Hungary's 
willingness to assume responsibility in a region of critical importance 
to Hungary and to European security. Hungary will take over the NATO 
Baltic Air Policing Mission in August. Hungary also hosts the NATO 
Multinational Division-Center in Szekesfehervar, a Hungarian initiative 
led by framework nations Hungary, Croatia, and Slovakia that eventually 
will fit into the NATO Force. We also thank Hungary for its assistance 
to 540 Afghans and 61 U.S. citizens and legal residents during the 
August 2021 evacuation effort, in which Hungary used its own military 
aircraft.

Timely Briefings
    Question. It is my expectations that the State Department provides 
briefings to me and my staff in an expeditious manner.

   Do you commit to being responsive and expeditious in responding to 
        requests for information from the committee and Congress as a 
        whole?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to being responsive and expeditious 
in responding to requests for information from the committee and 
Congress as a whole.

All-of-the-Above Energy Strategy
    Question. This seemingly innocuous term that is casually spoken by 
both Democrats and Republicans may sound simple and common sense, but 
in reality is highly problematic, especially with respect to foreign 
energy development. ``All-of-the-Above'' literally suggests the U.S. 
should continue to support (i.e. provide foreign assistance or 
development finance for) things like: unmitigated coal, waste 
incineration for energy (also without mitigating emissions), and heavy 
fuel oil for electricity generation. This cannot be U.S. foreign 
policy. In fact, I'm pretty sure it isn't, and as such I think we need 
to stop saying it. I have to imagine many, if not most, of my 
Republican colleagues if asked ``do you believe the U.S. should support 
building highly polluting energy projects in developing countries?'' 
would answer ``NO!''

   Do you believe an ``All-of-the-Above'' energy strategy should 
        include ALL sources of power production, including highly 
        polluting and highly inefficient sources of power?

    Answer. On day one President Biden took executive actions to ensure 
we tackle the climate crisis at home and abroad through a whole-of-
government approach. I believe that an ``All-of-the-Above'' energy 
strategy takes heed of underlying climate concerns, and therefore does 
not include highly polluting and highly inefficient sources of power. 
U.S. energy security and geostrategic concerns necessitate considering 
all energy options, but environmental concerns should be factored in 
throughout. If confirmed, I will work with my ENR team and other 
members of the interagency to implement an energy strategy in line with 
Administration priorities.

    Question. If ``we''--members of Congress, Administration officials, 
talking heads in the media--are going to continue to use this term, 
will you commit to working with Congress to transparently clarify the 
term to have a socially and environmentally responsible meaning?

    Answer. If I am confirmed, I commit to ensuring the term ``all of 
the above'' continues to have a socially and environmentally 
responsible meaning.

The Global Nature of the Energy Crisis
    Question. The impact of Putin's war on Ukraine is reverberating 
throughout the world and is affecting global energy supplies. Yes, our 
allies in Europe are hurting, but the energy crisis is also impacting 
vulnerable populations everywhere in Haiti, The Pacific Islands, the 
Horn of Africa, Central America.

   What are we doing to help other countries, more vulnerable 
        countries, weather the effects of this energy crisis?

    Answer. The Department of State is committed to working with allies 
and partners, including the most vulnerable countries, to weather the 
energy crisis and meet their energy security needs. The Bureau of 
Energy Resources' technical assistance programs promote energy 
diversification and decarbonization, including adoption of clean energy 
sources. This work enables vulnerable countries to better mitigate the 
effects of this energy crisis and help meet their energy security 
needs. If I am confirmed, I will continue to support efforts that help 
countries increase their access to affordable, clean, sustainable, 
secure, and reliable energy, recognizing that renewable energy options 
will often be the surest route to address these multiple goals.

    Question. Are the optics of the U.S. focus on helping Europe 
through the energy crisis, and its majority White populations and High-
Income Countries, concerning to the Administration?

    Answer. The Administration is working tirelessly with partners and 
allies around the world to mitigate the consequences of Russia's war of 
aggression against Ukraine. The Department of State and its partners 
coordinate efforts to promote energy diversification and 
decarbonization globally, including accelerating the adoption of clean 
energy sources in vulnerable countries outside of Europe to better 
mitigate the impacts future energy crises. If confirmed, I will support 
expanding the visibility of U.S.-led global energy initiatives, 
including ENR's work around the world to build reliable, sustainable, 
and transparent supply chains for the critical minerals essential to 
the clean energy transition.

    Question. Many U.S. offices have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout the Bureau of Energy Resources?

    Answer. I worked closely with Bureau of Energy Resources team 
members during my previous assignments and during this confirmation 
process. I am extremely impressed by their dedication to service, their 
incredible level of regional and technical expertise, and their ability 
to perform under the adverse conditions of COVID-19. If confirmed, it 
will be an honor to lead such a tremendous team.
    Bureau team members are working to address the difficult challenges 
of energy security, energy access, and decarbonization. Energy market 
imbalances, Putin's unjustified war in Ukraine, and his weaponization 
of energy, have combined to make this an unprecedented and stressful 
time to work in the energy space. The staff have worked tirelessly with 
their State Department, interagency, and international counterparts on 
these front-page issues, at some personal risk of illness.
    While I am inspired by ENR's adaptability and ability to perform 
under competing pressures, I am cognizant of the morale challenges the 
current situation places upon staff. If confirmed, I will work to 
ensure they have all the resources they need to do their jobs, and to 
do them safely.

    Question. Many U.S. offices have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. How do you intend to 
improve morale at the Bureau of Energy Resources?

    Answer. If confirmed, I pledge to lead the Bureau of Energy 
Resources (ENR) team through example, to recognize their outstanding 
work, and to provide these dedicated public servants the support, 
guidance, and resources they need so that our shared diplomatic mission 
succeeds. Given the depth of Civil Service expertise in the Bureau, it 
will be particularly important to ensure that these talented officers 
have opportunities for long-term career growth and advancement. If 
confirmed, I will prioritize communicating with all Bureau team members 
and strive to achieve the highest possible team spirit and morale.
    The State Department is now administering the 2022 Office of 
Personnel Management Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey. I will work 
closely with team members to address any opportunities for improvement 
that ENR survey results identify, as well as work to further amplify 
ENR's strengths.
    If confirmed, I will work to ensure that ENR team members have the 
resources to do their jobs, to ensure their viewpoints are heard and 
included in the policy process, and to make them full partners in the 
work of energy diplomacy.

    Question. Many U.S. offices have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. How do you intend to 
create a unified mission and vision at the Bureau of Energy Resources?

    Answer. A unified vision and clear communication are vital to 
successful diplomatic outcomes. The Administration has laid out the 
important policy goals of energy security, energy access, and 
decarbonization, and I agree that these goals are both overlapping and 
reinforcing. Advancing these objectives by leveraging the expertise of 
the staff remains the core guiding focus of the Bureau, and I would 
work to put specific goals into concrete lines of effort. If confirmed, 
I will work with State Department and international counterparts to 
advance these goals, and to ensure we do so in a coordinated, 
deliberate manner that takes into consideration all relevant 
information, including any underlying stressors. The cooperation of 
allies and partners is critical, as is fostering partnerships with 
international institutions.
    As I said in my prepared statement, energy is front page news right 
now. Senator Lugar recognized, in calling attention to these issues 
some two decades ago, that our success requires persistent and 
strategically focused diplomacy to bolster our international energy 
partnerships. If confirmed, I would be honored to contribute to that 
task, in partnership with the Congress.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for senior officials. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I think those who have worked with me would describe my 
leadership and management style as visionary. In my roles as Ambassador 
and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, I have aimed to empower my 
teams and help them advance the most ambitious possible future for 
themselves and for U.S. interests. In my experience, a key element of 
organizational leadership is translating big strategic objectives into 
concrete lines of effort. If confirmed, I would seek to draw on the 
best of ENR's exceptional team of Civil Service and Foreign Service 
experts to provide the strongest possible policy inputs on 
international energy security, strategic resource, and energy 
transition issues.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for senior officials. 
Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to berate 
subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No. I believe it is always more productive and effective to 
deliver praise in public, and to provide constructive feedback in 
private, in a respectful and helpful manner so that core competencies 
can improve.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for senior officials. 
How do you envision your leadership relationship with your deputy 
assistant secretary?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to working collaboratively in 
full partnership with the Bureau principal deputy assistant secretary 
and deputy assistant secretaries (DASes). I think it is important to 
give specific lines of effort to the DASes, and to inspire them to 
achieve those goals as one team. It will be vital that we work closely 
together and coordinate as we represent the United States in 
international organizations, like the International Energy Agency, and 
the International Renewable Energy Agency, as well as at bilateral and 
strategic dialogues and partnerships, such as the

Minerals Security Partnership
    Question. Management is a key responsibility for senior officials. 
If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you intend to entrust 
to your deputy assistant secretary?

    Answer. I have had the opportunity to serve as a principal deputy 
assistant secretary (PDAS) in a regional Bureau. In that role, I was 
able to handle specific issues for the Bureau and am grateful I was 
empowered to do so. If confirmed, I will seek to empower the ENR PDAS 
and DASes with clear functional and regional specific responsibilities 
and initiatives, so that they can collectively advance overall Bureau 
goals as part of a team. ENR advances clean energy and climate goals 
while representing the United States at important international 
organizations, in regional and bilateral dialogues, and State-led 
initiatives like the Minerals Security Partnership. I will work with 
the ENR DASes to further U.S. goals in all these endeavors.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking. Do 
you believe that it is important to provide employees with accurate, 
constructive feedback on their performances in order to encourage 
improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their roles?

    Answer. Yes. I view the EER process not as something to address on 
April 15, but every day. It is important to maintain a candid dialogue 
with rated and reviewed colleagues throughout the rating period, to 
have honest counseling sessions, to document them, and to inspire staff 
and provide them opportunities to grow their core competencies. I 
believe it is important to encourage staff not to be afraid of making 
mistakes, but to face them, correct them, and learn from them.
    I believe that both the Bureau and the Department awards processes 
play important roles in recognizing the work of our best officers. I am 
a strong advocate of constructive risk taking in our diplomacy and if 
confirmed will seek to create a bureau culture that encourages 
diversity of perspectives and innovative thinking. Aside from producing 
better ideas, this approach is a priority for our successful economic 
statecraft. If confirmed, I will strive to assure that good work gets 
noticed, that career advancing opportunities are open to all staff, and 
that teammates are motivated to reach their full potential.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking. If 
confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, accurate, and direct 
feedback to employees in order to improve performance and reward high 
achievers?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will encourage clear, accurate, respectful, 
and direct feedback. All officers can grow in their careers, and it is 
my responsibility as a manager to give them the tools to do so. Clear 
and accurate employee evaluations are also mission critical, as they 
enable the Department to identify and advance its most capable leaders.

        to Hon. Geoffrey R. Pyatt by Senator Benjamin L. Cardin

Economic Support Funds
    Question. In both FY 2022 and FY 2023, the Biden administration 
requested $30.50 million in ESF funding for the Bureau of Energy 
Resources (ENR), intended for investment in projects or assistance 
efforts to bolster energy security. This amount is nearly $25 million 
more than the State Department allocated in FY 2021.

   In your view, will the ENR bureau be able to absorb increased 
        foreign assistance resources and spend them effectively?

    Answer. The Department's Bureau of Energy Resources can absorb the 
requested funds. ENR foreign assistance helps allies and partners 
oversee their energy and mineral sectors to strengthen energy security, 
transition to a net-zero emissions future, and increase energy 
diversification and access. This funding request is critical to 
achieving the Administration's climate goals and reaching the $11.4 
billion annual climate finance goal laid out by the President. Ensuring 
energy security and combating the climate crisis necessitate increased 
U.S leadership and diplomacy; they also require increased assistance 
resources to drive critical and timely energy sector reforms, and 
develop international partner capacity to accelerate the global energy 
transition. ENR will leverage its experience managing assistance to 
more than 50 countries over the past decade to advance U.S. energy and 
climate policy, including in-depth work in countries and regions such 
as Ukraine, Central America, and across the Indo-Pacific.

    Question. In your view, what are the principal benefits and 
drawbacks to the United States of increasing its exports of LNG to 
Europe?

    Answer. One of the consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 
February 24, 2022, is a fundamental realignment of the geopolitics of 
energy and global energy trade. As Europe's energy security is 
threatened by Russia's drastic reduction in natural gas deliveries, 
assisting our allies and partners with additional LNG exports is in the 
U.S. national interest. Global geopolitical structures are changing and 
new threats are emerging that require a strong and adaptable Europe. 
Efforts to diversify and increase LNG supplies to Europe are being 
executed in alignment with climate objectives and in parallel with 
equally important efforts to reduce overall energy demand and 
accelerate deployment of clean and renewable energy.

    Question. How might LNG exports enhance our national security and 
what are the key geopolitical considerations?

    Answer. As a net exporter of natural gas since 2017, the United 
States has greatly enhanced the flexibility of the global LNG market by 
reaching over 40 countries due to its contracts without destination 
clauses and indexing to Henry Hub instead of oil prices. Although 
Europe's long-term goal is to decarbonize its economy, it is facing an 
energy security problem that U.S. LNG can help address in the short- 
and medium-term. In 2021, U.S. exports to Asia increased by 51 percent 
driven by surging demand from top importers Republic of Korea, PRC, 
Japan, and India. As the third largest supplier to Asia after Australia 
and Qatar, the United States plays a critical role in supplying Asia's 
largest economies and trading partners.

    Question. Both the Trump and Biden administrations identified 
critical minerals as a key component of several supply chains, 
including semiconductors and military hardware. However, our 
adversaries such as Beijing and Moscow are making strides to dominate 
the critical mineral market. For example, China processes approximately 
90 percent of the world's rare earth elements, 55 percent of the 
world's lithium, and 65 percent of the world's cobalt.

   What steps could the U.S. Government take to diversify critical 
        mineral supply chains and expand the role of U.S. firms in 
        extraction and processing sectors outside of the United States?

    Answer. Building diverse, secure critical mineral supply chains is 
a key focus of the Administration and a top priority of the State 
Department Bureau of Energy Resources (ENR). In 2019, ENR launched the 
Energy Resource Governance Initiative (ERGI) to improve governance in 
key mining countries through diplomatic engagement and technical 
assistance, thereby leveling the playing field for companies from the 
United States and likeminded countries. The Minerals Security 
Partnership (MSP), established on June 14, is designed to further 
advance global critical minerals supply chain security. Developed by 
the State Department in close coordination with partner countries, the 
MSP aims to catalyze investment from governments and the private sector 
for strategic critical minerals mining, processing, and recycling 
projects that adhere to high environmental, social, and governance 
standards.

    Question. What additional avenues, if any, is the Biden 
administration exploring for multilateral cooperation on critical 
mineral supply chains beyond existing fora such as the EU-U.S.-Japan 
Trilateral Conference on Critical Minerals?

    Answer. The State Department has intensified critical minerals 
engagement in multilateral fora and bilaterally with key countries. The 
Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), established on June 14, aims to 
bolster critical mineral supply chains. Developed by the State 
Department in close coordination with MSP partner countries, the MSP 
will help catalyze investment from governments and the private sector 
for strategic critical minerals mining, processing, and recycling 
projects that adhere to high environmental, social, and governance 
standards. In addition to the United States, current MSP partners 
include Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, the 
Republic of Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the European 
Commission.
    In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S., UK, Canada, 
and Australia have announced bans on Russian oil imports. This is a 
positive development, but it defies logic that the Biden administration 
is not unleashing our own supply of energy to help assist our allies as 
they reorient away from Russia. Instead, this administration has sought 
assistance from the Maduro regime in Venezuela.

    Question. What is Venezuela's excess oil production today?

    Answer. Venezuela's oil production has fallen from approximately 
2.8 million bpd in 2013 to an estimated 636,000 bpd in 2021, following 
U.S. sanctions and years of corruption and mismanagement of the oil 
sector.

    Question. Hypothetically, what would Maduro use this new influx of 
U.S. dollars for?

    Answer. Our overall sanctions policy on Venezuela remains 
unchanged, and we will continue to implement and enforce our Venezuela 
sanctions in support of a return to democracy in Venezuela. Sanctions 
targeting actors in the Venezuelan oil sector, including state-owned 
oil company PDVSA, have deprived Maduro of revenue that would otherwise 
be generated by oil trade. The U.S. Government continues to prioritize 
limiting revenue flows to the Maduro regime that may result from its 
oil related activities.

    Question. What, in your view, is the Administration's objection to 
supporting and expanding our own domestic energy, which has been proven 
to be cleaner and safer than other countries?

    Answer. I do not believe the Administration objects to supporting 
and expanding our own domestic energy, but I would defer on domestic 
energy policy formulation and implementation to domestic agencies. In 
both of my Ambassadorial postings, I have actively supported U.S. 
energy companies overseas, including in both the fossil fuel and 
renewable sectors. American companies have tripled LNG exports to 
Europe this year and are working towards supplying 50 billion cubic 
meters per year of additional LNG from the United States between now 
and 2030. I also welcome the steps American industry has taken to 
reduce its carbon footprint, through reducing flaring, carbon and 
methane abatement, and exploration of additional clean and renewable 
energy sources and decarbonizing technologies.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
           to Hon. Geoffry R. Pyatt by Senator John Barrasso

    Question. If confirmed, what would be your top three energy 
priorities while serving in this position?

    Answer. If I am confirmed, I would deepen ENR's approach to 
advancing U.S. interests in three main areas: energy security, 
decarbonization in support of the clean energy transition, and energy 
access. I will continue to prioritize working closely with our allies 
and partners to ensure our energy security with a coordinated response 
to Putin's unjustified war. I will advocate for energy diversification, 
increased efficiencies, and accelerating the deployment of clean and 
renewable technologies, because the clean energy transition is key to 
our long-term energy security. I recognize that demand for access to 
energy continues to grow, particularly in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. 
I believe this growth in demand presents an economic opportunity, and I 
commit to continuing ENR's diplomatic and programmatic support for U.S. 
energy companies, particularly clean energy companies, that want to 
invest globally and create jobs and prosperity in the United States and 
overseas. Finally, if I am confirmed, I will further support ENR's work 
to help build secure, reliable, and transparent mineral supply chains 
so that no one country dominates the materials that are critical inputs 
to the clean energy transition.

    Question. If confirmed, would you ensure that the State Department 
is promoting all forms of energy projects across the globe, including 
oil, gas, and coal?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would support energy projects across the 
globe that are consistent with U.S. national security goals. The 
Administration has clearly stated that the clean energy transition will 
be the best solution for addressing the long-term climate crisis. In 
certain cases, however, and depending on the scope of the engagement 
and geostrategic objectives, support for fossil fuel projects may be 
justified, including for national security reasons.

    Question. With billions of people without power, do you believe the 
U.S. should be promoting fossil fuels that are affordable and reliable, 
such as coal and natural gas, while supporting new technologies that 
reduce their carbon output?

    Answer. If confirmed by the Senate, I would promote a range of 
energy options consistent with the Administration's policy and each 
country's unique circumstances to help our global allies and partners 
meet their energy security needs, and ensure affordable and reliable 
access to energy. In certain cases, and depending on the scope of the 
engagement and geostrategic objectives, support for fossil fuel 
projects may be justified, including for national security reasons. In 
certain instances, increasing access to power by leapfrogging outdated 
infrastructure and technology may be a more optimal solution than 
fossil fuels that contribute to environmental damage and health impacts 
due to air pollution. In some instances, renewable sources of energy 
like wind and solar, supported by grid-scale battery storage, could 
provide reliable and more affordable power to many people who struggle 
to access and pay for energy from fossil fuels.

    Question. How should the State Department evaluate and consider 
ongoing sanction programs that prohibit or discourage energy exports?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would recommend that the State Department 
evaluate and consider ongoing energy sanctions programs that advance 
American interests and are consistent with broader U.S. foreign policy 
goals and U.S. legislation.

    Question. Do you support the lifting of U.S. energy sanctions on 
Iran and Venezuela?

    Answer. Any potential changes in our sanctions posture with respect 
to Iran's and Venezuela's oil sectors would be based on a consideration 
of the entire range of relevant foreign policy considerations.
    A mutual return to full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive 
Plan of Action (JCPOA) is the best available option to constrain Iran's 
nuclear program and provide a platform to address Iran's other 
destabilizing conduct. If Iran were prepared to return to full 
implementation of the JCPOA's limits on its nuclear program, the United 
States would be prepared to lift sanctions necessary to return to full 
implementation of the JCPOA, including certain sanctions related to 
Iran's petroleum sector. However, we do not support lifting energy 
sanctions on Iran absent a mutual return to full implementation of the 
JCPOA.
    While the Administration does not preview sanctions actions, we 
have made clear that we would review our sanctions policies in response 
to constructive steps by the Maduro regime and if the Venezuelan 
parties made meaningful progress in the Venezuelan-led negotiations in 
Mexico. Venezuelan-led negotiations between the Maduro regime and the 
Unitary Platform represent the best path to restore to Venezuelans the 
democracy that they deserve and to alleviate their suffering.

    Question. Do you support a prohibition on uranium imports and 
enrichment services from Russia?

    Answer. As a result of Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion 
of Ukraine, the United States has intensified its efforts to work 
closely with allies and partners to identify ways to reduce and 
ultimately eliminate energy dependence on Russia, including in nuclear 
energy. Several countries already have taken important steps in this 
direction.
    At home, the State Department is working with other Departments and 
Agencies, including the Department of Energy, to identify domestic 
solutions that support our foreign policy goals.
    We remain committed to working with Congress to reduce our reliance 
on all Russian energy sources, including those related to civil nuclear 
energy.

    Question. The Eastern Mediterranean Pipeline can help enhance 
European energy security. As the U.S. Ambassador to Greece, you tweeted 
about the Eastern Mediterranean Pipeline deal. You stated, ``Assistant 
Secretary @frank--fannon puts it just right--``Pleased to see Greece, 
Cyprus, and Israel advance #energycooperation in the region--continuing 
our work from the 3+1 in August--by signing the Tripartite Agreement 
for the East Med Energy Corridor.'' In January, the Biden 
Administration announced their opposition to the Eastern Mediterranean 
Pipeline. What is your position on the Eastern Mediterranean Pipeline?

    Answer. My tenure as Ambassador to Greece saw important progress in 
U.S. engagement with the Eastern Mediterranean, including the launch of 
the 3+1 process now led by Secretary Blinken, securing of U.S. observer 
status in the East Mediterranean Gas Forum, and Congressional passage 
of the Eastern Mediterranean Security and Energy Partnership Act of 
2019. Against this background, the United States remains strongly 
committed to physically interconnecting East Mediterranean and Middle 
East energy to Europe. Putin's aggression in Ukraine and subsequent 
actions to disrupt gas supplies to European consumers only underscores 
the U.S. Government's longstanding position that energy cooperation in 
the East Mediterranean provides a foundation for durable energy 
security and economic prosperity in the East Mediterranean region and 
the rest of Europe. Bearing in mind our climate priorities, the 
Administration intends to continue to focus our efforts on electricity 
interconnectors that can support both natural gas and renewable energy 
sources. A hypothetical new pipeline such as the Eastern Mediterranean 
Gas Pipeline (EMGP), for which no financing or business case has been 
identified, would not contribute to European energy security in the 
short or even medium term. Questions for the Record Submitted to

    Question. The Eastern Mediterranean Pipeline can help enhance 
European energy security. As the U.S. Ambassador to Greece, you tweeted 
about the Eastern Mediterranean Pipeline deal. You stated, ``Assistant 
Secretary @frank--fannon puts it just right--``Pleased to see Greece,

our work from the 3+1 in August--by signing the Tripartite Agreement 
for the East Med Energy Corridor.'' In January, the Biden 
Administration announced their opposition to the Eastern Mediterranean 
Pipeline. Given the need to help Europe diversify their routes and 
supplies away from Russian energy resources, what should be the 
Administration's stance on the Eastern Mediterranean Pipeline?

    Answer. Putin's aggression in Ukraine and subsequent actions to 
disrupt gas supplies to European consumers only underscores our 
longstanding position that energy cooperation in the East Mediterranean 
provides a foundation for durable energy security and economic 
prosperity in the East Mediterranean region and the rest of Europe. We 
remain committed to physically interconnecting East Mediterranean and 
Middle East energy to Europe. The Administration's stance on the 
Eastern Mediterranean Gas Pipeline (EMGP) has not changed. We are 
continuing to shift our focus to electricity interconnectors that can 
support both natural gas and renewable energy sources. A new pipeline 
such as the EMGP, which is not even under construction, would not 
contribute to European energy security in the immediate or even medium 
term. We welcome the agreement reached June 15th among Israel, Egypt, 
and the EU to provide additional gas from the East Mediterranean to 
Europe via LNG. This agreement takes advantage of existing 
infrastructure and will directly improve Europe's energy security over 
the short term by reducing dependence on Russian energy sources.

This is an EU project and financing this pipeline is a decision for the 
EU and any potential investors to make.

Administration announced their opposition to the Eastern Mediterranean 
Pipeline. How would development of new natural gas discoveries in the 
Eastern Mediterranean or elsewhere support U.S. objectives of promoting 
energy security and lowering energy prices for U.S. consumers? ?

    Answer. The U.S. Government has supported efforts, including by 
U.S. companies, to develop natural gas resources in the Eastern 
Mediterranean as part of our policy to support diversification of 
energy sources and routes in Europe and to encourage cooperation among 
regional friends and allies. Any new natural gas discoveries in the 
East Mediterranean or elsewhere will not address near-term global 
energy security issues nor lower current energy prices for U.S. 
consumers.

    Question. Gazprom has been halting gas deliveries to a number of 
European countries. What would you suggest the US and our European 
allies do in response to Gazprom's actions?

    Answer. The United States and the European Union are working in 
concert to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Through 
the U.S.-European Commission Joint Task Force on Energy Security, 
announced on March 25 by President Biden and European Commission 
President von der Leyen, the United States is working with the EU to 
diversify liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies to Europe in alignment 
with climate objectives, reducing demand for natural gas, and 
accelerating deployment of clean and renewable energy sources. The EU 
is taking concrete steps separate from the task force, including 
through its REPowerEU plan, announced on March 8, which aims to reduce 
and ultimately eliminate dependence on Russian natural gas, goals the 
U.S. supports.

    Question. Gazprom has been halting gas deliveries to a number of 
European countries. What countries has Russia stopped delivering 
natural gas to? What actions are those countries taking to mitigate the 
impact of being cut off from Russian natural gas?

    Answer. As of June 23, 2022, Russia has halted natural gas supplies 
to Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Poland. The 
EU is taking concrete steps to reduce dependence on Russian natural 
gas, including through its REPowerEU plan, which aims to reduce 
dependence on Russian natural gas by two-thirds by the end of 2022 and 
to eliminate dependence on Russian fossil fuels before 2030. To 
mitigate the impact of Russian cutoffs, the EU is seeking additional 
natural gas supply globally, including from Egypt, Israel, Algeria, 
Azerbaijan, Nigeria, Senegal, and Angola, in addition to increased LNG 
imports from the United States. The EU is also setting out contingency 
measures in case of severe supply disruption.

    Question. Gazprom has been halting gas deliveries to a number of 
European countries. Are European Union member states prepared and able 
to meet their energy needs without Russian imports?

    Answer. EU Member States are working to reduce their dependence on 
Russian fossil fuels, but this will take time. The EU imported from 
Russia more than 40 percent of its total gas consumption, 27 percent of 
oil imports, and 46 percent of coal in 2021. The EU is taking steps to 
reduce this dependency and establish contingency measures in case of 
severe supply disruption, including phased bans on imports of Russian 
coal and seaborne oil, and its REPowerEU plan to make Europe 
independent from Russian fossil fuels by 2030. We support these efforts 
through regular coordination and joint initiatives, such as the U.S.-
European Commission Joint Task Force to Reduce Europe's Dependence on 
Russian Fossil Fuels.

    Question. Gazprom has been halting gas deliveries to a number of 
European countries. Under what circumstances and conditions could 
European Union member states stop receiving Russian natural gas imports 
from Nord Stream 1?

    Answer. Gazprom has announced reduced natural gas flows through 
Nord Stream 1 to Germany by up to 60 percent and Russia could institute 
further natural gas flow decreases and cutoffs. Individual EU member 
states have different levels of dependencies on Russian fossil fuels 
and options and abilities to reduce them. These efforts involve 
numerous steps, including increasing LNG imports from non-Russian 
sources, reducing overall energy demand, and accelerating deployment of 
renewables and clean energy solutions. These efforts are difficult and 
will take time.

    Question. The United States has the energy resources needed to help 
our allies reduce their dependence on Russian energy. Our nation should 
be a strategic energy supplier to Europe. American natural gas is 
reliable, affordable, and abundant. It is an important energy solution 
for those who want to keep their lights on without empowering Russia. 
Do you support increasing exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
to help our allies and partners escape their dependence on Russia?

    Answer. I fully support the President's commitment to helping our 
European allies and partners reduce their dependence on Russian gas, 
including through the provision of American LNG, reducing their overall 
demand for energy, and accelerating the clean energy transition.

    Question. The United States has the energy resources needed to help 
our allies reduce their dependence on Russian energy. Our nation should 
be a strategic energy supplier to Europe. American natural gas is 
reliable, affordable, and abundant. It is an important energy solution 
for those who want to keep their lights on without empowering Russia. 
What are the current barriers to increasing exports of American energy 
resources to our allies in Europe?

    Answer. Energy exports to our European allies have increased 
significantly since January 2021. One current logistical barrier 
overseas is Europe's lack of sufficient compatible import 
infrastructure such as LNG import terminals or Floating Storage 
Regasification Units (FSRUs). We are working tirelessly with the 
private sector, and our partners and allies to address these capacity 
issues. Our European allies and partners already have taken steps to 
address existing infrastructure constraints to increase imports of non-
Russian gas.

    Question. The United States has the energy resources needed to help 
our allies reduce their dependence on Russian energy. Our nation should 
be a strategic energy supplier to Europe. American natural gas is 
reliable, affordable, and abundant. It is an important energy solution 
for those who want to keep their lights on without empowering Russia. 
What steps is the Administration currently taking to support U.S. 
energy companies in increasing domestic export capacity and building 
the infrastructure needed to increase exports to Europe?

    Answer. The Administration has already taken steps to increase U.S. 
LNG export capacity, including authorizing additional exports of LNG to 
non-free trade agreement countries from two existing facilities, one 
under construction and one additional approved LNG project. If 
confirmed, I commit to working with EU member states toward ensuring 
demand for approximately 50 billion cubic meters per year of additional 
U.S. supplies, until at least 2030, as part of the President's 
commitment to the U.S.-EU Task Force for Energy Security. In addition, 
I would ensure that ENR continues to support the work of the U.S. and 
the European Commission to expedite planning and approval for renewable 
energy projects that will facilitate exports of U.S. energy technology.

    Question. I believe improvements are needed to ensure the U.S. 
Government is pursuing a consistent and effective energy strategy 
around the world. For many years, there has been no clear delineation 
of responsibilities and authorities on international energy policy 
within the Executive branch. Duplication, redundancies, and conflicting 
lines of authorities have created serious problems in delivering a 
consistent message from the United States on international energy 
across the globe. Numerous government agencies remain tasked with 
pursing U.S. energy policies across the globe, including the U.S. 
Department of Energy, Department of Commerce, Department of Interior, 
Department of Treasury, the Energy Information Administration, and the 
National Security Council. As a result, areas of responsibility remain 
confusing. This in turn allows agencies to shift decision-making 
responsibility and divert accountability. How are the lines of 
authority and responsibilities delineated between the U.S. Department 
of State's Bureau of Energy Resources and the U.S. Department of 
Energy's Office of Policy and International Affairs?

    Answer. By statute, the Department of State exercises primary 
authority for the conduct of foreign policy relating to energy. 
According to the DOE Organization Act, the Department of Energy 
implements policies regarding international energy issues that have a 
direct impact on research, development, and conservation of energy in 
the United States. State and DOE coordinate and cooperate on 
implementing U.S. foreign energy policy to avoid duplication and ensure 
that efforts are in line with broader U.S. foreign policy goals. For 
example, within the U.S.-EU Energy Council, ENR leads on the energy 
security working group, while DOE leads on the energy policy and energy 
technology working groups. Similarly, DOE and State participate 
together at international organizations, such as the International 
Energy Agency.

responsibility and divert accountability. Please describe your current 
understanding of the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Energy 
Resources' role in interagency collaboration on international energy 
issue.

    Answer. My understanding is that the U.S. Department of State's 
Bureau of Energy Resources collaborates closely with other bureaus and 
offices within the Department of State, and with other U.S. Government 
agencies, in advancing American energy-related goals and interests. The 
Department of State exercises primary authority for the conduct of 
foreign policy relating to energy. The Bureau of Energy Resources uses 
diplomacy, advocacy, and technical assistance to contribute to the 
advancement of American energy-related foreign policy goals, leaning 
heavily on the unique access and impact of our Embassies overseas.

confusing. This in turn allows agencies to shift decision-making 
responsibility and divert accountability. What steps do you propose to 
eliminate overlapping and conflicting roles?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would propose continuing the Bureau's 
commitment to close cooperation and collaboration with other U.S. 
Government agencies to ensure our respective efforts are complementary 
and collectively advance American interests.

collaboration on international energy policy need to be improved?

    Answer. I believe that interagency collaboration on international 
energy policy benefits from regular discussions and interactions among 
the different U.S. Government agencies involved. If confirmed, I commit 
to actively and constructively contribute to the interagency policy 
deliberation and formulation process.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
            to Hon. Robert A. Wood by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. What is your understanding of morale throughout your 
post?

    Answer. It is my understanding that morale at the Mission is high 
in light of the Administration's robust recommitment to multilateral 
engagement and in spite of the corresponding workload, which at times 
can prove challenging.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale across all of Mission 
Geneva?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to supporting Ambassador Linda 
Thomas-Greenfield and her team in efforts to guide, encourage, and 
recognize the exceptional community of professionals working for the 
U.S. Mission to the U.N. That includes a focus on team building, 
treating every team member with respect, and ensuring appropriate work-
life balance.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at your post?

    Answer. It is my distinct impression that Ambassador Linda Thomas-
Greenfield has created just such a vision for the Mission, and if 
confirmed I will invest in that vision to continue the remarkable 
pattern of accomplishment she has established since assuming that role.

    Question. How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I consider myself an inclusive and collaborative colleague, 
mentor, and team leader. If confirmed, I will strive to create an 
environment where all members of my team feel valued for their 
contributions and supported in their personal goals. I believe my 
record at various management levels speaks to someone who values 
collaboration, diversity, and shared success.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. Under no circumstances is this acceptable.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your deputy?

    Answer. If confirmed as Alternate Representative, I will have the 
honor of supervising an exceptional team of Foreign and Civil Service 
employees, and intend to operate with transparency, trust, and respect.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your deputy?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will invest in the broad expertise of my 
team, entrusting them with the necessary autonomy to continue working 
with the success and confidence they demonstrate every day.

    Question. If confirmed, do you support U.N. Security Council reform 
including any potential efforts to expand the non-permanent or 
permanent members of the Council?

    Answer. The United States supports a U.N. Security Council that is 
effective and fit for the challenges of the 21st century. If confirmed, 
I would remain open to a modest expansion of both permanent and non-
permanent Security Council members in a way that does not diminish the 
Security Council's effectiveness or efficiency and does not alter or 
expand the veto.

    Question. Do you support the expansion of veto power?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would remain open to a modest expansion of 
both permanent and non-permanent Security Council members in a way that 
does not alter or expand the veto.

    Question. Do you believe Security Council reform is necessary? Why 
or why not?

    Answer. A well-executed expansion of the Security Council could 
help modernize the body to better reflect 21st century global realities 
and increase its effectiveness. If confirmed, I would work with our 
allies to support the evolution of this institution in a manner that 
promotes efficiency and effectiveness, without compromising United 
States interests.

    Question. What other efforts would you support?

    Answer. If confirmed, I am open to exploring other efforts that do 
not diminish the Security Council's effectiveness or efficiency and do 
not alter or expand the veto. In April, the United States cosponsored, 
along with 82 other countries, a U.N. General Assembly resolution that 
improves Security Council transparency--a sought-after reform--by 
automatically convening a debate in the General Assembly in response to 
the use of the veto in the Security Council.

    Question. What is your assessment of the U.S.'s role on the 
Security Council? Are we effectively using our voice and vote to 
influence positive change towards peace and security?

    Answer. The United States is committed to using the unique 
authority of the U.N. Security Council, as well as the U.N. system more 
broadly, to advance U.S. interests and respond to threats to 
international peace and security. If confirmed, I will be both a 
defender of and advocate for U.S. standards, values, and interests at 
the U.N. Security Council.

    Question. What is your assessment of Russia on the Security Council 
in light of their war on Ukraine?

    Answer. Russia's egregious actions are an affront to the core 
mandate of the Security Council and are especially outrageous given 
that it is a permanent member. If confirmed and if there were a path to 
suspend Russia from the U.N. Security Council, I would seek to pursue 
it immediately, particularly in light of its violations of the U.N. 
principles Russia has committed to defend. Russia's status as a 
permanent member of the Security Council, however, is enshrined in the 
U.N. Charter. To change this would require renegotiating and amending 
the Charter, which is a treaty among all the U.N.'s 193 Member States, 
including Russia. All amendments to the Charter require ratification of 
all five Permanent Members, including Russia, in order to enter into 
force.

    Question. The recent effort in the General Assembly to force a GA 
meeting upon the use of a veto was supported by the U.S. In your view, 
was this key to strengthening the council?

    Answer. This U.N. General Assembly resolution is a significant step 
toward the accountability, transparency, and responsibility of all 
Permanent Members of the Security Council who wield the veto. We see 
virtue in automatically convening a General Assembly meeting when a 
veto is cast, to give the Permanent Member of the U.N. Security Council 
the opportunity to explain its veto to the full General Assembly 
membership, and for the Members of the General Assembly to express 
their views.

    Question. What can be done to strengthen the U.S. position on the 
Security Council?

    Answer. If confirmed, I am committed to driving our multilateral 
engagement to deliver concrete outcomes to advance our values around 
the world. Within the Security Council, if confirmed, I will work 
closely with our P3 allies, France and the UK, as well as elected UNSC 
members to push back on China and Russia's obstructionism and 
alternative authoritarian agenda.

    Question. What is your view of the current state of U.N. 
peacekeeping?

    Answer. U.N. peacekeeping operations are among the most effective 
mechanisms of burden-sharing to address the global challenges to 
international peace and security. The United States continues to 
evaluate peacekeeping missions with a view to making them as efficient 
and effective as possible, while also providing missions with the 
necessary resources to fully implement their mandates. If confirmed, I 
will commit to working with the Administration in prioritizing reforms 
in annual budget negotiations, increasing the efficiency of missions 
and minimizing the cost to U.S. taxpayers, including reducing or 
closing missions where appropriate and when conditions allow.

    Question. Are there missions that are more challenging politically 
than others? If so, which ones?

    Answer. Peacekeeping missions facilitate post-conflict recovery by 
protecting civilians, preserving security, and creating the space for 
political solutions. While the U.N. Secretary-General and many Member 
States stress the importance of peacekeeping missions supporting 
political solutions, these are long-term endeavors that require 
persistence, political will, and significant resources. The most 
challenging missions are those where tremendous effort and many 
political processes over the years have not yielded a durable, 
sustainable peace. If confirmed, I will ensure that U.S. engagement 
continues to press for both short- and long-term solutions.

    Question. Do you believe any missions are no longer meeting their 
mandate? If so, what do you believe would be appropriate action by the 
Security Council?

    Answer. The administration continually reviews and assesses all 
existing peacekeeping missions to ensure they are making a meaningful 
and substantive contribution to international peace and security. If 
confirmed, for missions where that work remains imperative, I will 
focus on making them as effective and efficient as possible and 
providing them with the resources necessary to fully implement their 
mandates, including well-trained and well-equipped troops and police. 
If confirmed, for missions in countries where conditions allow, I will 
work with the U.N. Secretariat and U.N. Security Council to press for 
early strategic planning and sustainable transitions that preserve the 
advances in host nation peace and security.

    Question. Ongoing allegations and incidents of sexual exploitation 
and abuse by peacekeepers and U.N. personnel (and most recently an 
American) continue to draw international attention. What can the U.S., 
and the U.N., do to prevent more incidents of sexual abuse and assault?

    Answer. The Secretary-General has taken important steps to address 
SEA, many of which the United States has directly supported, but there 
is still work to be done. If confirmed, I am committed to working with 
the Secretary-General to hold peacekeepers accountable.
    In September 2021, the Secretary-General repatriated the entire 
Gabonese contingent deployed to the U.N. Multidimensional Integrated 
Stabilization Force in the CAR (MINUSCA) following repeated, credible 
allegations of SEA by Gabon's troops. This marked an important step 
forward in the implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2272 
(2016), drafted and championed by the United States, to provide the 
Secretary-General enhanced measures to deter future acts of SEA in 
peacekeeping and hold offenders accountable.
    The United States has also discontinued peacekeeping security 
assistance in the form of PKO-funded Global Peace Operations Initiative 
(GPOI) programming to three countries--Mauritania in 2019 and Cameroon 
and Gabon in 2020--when they failed to prevent and/or hold their 
peacekeepers accountable for persistent SEA and broader conduct and 
discipline issues.

    Question. Most recently, the Council has experienced internal 
conflict about holding meetings on particular humanitarian crises like 
Syria, Ukraine, Ethiopia, and more. What is your assessment of this 
issue? Should the Security Council hold more regular meetings on these 
topics? If no, please explain.

    Answer. The monthly program of work for the Security Council is 
negotiated among the members, with a significant number of the meetings 
fixed by directives in Security Council resolutions, including 
discussions on humanitarian situations. The Security Council has a 
monthly meeting on the humanitarian situation in Syria, and the Council 
has met 16 times on Ukraine since February 21, 2022, though some of 
these meetings on Ukraine were called by Russia on farcical pretenses. 
If confirmed, I commit to using these engagements as opportunities to 
work with like-minded partners to highlight humanitarian crises, 
including ones caused or exacerbated by Russia's further invasion of 
Ukraine.

    Question. Additionally, the Council has issues passing resolutions 
or making statements on these topics. Do you believe the U.N. Security 
council is broken? Why or why not?

    Answer. The Security Council reflects global political dynamics 
and, as such, is often a challenging venue. If confirmed, I commit to 
working with our partners to address international crises through 
political missions, sanctions and embargos, and peacekeeping 
operations, notwithstanding Russian and PRC obstructionism. The 
requirement, adopted in April 2022, that the General Assembly 
automatically convenes a meeting following a veto in the Security 
Council is a significant step toward ensuring the accountability, 
transparency, and responsibility of all Permanent Members of the 
Security Council in the appropriate use of the veto.

    Question. Russia and China have used their position on the Council 
to block formal meetings on topics they did not like, including human 
rights abuses in Xinjiang, Syria, and more. What is your assessment of 
this issue? How can the U.S. use its influence to highlight these 
important issues regardless of other P5 members?

    Answer. Under the Security Council's rules, one Council member 
cannot block formal meetings of the Council. If confirmed, I will 
commit to working closely with our partners to ensure the Security 
Council discusses all threats to international peace and security. 
Beyond the Security Council, the United States leads efforts to ensure 
critical issues are addressed in the U.N. system and in other fora, 
including the General Assembly, Human Rights Council, OPCW, and IAEA. 
In those settings, the United States highlights issues like Russia's 
and China's oppression of their own citizens, Syria's chemical weapons 
use, and Iran's nuclear program.

    Question. The most recent Security Council elections replaced 5 of 
the elected 10 members with each candidate running unopposed. Do you 
believe clean slates for U.N. bodies are beneficial? Why or why not?

    Answer. Being elected to the U.N. Security Council is arguably the 
most prestigious assignment for a country in the U.N. system. It is 
also a major commitment of resources and requires significant 
preparation. Countries typically announce their candidacy years, if not 
decades, in advance to adequately plan. Once a country announces its 
candidacy, regional blocs often discourage competition to ensure 
diversity of representation and to avoid wasted efforts. In the wider 
U.N. setting, clean slate elections can be detrimental to U.N. bodies, 
often allowing candidates who are unqualified for, or worse, hostile 
to, the work of those bodies. If confirmed, I will work to actively 
encourage qualified candidates to participate in U.N. elections.

    Question. There have been proposals put forward for U.N. 
peacekeeping budget to fund missions that have not been approved by the 
U.N. Security Council. Do you believe that the U.N. peacekeeping budget 
should only be put towards mission approved by the U.N. Security 
Council?

    Answer. The Biden administration would not support the use of U.N.-
assessed contributions to fund peacekeeping missions that have not been 
authorized by the U.N. Security Council (UNSC). U.N. Security Council 
oversight is one of the key preconditions of any agreement on the use 
of U.N.-assessed funds for non-U.N. peace support operations. If 
confirmed, I will work with the appropriate U.N. oversight bodies, 
including the UNSC through resolutions authorizing mission mandates, to 
oversee U.N. funds.

    Question. The United States is the single largest financial 
contributor to U.N. peacekeeping activities. Congress authorizes and 
appropriates U.S. contributions, and it has an ongoing interest in 
ensuring such funding is used as efficiently and effectively as 
possible. Do you believe that any nation, including the United States, 
should pay more than 25 percent of the U.N. peacekeeping budget?

    Answer. My firm belief is that the United States should pay its 
assessed contributions in full and on time, while concurrently working 
to reduce those contributions by maximizing efficiencies and 
encouraging other member states to assume more of the financial burden. 
In December 2021, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations achieved a 
reduction in the U.S. peacekeeping assessment rate from 27.9 to 26.9 
percent and preserved the 22 percent ceiling for the U.N. regular 
budget assessment. If confirmed, I will work with counterparts to 
ensure that peacekeeping missions are fit for purpose, focused on 
results, and accountable for their resources.

    Question. What is your position on U.S. repayment of U.N. 
peacekeeping arrears? As memorialized in the 1999 Helms-Biden 
agreement, the Late Ambassador Holbrooke, then-President Clinton, then-
Secretary General Kofi Anan, and then-Senator Biden all believed that 
the United States has no obligation to pay, and thus should not pay, 
the roughly $500 million in ``contested arrears'' that were explicitly 
excluded from the $1.6 billion Helms-Biden agreement. However, since 
then, the U.N. has insisted upon keeping on its books, and the Obama 
administration sought to pay over Congressional objections. Do you 
commit not to pay these ``contested arrears'' per Congressional intent 
as outlined in the Helms-Biden agreement?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would welcome the opportunity to work with 
Congress to determine how best to meet our financial obligations, 
including addressing the substantial level of arrears that have 
accumulated over the past five years and the 25-percent cap on 
peacekeeping funding.

    Question. Are there any specific steps you believe the U.N. should 
take to reduce the overall size of the U.N. peacekeeping budget? If so, 
what are they?

    Answer. If confirmed, I am committed to reviewing and assessing all 
existing peacekeeping missions to ensure they are still necessary for 
the promotion of international peace and security. For missions that 
remain necessary, I will work to ensure they are as effective and 
efficient as possible, while also ensuring they have the necessary 
resources to fully implement their mandates, including well-trained and 
well-equipped troops and police.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
          to Hon. Robert A. Wood by Senator Benjamin L. Cardin

    Question. What, in your opinion, are the prospects for effective 
Security Council action on the situation in Ukraine?

    Answer. The prospects for effective action within the Security 
Council itself on the situation in Ukraine are limited by Russia's veto 
power. However, we have seen effective action taken within other U.N. 
bodies, including the U.N. General Assembly, which overwhelmingly 
adopted three resolutions condemning Russia's full-scale invasion of 
Ukraine.
    In one of these votes in the General Assembly, member states 
suspended Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council (HRC). The HRC also 
adopted a resolution establishing a Commission of Inquiry into 
violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international 
humanitarian law. Secretary-General Guterres condemned Russia's 
violation of the U.N. Charter and offered his good offices to negotiate 
an end to the war, to facilitate humanitarian corridors, and to find a 
solution to Ukraine's inability to transport its agricultural 
commodities due to Russia's aggression.
    The U.N. provides significant lifesaving assistance to the people 
of Ukraine and refugees from Ukraine through U.N. agencies, and if 
confirmed, I will commit to working with these partners, such as 
UNICEF, UNHCR, IOM, the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP), the Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the WHO, to ensure these lines of 
effort remain a priority. The United States has provided $688 million 
dollars this year to fund this work.

    Question. In the absence of possibilities in the Security Council, 
what are other opportunities to utilize the U.N. system to assist the 
people and government of Ukraine?

    Answer. If confirmed, I am committed to supporting Ukraine and 
holding Russian President Vladimir Putin and his government to account 
across international fora--including the United Nations--in 
coordination with Ukraine, allies and partners, humanitarian 
organizations, and other international organizations. I will support 
steps the United Nations has already taken to hold Russia to account 
such as the U.N. Human Rights Council's Commission of Inquiry (UNHRC 
CoI) and the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mechanism in Ukraine 
(UNHRMMU). I will continue to encourage other governments to support 
and increase their support to Ukraine's Humanitarian Response Plan, 
which is coordinated by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) and covers critical needs for the 
millions of people displaced within, or outside of, Ukraine by Russia's 
aggression.

    Question. If confirmed, how would you utilize your position to 
improve the effectiveness of economic sanctions?

    Answer. The key to making U.N. economic sanctions effective is in 
promoting their full implementation by all U.N. Member States. When the 
U.N. Security Council adopts economic sanctions measures under Chapter 
VII of the U.N. Charter, all U.N. Member States are required under 
international law to implement them. If confirmed, I will work 
diligently to ensure effective implementation of these measures, 
including by publicly calling out any U.N. Member State that knowingly 
violates them. We will continue working to strengthen implementation, 
helping bolster countries' capacity to implement and enforce sanctions 
and work with the U.N. system, including the U.N. sanctions expert 
panels and Security Council sanctions committees, to call attention to 
potential sanctions violations, remind U.N. Member States of their 
obligations under U.N. Security Council sanctions resolutions, and 
reiterate the importance to international peace and security of full 
compliance with the U.N. Security Council's decisions. We share 
information with those same U.N. sanctions expert panels to enhance 
their investigations and offer robust capacity-building assistance to 
U.N. Member States on a wide range of relevant issues, including 
banking, maritime trade, and others. Where appropriate, we work with 
our partners on the U.N. Security Council to nominate individuals and 
entities for designation in relevant U.N. sanctions committees and may 
consider implementing sanctions under domestic authorities on such 
individuals and entities when not designated by the U.N.

    Question. In your view, how effective have U.N Security Council 
economic sanctions been to date?

    Answer. U.N. Security Council-imposed economic sanctions have a 
mixed record in achieving their goals. Effectiveness has depended on 
many factors, including the degree to which U.N. Member States have 
faced consequences for failing to fully implement legally binding 
sanctions measures, as is required under the U.N. Charter. The most 
expansive U.N. Security Council economic sanctions now in existence are 
those imposed on the DPRK for the development of its nuclear and 
ballistic missile programs. These measures have severely impeded the 
Kim regime's ability to import foreign technologies, equipment, and 
other materials for its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs. If 
confirmed, I will continue to prioritize strengthening sanctions on the 
DPRK and working towards their full implementation. In response to 
concerns about Iran's nuclear program, the Security Council adopted 
multiple rounds of sanctions from 2006-2010 that helped get Iran to 
consent to limits in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action 
(JCPOA). Targeted U.N. counterterrorism sanctions have made it much 
harder for groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda to raise, transfer or conceal 
funds. The United States is working hard to make sure that U.N. 
Security Council-imposed sanctions have clear objectives, are well 
integrated with broader diplomatic strategies, and are dynamic and 
flexible in response to relevant events. If confirmed, I will look to 
ensure U.N. Security Council sanctions continue to be used as a strong 
tool to counter threats to U.S. national security and global stability.

             to Hon. Robert A. Wood by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. Although the U.N. is often thought of as the guardian of 
world peace, it is in reality a dysfunctional, bureaucratic institution 
that gives our adversaries, such as the Chinese Communist Party, a 
forum to further their malign influence. How would you counter 
Beijing's efforts to abuse the U.N. Security Council to further its 
agenda?

    Answer. As I have in other multilateral fora, if confirmed I will 
continue to call out the PRC for its malign behavior and actions. I 
will also work with likeminded partners to promote the integrity of the 
U.N. system based on the principles and values of the U.N. Charter. If 
confirmed, I will work in the U.N. Security Council to present a united 
front against those who seek to advance authoritarian and destabilizing 
agendas. This type of outreach and coordination sends a powerful 
message throughout the multilateral system--as it did during the 
several historic votes in the U.N. General Assembly condemning Russia's 
unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine. The U.N. General 
Assembly held a debate on June 8 and 10 following vetoes by China and 
Russia of a U.S.-drafted Security Council resolution that would have 
imposed further sanctions on the DPRK for its unlawful ballistic 
missile launches. The many U.N. member states that spoke during this 
debate calling for U.N. Security Council action underscored the 
isolation of China and Russia on this issue. If confirmed, I will work 
to widen and deepen that isolation.

    Question. What steps can the U.S. take to further its influence in 
the U.N. and minimize that of the Chinese Communist Party?

    Answer. The United States is implementing a comprehensive 
multilateral strategy, alongside other regional plans, to counter the 
harmful influence of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and 
strengthen the U.N. and rules-based international order. This strategy 
includes advancing an affirmative agenda that highlights the role and 
contributions of the United States in addressing global challenges; 
advocating against any kind of U.N. endorsement of any country's 
signature foreign policy platforms, such as the Belt and Road 
Initiative; supporting qualified candidates for elected and appointed 
positions in the U.N. and other international organizations who will 
act independently; and developing flexible coalitions with a diverse 
array of countries to strengthen the rules-based international system. 
If confirmed, I would champion our efforts aimed to create an 
environment resistant to the PRC's efforts to bend international 
organizations to their worldview.

    Question. China has roughly 1,072 peacekeeping personnel deployed 
in South Sudan and the China National Petroleum Corporation controls a 
40 percent stake--the largest of any stakeholder--in a consortium that 
extracts South Sudan's oil. In 2012, the Chinese Government dispatched 
its first combat unit to the continent to support the U.N. Mission in 
South Sudan (UNMISS). After civil war broke out in the country in 2013, 
Beijing played a significant role in increasing the UNMISS authorized 
troop strength and modifying UNMISS's mandate to include a broader 
interpretation of the U.N.'s nonintervention policy. In this expanded 
mandate, Beijing successfully lobbied for a provision to include the 
protection of workers on oil installations.
    Although the provision initially encountered resistance from 
officials in the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations, who argued 
the change would undermine the U.N.'s neutrality and place peacekeepers 
on the side of the South Sudanese Government and the oil industry, the 
mandate expansion was ultimately adopted unanimously by the U.N. 
Security Council in 2014. The new mandate aligned peacekeepers with the 
South Sudanese Government and the country's oil sector, and by 
extension, Beijing's economic interests.

   What is your assessment of this case?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would ensure constant vigilance in our 
review of UNSC products to guard against PRC and other states 
exploiting multilateral fora to pursue parochial interests or national 
agendas.

    Question. Clearly this was done against U.S. interests. How will 
you prevent Beijing from coopting the U.N. Security Council and U.N. 
Peacekeeping system to further its own interests and diminish our own 
in the future?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will coordinate closely with State 
Department colleagues, other members of the Security Council, and U.N. 
partners in New York and in the field to ensure that we advance U.S. 
priorities across U.N. peacekeeping, including, for instance, by 
preventing changes to Security Council mandates that seek to undermine 
those priorities. More broadly, I will seek common ground at the 
Security Council with those who take their responsibilities seriously 
among the permanent and elected members to highlight our shared values 
and present a united front against those who seek to advance 
authoritarian and destabilizing agendas.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
             to Hon. Robert A. Wood by Senator Rob Portman

    Question. The United Nation's bias against Israel is long-standing 
and well-known.

   If confirmed, what will you do to fight back against the U.N.'s 
        bias against Israel?

    Answer. I agree completely that U.N. bias against Israel is long-
standing and well-known. In previous leadership positions at the U.S. 
Mission to the U.N. in Vienna and at the Conference on Disarmament, I 
worked closely with Israeli officials in lobbying member states to 
oppose regular Arab League resolutions at the International Atomic 
Energy Agency condemning Israel for not joining the Nuclear Non-
proliferation Treaty. If confirmed, I will continue the United States' 
work in opposing efforts to unfairly single out or delegitimize Israel 
through one-sided resolutions, reports, and other actions across the 
United Nations, including the Security Council, the General Assembly, 
the Human Rights Council, and other bodies. If confirmed, I will also 
work with our Israeli diplomatic colleagues to promote the election of 
Israeli citizens to U.N. leadership posts and Israel's inclusion in 
U.N. working groups, as well as support qualified Israeli candidates 
for appointments within the U.N. system.

    Question. On February 24th, the day of Russia's invasion of 
Ukraine, I said that the U.S. should work with our allies and partners 
to remove Russia from the Security Council. Their flagrant disregard 
for the principles of the U.N. Charter, their abuse of their veto power 
to worsen Syria's humanitarian situation, and other their unprovoked 
violence against U.N. member states make them unfit to serve on the 
Security Council.

    What are your thoughts on this?

   Do you believe that Russia deserves a seat on the U.N. Security 
        Council?

   If yes, why do they deserve that honor?

   Are there any issues that you believe we can work with the Russians 
        on in good faith?

    Answer. Russia's egregious violations are an affront to the core 
mandate of the U.N. Security Council, and it is outrageous that a 
permanent member has acted in this manner, particularly in light of its 
violations of the U.N. principles it had committed to defend. A change 
in Russia's status as a permanent member of the UNSC, however, would 
require renegotiating and amending the U.N. Charter, which is a treaty 
among all 193 member states of the U.N., including Russia. All 
amendments to the Charter require ratification by all five Permanent 
Members, including Russia, in order to enter into force. Given these 
realities, if confirmed, my focus will be to continue working with 
likeminded partners across the U.N. system to further isolate Russia 
and impose additional consequences for its egregious violations of 
international law.
    The nature of the U.N. Security Council working procedures requires 
we engage with Russia, as all other members of the Security Council, if 
it is in the United States' interest to do so. If confirmed, I pledge 
to be realistic and clear-eyed about the limits of our engagement with 
Russia given its violations of the U.N. Charter.

                                                    Washington, DC.
    The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:00 a.m., in 
Room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Brian Schatz 
presiding.
    Present: Senators Schatz [presiding], Cardin, Coons,

Hagerty.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN SCHATZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII

    Senator Schatz. Good morning. The Senator Foreign Relations 
Committee will come to order. We are here today to consider 
several important nominations: Mr. Dean Thompson to be 
Ambassador to Nepal, Mr. Robert Godec to be the Ambassador to 
Thailand, Mr. Yohannes Abraham to be the Ambassador to the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Mr. Richard Buangan to 
be the Ambassador to Mongolia, and Marie C. Damour, to be the 
Ambassador to the Republics of Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, the 
Kingdom of Tonga, and Tuvalu.
    Senator Van Hollen is here to introduce Mr. Thompson, so I 
will now turn it over to him to make his introduction.

              STATEMENT OF HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MARYLAND

    Senator Van Hollen. Well thank you, Mr. Chairman and 
Ranking Member Romney. Let me start by congratulating all of 
the nominees here today and thank you for your service.
    I have the special privilege, Mr. Chairman, of introducing 
President Biden's nominee to serve as our next United States 
Ambassador to Nepal, Mr. Dean R. Thompson. President Biden 
selected a nominee with impeccable credentials, sterling 
character, and a deep knowledge of U.S. diplomacy, and he has 
also wisely selected a Marylander who holds a master's degree 
from the University of Maryland and represents the very best of 
our state.
    As a career member of the Foreign Service, Dean Thompson 
has served overseas in Malaysia, Romania, India, Paraguay, 
Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Here at home he served in several 
leadership roles within the State Department, including poses 
as the Director of the State Department's Executive Secretariat 
staff, Deputy Director of the State Department Operations 
Center, and Director of the Operations Center Crisis Management 
staff. He currently serves as the Principal Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs and stepped up to 
serve as Acting Assistant Secretary from 2020 to 2021.
    I believe each of these experiences, which span over 25 
years of service to our nation, have provided Mr. Thompson with 
a deep knowledge of U.S. foreign policy and how to connect 
effectively with local communities in Nepal, should this 
committee confirm his nomination.
    Beyond this extraordinary resume, Dean Thompson is a man of 
exemplary character. He is regarded within the State Department 
as someone who not only possesses the strength to lead but also 
has the heart to fully invest in the well-being and success of 
those who work for him. He is composed and kind and equal 
measure, always committed to getting the job done with 
efficiency, respect, and decency.
    He is supported in all these things by his family, and I 
want to salute his wife, Jane, and his mother, Linda, who are 
with us in the hearing room today. Thank you very much for 
being here. And I want to give a shout-out to his father, his 
children, and his new grandson, all of whom are watching 
online.
    I grew up in a Foreign Service family. I lived in some of 
the countries where Dean Thompson has served, and I know the 
challenges and the opportunities of having a parent represent 
our nation overseas. I want to commend Dean Thompson, the 
Thompson family, and the Foreign Service Officers and families, 
families of Foreign Service Officers in this room, and all 
around the world. They are on the front lines of advancing 
America's priorities abroad, and those of us in the United 
States Congress must commit ourselves every day to honor their 
service and their sacrifice through our work here in the 
Capitol.
    Also growing up in a Foreign Service family taught me how 
to spot a good diplomat. I know a good one when I see one, and 
Dean Thompson is truly a diplomat in every sense of the world. 
He will be ready to go on day one, and colleagues, I urge this 
committee to support his nomination. Thank you.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen. 
Congratulations to all of you. You are all qualified for these 
positions, and we thank you for being willing to serve at this 
challenging time. We also especially thank your families, and 
when you have an opportunity to address the committee we would 
welcome your introduction of your family.
    If confirmed, Mr. Thompson would serve during an important 
time in U.S.-Nepalese relations. Nepal is one of the few 
countries in the region to condemn Russia's invasion of 
Ukraine. Earlier this year, the Nepalese Parliament approved a 
$500 million in infrastructure grant from the Millennium 
Challenge Corporation, a decision met with protests from 
citizens who were concerned about American influence in their 
country, and just last month the Nepalese government cancelled 
its participation in the U.S. State Partnership Program. These 
actions followed a concerted Chinese government disinformation 
campaign. It is vital that the U.S. Ambassador to Nepal be able 
to navigate this landscape and reassure the people of Nepal 
that America is their ally. Mr. Thompson's depth of experience 
in this region makes him well-qualified to take on this 
important post.
    Robert Godec is a career diplomat who most recently served 
as Acting Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of African Affairs 
at the Department of State. He served as U.S. Ambassador to 
Kenya from 2013 to 2019, and U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia from 
2006 to 2009. During his long career he has also held positions 
as the Assistant Office Director for Thailand and Burma in the 
Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs and Director for 
Southeast Asian Affairs at the Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative.
    Thailand is a major non-NATO ally with the largest economy 
in mainland Southeast Asia. Secretary Blinken was in Bangkok 
this past week and signed two cooperation agreements with his 
Thai counterpart to deepen ties between our two nations, 
saying, ``We are taking the partnership between us fully into 
the 21st century.''
    Thailand is also a member of the Indo-Pacific Economic 
Forum and a key partner in a free and open Indo-Pacific. Mr. 
Godec's wide breadth of experience, which includes previous 
work on Thailand and regional trade issues make him an 
excellent nominee for this position at this critical time.
    Yohannes Abraham currently serves as Deputy Assistant to 
the President, Chief of Staff, and Executive Secretary of the 
National Security Council. He has worked in the Executive 
branch in various capacities, including as a Senior Advisor to 
the National Economic Council and a Deputy Assistant to the 
President for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Engagement 
during the Obama administration.
    In his current position, Mr. Abraham has cultivated 
valuable experience helping plan and execute the 2021 and 2022 
U.S.-ASEAN Summits, the President's first trip to Asia, and the 
Vice President's trip to Vietnam and Singapore. The United 
States must continue to engage with ASEAN on issues of 
international significance, including climate change and 
infrastructure development, and Mr. Abraham is well-suited to 
take on this task.
    Richard Buangan is a career member of the Senior Foreign 
Service, Class of Minister-Counselor. He most recently served 
as Acting Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Global Public 
Affairs at the State Department and prior to that he served as 
Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of East Asia and 
Pacific Affairs. Mr. Buangan also lived in my home state of 
Hawaii for part of his childhood, when his dad was in the Navy, 
and I understand that his dad is here today. Congratulations. I 
am sure you are very proud.
    Mongolia is a vast nation surrounded by Russia and China 
and a young democracy. It is more important than ever that the 
United States continue its friendship with the Mongolian people 
and find opportunities to collaborate on issues, including 
energy independence and economic development, and Mr. Buangan 
is well-qualified to do so.
    Marie Damour is a career member of the Senior Foreign 
Service who has served as Council General in Ho Chi Minh City, 
Vietnam, since 2019. She previously served as Director in the 
Office of Maritime Southeast Asia in the Bureau of East Asian 
and Pacific Affairs as well as in the Office of Policy 
Coordination and Public Affairs in the Bureau of Consular 
Affairs. She was also the Deputy Chief of Mission as well as 
the Charge d'Affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Wellington, New 
Zealand.
    Ms. Damour has been nominated to represent our nation in 
five Pacific Island countries: Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Tonga, 
and Tuvalu, that cover thousands of square miles of ocean. 
These nations are important partners, and the United States 
must genuinely engage with them on issues that are of concern 
to the region, from IUU fishing to sea level rise threatening 
their very existence.
    I have spoken with ambassadors from many of the countries 
that Ms. Damour will be working with, if confirmed, and there 
are urgent needs in these communities that the United States 
has unfortunately neglected for too long. I am encouraged by 
the commitments Vice President Harris made at the Pacific 
Island Forum leaders' meeting yesterday, including plans to 
establish U.S. embassies in Kiribati and Tonga, appoint an 
envoy to the Pacific Island Forums, bring the Peace Corps back 
to the Pacific, and make progress towards re-establishing a 
USAID regional mission for the Pacific in Suva. I am sure you 
will be directly involved in many of these efforts, and if 
confirmed, I look forward to speaking with you more about how 
the United States can expand its engagement in the region.
    There are few jobs as important as confirming nominees to 
be U.S. Ambassador. It is my honor to chair this hearing, 
especially given that all five of these nominees, if confirmed, 
will represent the United States in the Indo-Pacific, a region 
critical to our foreign policy and national security. These 
positions require vast skills and experience, and you all have 
it.
    I now yield to the Ranking Member, Senator Romney.

                STATEMENT OF HON. MITT ROMNEY, 
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM UTAH

    Senator Romney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your comments, 
and thank you to each of the nominees for your willingness to 
again take on the mantle of service for our nation in a region 
of the world which is critical for the citizens there but also 
critical for the interest of the United States, given the 
dynamic of authoritarian promotion by the Communist Chinese 
Party as well as a recognition that this is a critical time in 
history as it relates to major global issues.
    I appreciate your willingness to serve our country and to 
represent our interests. Our friends and allies are important 
in Asia, one because we value friendship and we value the 
relations we have with these nations, but also because of our 
strategic objectives in the region, and that is only going to 
become more necessary as China continues down its path of 
malign behavior.
    Mr. Chairman, rather than reading through my opening 
comments I would ask that they be included in the record so 
that we can hear from the nominees and move directly to 
questions.
    Senator Schatz. Without objection. Thank you, Senator 
Romney.
    [The prepared statement of Senator Romney follows:]


               Prepared Statement of Senator Mitt Romney

    Thank you to our nominees for being here today and for your 
commitment to serve our country and represent our nation's interest 
abroad as ambassadors. Our friends and allies in Asia are not just 
important, but necessary for meeting U.S. strategic objectives around 
the world, and will only become more necessary if China continues down 
its path of malign behavior.
    China's quest to become the world's leading power-economically, 
militarily, and geopolitically-is the central challenge of the 21st 
Century. We must link arms with our friends and allies to confront 
China, to push the Chinese Communist Party to abandon its predatory 
policies, and demand that China abide by international norms and rules. 
We must also the cause of freedom around the world-including holding 
the CCP accountable for the atrocities they commit against the Uyghur 
people and other ethnic minorities.
    Southeast Asia is a vibrant region of growing strategic important 
to the future of a free and open Indo-Pacific. ASEAN nations are 
feeling pressure from China given its close proximity and influence-
especially as China continues to make investments in energy, critical 
minerals, and other areas. Expanding concrete economic engagement in 
the region is what our partners most want to see, and it's crucial for 
the U.S. economy as well. Mr. Abraham, I look forward to hearing from 
you how, if confirmed, you will work to find ways to leverage that 
existing strength and partnership in the region so that we can grow 
them further. A persistent advocate for tangible ways to expand this 
economic engagement is critical in this role.
    Thailand is a significant treaty ally within ASEAN-and a critical 
partner in the areas of energy and infrastructure. Mr. Godec, I hope to 
hear from you how, if confirmed as Ambassador to Thailand, you will 
work to not only support our close military relationship with the 
Thais, but prioritize ensuring the country remains a willing partner on 
providing opportunities for cross-border humanitarian assistance into 
Burma.
    I'm proud that the Utah Guard was able to deliver life-saving COVID 
supplies and equipment to Nepal last summer. I also applaud the 
decision by the Federal Parliament of Nepal to ratify its Millennium 
Challenge Corporation compact. Mr. Thompson, if confirmed, one of your 
crucial tasks as our next Ambassador will be overseeing its 
implementation, and we have to get this right.
    Mr. Buangan, as you are aware, Mongolia, a growing democracy and 
great partner to the U.S., is unfortunately wedged between two 
increasingly aggressive authoritarian powers: Russia and China. We must 
ensure that the U.S. remains active in the country and consider ways to 
expand our economic, development, and defense relationship. I'd like to 
hear from you on how, if confirmed as Ambassador to Mongolia, you will 
work to increase U.S.-Mongolia trade, and its trade with other 
countries, to reduce economic dependence on China and Russia.
    The United States is a longstanding partner of the Pacific Islands, 
and given China's encroachment, it is imperative that we solidify and 
amplify U.S. presence in the region. Notably, Fiji recently helped the 
U.S. seize the yacht of a Russian oligarch. The next U.S. Ambassador to 
Fiji needs to come to the table with concrete ideas for strengthening 
our ties in area such as health, education, investment, defense, and 
the environment. Ms. Damour, I would like to hear from you how, if 
confirmed, you would work to build collaboration with allies and 
partners, including Taiwan.
    I look forward to hearing from you all on the issues I outlined, 
and should you be confirmed, I urge you all to use your roles to 
promote the values of freedom and democracy abroad and work to dissuade 
China from pursuing its predatory path.
    Thank you, and I will now turn it back to Senator Schatz.


    Senator Schatz. We will now proceed to testimony and we 
will start with Mr. Godec.

STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT F. GODEC, OF VIRGINIA, A CAREER MEMBER 
   OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF CAREER MINISTER, 
NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF 
    THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND

    Mr. Godec. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the 
committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you 
as President Biden's nominee to be the next U.S. Ambassador to 
the Kingdom of Thailand. I want to thank President Biden and 
Secretary Blinken for their confidence in me. If confirmed, I 
look forward to working with Congress to advance U.S. interests 
in Thailand and the Indo-Pacific region.
    I would like to introduce to you my wife, Lori Magnusson, 
who is here today. Lori has been a source of inspiration, 
strength, and wisdom through our years together. Lori's 
constant love, support, and partnership have been 
extraordinary, and I owe much to her. Next to Lori is Brittany 
Jones, who is an exceptional caregiver and provides much 
support to Lori. I would also like to express my profound 
thanks to my mother, Nancy Dietrich, for all she has done for 
me. She is watching online this morning.
    Thailand has a rich history, remarkable culture, 
extraordinary beauty, and exceptional people. It has been a 
partner for the United States since 1833. Together, we have 
woven a rich tapestry of ties that are government-to-
government, business-to-business, university-to-university, 
NGO-to-NGO, and people-to-people. We have improved security in 
the region, faced global public health challenges, deepened 
mutual prosperity, and advanced the fight against human, 
wildlife, and drug trafficking. Building on our shared values 
and our just-signed United States-Thailand Communique on 
Strategic Alliance and Partnership, we have opportunities in 
the days ahead to strengthen further our partnership, to renew 
it, and take it to a new level.
    The United States and Thailand have a longstanding 
commitment to mutual security. Our militaries fought side by 
side in Korea and Vietnam. Today, Thailand is a treaty and 
major non-NATO ally, and we have many military engagements and 
training exercises, including COBRA Gold, the largest in Asia. 
Our alliance helps to ensure security for Thailand, the United 
States, and the region. If confirmed, I will seek to deepen it.
    Our economic partnership is another vital part of our 
tapestry of ties. Our total trade is over $60 billion a year 
and growing. U.S. businesses are a major investor in Thailand, 
and Thai companies are increasingly active in the United 
States. If confirmed, I will work to expand further our 
commercial ties.
    Strengthening democracy and promoting respect for human 
rights and the rule of law are fundamental to U.S. relations 
with Thailand. We have long supported multi-party democracy, 
freedom of expression, good governance, and respect for human 
rights across the world and in Thailand. We recognized that a 
democratically elected government took office in 2019 after the 
2014 coup, but work remains to be done by Thailand. If 
confirmed, I will vigorously continue our efforts to advance 
democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and will support 
civil society, independent media, and human rights defenders 
who play a critical role in this effort.
    The United States and Thailand also enjoy robust people-to-
people ties. Our connections are enriched by the presence in 
the United States of almost 350,000 Thais and U.S. citizens of 
Thai heritage, and by the more than 100,000 U.S. citizens in 
Thailand. We are strengthened by the close ties our 
universities and colleges enjoy as well as the cultural 
exchange programs we support in Thailand. If confirmed, I will 
work to increase opportunities for Thais and Americans to learn 
together and from each other.
    Thailand plays a vital role in the region. Today we work 
closely with Thailand in ASEAN, and in other regional 
mechanisms including the Mekong-U.S. Partnership. As a key 
ally, we welcome Thailand's decision to join the discussions on 
the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which will help build an 
economic partnership for the future. If confirmed, I will 
engage robustly with Thailand, the host of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation Forum this year, to facilitate the 
transition into our own 2023 host year.
    Across the years, we have cooperated with Thailand on 
regional challenges, including law enforcement, the response to 
natural disasters, and humanitarian relief. We welcome 
Thailand's commitment to address the threat of climate change; 
this will be a critical area for further collaboration. We 
appreciate Thailand's willingness to host refugees and, if 
confirmed, I would seek to ensure refugees and asylum seekers 
have all the support they need. And I would engage in Thailand 
to underscore our call to all countries to condemn the military 
coup in Burma and end the Burmese military's horrific violence, 
which has led to worsening human rights and humanitarian 
crises.
    Finally, our Embassy in Bangkok and Consulate General in 
Chiang Mai have exceptional teams that are doing extraordinary 
work to advance our partnership. Ensuring they are safe and 
secure, and have the resources they need, will be a top 
priority for me, if confirmed.
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the committee, 
if confirmed, I would welcome the opportunity to serve as the 
next U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of Thailand and to lead our 
team of capable and committed public servants to advance the 
U.S.-Thai partnership.
    I look forward to answering your questions. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Godec follows:]

increasingly active in the United States. If confirmed, I will work to 
expand further our commercial ties.
    Strengthening democracy and promoting respect for human rights and 
the rule of law are fundamental to U.S. relations with Thailand. We 
have long supported multi-party democracy, freedom of expression, good 
governance, and respect for human rights across the world and in 
Thailand. We recognized that a democratically elected government took 
office in 2019 after the 2014 coup, but work remains to be done by 
Thailand. If confirmed, I will vigorously continue our efforts to 
advance democracy, human rights, and the rule of law and will support 
civil society, independent media, and human rights defenders who play a 
critical role in this effort.
    We also enjoy robust people-to-people ties. Our connections are 
enriched by the presence in the United States of almost 350,000 Thais 
and U.S. citizens of Thai heritage, and by the more than100,000 U.S. 
citizens in Thailand. We are strengthened by the close ties our 
universities and colleges enjoy as well as the cultural exchange 
programs we support in Thailand. If confirmed, I will work to increase 
opportunities for Thais and Americans to learn together and from each 
other.
    Thailand plays a vital role in the region. Today, we work closely 
with Thailand in ASEAN, and in other regional mechanisms including the 
Mekong-U.S. Partnership. As a key ally, we welcome Thailand's decision 
to join the discussions on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which 
will help build an economic partnership for the future. If confirmed, I 
will engage robustly with Thailand, the host of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation forum this year, to facilitate the transition into 
our own 2023 host year.
    Across the years, we have cooperated with Thailand on regional 
challenges, including law enforcement, the response to natural 
disasters, and humanitarian relief. We welcome Thailand's commitment to 
address the threat of climate change; this will be a critical area for 
further collaboration. We appreciate Thailand's willingness to host 
refugees and, if confirmed, I would seek to ensure refugees and asylum 
seekers have all the support they need. And I would engage in Thailand 
to underscore our call to all countries to condemn the military coup in 
Burma and end the Burmese military's horrific violence, which has led 
to worsening human rights and humanitarian crises.
    Finally, our Embassy in Bangkok and Consulate General in Chiang Mai 
have exceptional teams that are doing extraordinary work to advance our 
partnership. Ensuring they are safe and secure, and have the resources 
they need, will be a top priority for me if confirmed.
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the committee, if 
confirmed, I would welcome the opportunity to serve as the next U.S. 
Ambassador to the Kingdom of Thailand and to lead our team of capable 
and committed public servants to advance the U.S.-Thai partnership.
    I look forward to answering your questions. Thank you.


    Senator Schatz. Thank you very much. Mr. Thompson, please 
proceed with your testimony.

STATEMENT OF DEAN R. THOMPSON, OF MARYLAND, A CAREER MEMBER OF 
   THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-COUNSELOR, 
NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF 
             THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO NEPAL

    Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Chairman Schatz, Ranking Member 
Romney, and honorable members of this committee. I appreciate 
very much you considering my nomination to serve as the next 
U.S. Ambassador to Nepal. I want to thank Senator Van Hollen 
for his far-too-generous remarks. My mother and my wife have 
joined me today. He introduced them. With my mother here, 
someone maybe believed part of his remarks even. We will see.
    I want to start by thanking my family, my wife, Jane, and 
my three children Marshall, Kendall, and Grace. They served 
with me for more than 26 years in the Foreign Service. They 
have endured frequent moves, emergency evacuations, and periods 
of separation. But they have also shared with me the privilege 
of serving the American people overseas, a privilege for which 
we are deeply grateful.
    I would also like to thank my parents--my mother is here--
for instilling in me a strong sense and interest in service and 
international relations. My father was the Director of 
International Programs at the National 4-H Council in 
Washington for 20 years, and prior to that Director for West 
Africa at the outset of Peace Corps.
    From my time as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the 
South and Central Asian Affairs Bureau, as a diplomat in 
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India, and a leader in the 
Department's crisis management apparatus, I do feel well-
prepared to serve in this capacity, if confirmed.
    It has been a privilege to serve the American people and, 
if confirmed, I welcome the opportunity to take on this 
important responsibility. If confirmed, I will embrace the 
opportunity to lead a topflight group of American and local 
staff and strive to create an environment that emphasizes the 
American values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
accessibility.
    We are at an important juncture in our relationship with 
Nepal. Nepal has been referred to as a ``yam between two 
stones,'' those stones, of course, being India and China. While 
those countries do have important relationships with Nepal, we 
also share Nepal's interest in strengthening its sovereignty 
and partnership with the United States.
    If confirmed, facilitating Nepal's economic growth and 
strengthening the trade ties between our countries will be key 
priorities. The United States' relationship with Nepal has seen 
recent gains that cement our 75-year partnership. Mr. Chairman, 
you mentioned Nepal's parliament ratified the $500 million 
Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact in the face of a 
torrid PRC disinformation campaign. This project will build 
electricity transmission lines to connect to Nepal's clean 
energy, abundant hydropower with South Asia's energy grid. It 
will also build high-quality roads in Nepal. These projects 
will increase the prosperity of both of our countries.
    USAID just signed a $659 million agreement with Nepal to 
contribute to Nepal's development over the next 5 years. This 
is a new chapter in the United States government's longstanding 
development relationship and reflects the evolution of our 
partnership. Post-earthquake reconstruction is winding down, 
the transition to federalism is well underway, and through 
successful programming the United States has helped lay the 
foundations to support Nepal's goal of graduating to middle-
income country status.
    If confirmed, I will also push for the rights of all Nepali 
citizens and residents. This includes the Dalits, marginalized 
communities, and refugee communities, including Tibetan 
refugees. I will encourage the government of Nepal to implement 
policies that promote meaningful inclusion, economic 
opportunity, and humanitarian support.
    Nepal's progress on the commitments it made during 
President Biden's Summit for Democracy demonstrates how 
important Nepal's young democracy is to its people and the 
importance it places on its relationship to the United States. 
Nepal's support for Ukraine resolutions at the U.N. General 
Assembly and the U.N. Human Rights Council demonstrates its 
dedication to the international rules-based order and the 
premise of territorial integrity. Nepal is a committed 
bilateral partner and a committed partner on the world stage.
    Finally, if confirmed, I will also work to help Nepal 
strengthen its democratic institutions. Nepal has come a long 
way since its civil war only 16 years ago. Like other 
democracies, Nepal's politics can be contentious and messy at 
times, but supporting Nepal's democracy is in our interest and 
will remain a priority of mine if confirmed as Ambassador.
    Mr. Chairman, I would like to close by saying that we have 
an important opportunity to strengthen the U.S. relationship 
with Nepal. I look forward to working with Congress to build 
this relationship.
    Thank you.

    Senator Schatz. Thank you very much. Mr. Abraham, please

  STATEMENT OF YOHANNES ABRAHAM, OF VIRGINIA, NOMINATED TO BE 
     REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE 
   ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS, WITH THE RANK AND 
     STATUS OF AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY

    Mr. Abraham. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and 
distinguished members of the committee, I am honored to be here 
today. I am grateful to President Biden and Secretary Blinken 
for placing their confidence in me to serve as the U.S. 
Representative to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, 
and I want to thank the members of this committee for your 
consideration of my nomination.
    I also want to thank the most important people in my life, 
my family. Our story is a familiar one, and it is one that is 
only possible in this greatest of nations. This country 
welcomed my parents with open arms when the country of their 
birth was being torn apart by the cruel ravages of a dictator. 
With no money and no connections, but with faith and 
determination, they worked all manner of jobs to put themselves 
through college and graduate school. They went on to become 
successful professionals and small-business owners, as well as 
active members of our community of Springfield, Virginia. They 
raised my sister and me to love this country that had given 
them so much. They are the two most incredible people I have 
ever known, and they are the reason I am sitting here today, 
and I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to thank 
my parents.
    The United States is a great nation. We are also a Pacific 
power, with deep roots and critical interests in the region. If 
confirmed, I look forward to working closely with Congress to 
realize our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, one 
where countries and individuals are able to make independent 
decisions free from coercion.
    Southeast Asia's economically vibrant, youthful, and 
growing populations are at the heart of realizing that vision, 
which is why the Administration has made clear our commitment 
to ASEAN and its centrality. Our relationship is about 
collaboration to meet shared challenges and opportunities, 
including health security, energy and climate issues, and the 
economic prosperity of our combined one billion people. If 
confirmed, I would look to build on the recent U.S.-ASEAN 
Special Summit, including by continuing a whole-of-government 
effort to build ASEAN's own capacity to act on its interests.
    Our vision for the U.S.-ASEAN relationship is a positive 
one; it is defined by what we are for. At the same time, I am 
clear-eyed about the challenge that coercive activity by the 
People's Republic of China poses to that vision. It is in the 
national security interests of the United States for ASEAN to 
be strong, prosperous, united, and well-equipped to set the 
terms of its relationship with the PRC. Nowhere is that truer 
than when it comes to the PRC's increasing maritime 
assertiveness in the South China Sea. If confirmed, I will work 
with ASEAN to pursue our shared interests in maintaining peace 
and stability, respect of international law, and freedoms of 
navigation and overflight in the South China Sea.
    A critical component of advancing our interests is standing 
up for our values. As President Biden has said, human rights 
are a vital interest of this administration's foreign policy. 
If confirmed, I will not hesitate to raise issues of human 
rights, democracy, and rule of law with interlocutors across 
the region. I have been moved by the tragic and disturbing 
crisis in Burma, including the horrific and widespread violence 
perpetrated by the Burmese regime against the people of Burma. 
If confirmed, I will support efforts to change the regime's 
calculus so that we can resolve the worsening humanitarian and 
political crisis and return Burma to a path toward inclusive, 
multiparty democracy.
    Above all, if the U.S.-ASEAN relationship is to continue to 
deliver for our peoples in the 21st century, it must be 
durable. The return of a Senate-confirmed Ambassador to this 
seat in Jakarta, which has been filled on an acting basis for 
more than 5 years, would be a step in that direction, sending a 
powerful message to ASEAN and the world of American commitment 
to Southeast Asia and its premier institution.
    If I am confirmed to this post, I would take as my 
responsibility to ensure the long-term success of this vital 
relationship. To do so, I would draw on the most important 
sources of stable, long-term U.S. engagement with the region: 
bipartisan cooperation and people-to-people ties. If confirmed, 
I would look to build on already strong Congressional support 
for U.S. engagement with ASEAN. I would also support our 
thriving people-to-people programs, including the Young 
Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, that strengthen our 
already-strong bonds of friendship.
    Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and members of the 
committee, thank you again for the opportunity to appear before 
you today and your consideration of my nomination.
    I look forward to your questions.

   STATEMENT OF RICHARD LEE BUANGAN, OF CALIFORNIA, A CAREER 
    MEMBER OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER 
    COUNSELOR, NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND 
  PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO MONGOLIA

    Mr. Buangan. Thank you very much. Chairman Schatz, Ranking 
Member Romney, and distinguished members of the committee, I am 
deeply honored to be here today as the President's nominee to 
serve as the United States Ambassador to Mongolia. I am 
grateful for the confidence of President Biden and Secretary 
Blinken in entrusting me with this important responsibility. If 
confirmed, I look forward to working closely with this 
committee to advance U.S. priorities in Mongolia and further 
strengthening our bilateral partnership. I deeply appreciate 
the crucial role Congress plays in the foreign policy process.
    I want to take a moment to acknowledge my parents, Art and 
Evelyn, who are joining me all the way from San Diego, 
California, my brother, Jay, his wife, Joyce, my nieces Arya, 
Emma, and Caras, as well as my friends, family, and colleagues 
who are watching from around the world. They have been a source 
of inspiration and strength for me throughout my 23-year 
journey as a Foreign Service Officer. If confirmed, I look 
forward to working alongside our Embassy Ulaanbaatar team, my 
American colleagues as well as our locally engaged Mongolian 
staff, who have been the linchpin of our deep and abiding 
relationship with the Mongolian people for decades.
    This year marks the 35th anniversary of the establishment 
of diplomatic relations with Mongolia and 30 years since its 
peaceful transition to democracy. During this time, the United 
States has worked closely with Mongolia to strengthen its 
commitment to human rights and the rule of law, to promote 
democratic values, and to expand defense cooperation.
    Mongolia continually seeks increased U.S. engagement, 
trade, and investment. We are proud to call Mongolia a 
strategic partner.
    The U.S.-Mongolia relationship is built on a foundation of 
shared values and common interests. If confirmed, I will focus 
on efforts to bolster Mongolia's democratic and economic 
institutions. Our goal is to support the Mongolian people in 
building a strong, resilient, democratic system and a 
prosperous, private sector-driven economy that can play a 
constructive role in the international community.
    I would like to comment on a few specific issues.
    First, Mongolia is at a critical juncture in its energy 
transition. With abundant reserves of coal and other minerals, 
Mongolia is dependent on extractive industries both to meet its 
own energy needs and to generate foreign exchange. At the same 
time, Mongolia has huge potential for clean energy, ranging 
from hydropower to solar and wind. If confirmed, I will strive 
to help Mongolia begin the transition to a clean energy future.
    Second, given Mongolia's ongoing economic and geostrategic 
challenges, U.S. development support remains critical to 
helping this country move forward. For example, the U.S. 
Government's largest investment in Mongolia is the Millennium 
Challenge Corporation's $350 million Water Compact, which will 
redevelop Ulaanbaatar's water and wastewater system and 
increase the city's supply of water by 80 percent when 
completed in 2026. Separately, the U.S. International 
Development Finance Corporation manages a $38 million portfolio 
while USAID projects support small and medium-sized 
enterprises, empower women and youth, and improve energy 
governance.
    Third, the United States and Mongolia view military-to-
military cooperation as a cornerstone of our relationship. The 
United States is grateful for the service of Mongolian soldiers 
who have served alongside U.S. and NATO coalition partners in 
Afghanistan. Furthermore, the U.S. military provides extensive 
assistance and training to improve the Mongolian Armed Forces' 
information infrastructure, engineering capabilities, and 
readiness for peacekeeping operations. If confirmed, I will 
support efforts to continue expanding Mongolia's already 
impressive U.N. peacekeeping operations capability.
    Finally, turning to public diplomacy, I believe it is 
critical to strengthen our people-to-people exchanges with 
Mongolians, particularly with youth, who are increasingly eager 
to seek opportunities to study abroad and develop closer ties 
with the United States and other free-market open societies.
    Over the years our exchange programs have reaped dividends, 
fostering relations with Mongolians from all walks of life. 
Numerous senior military leaders, prominent persons in business 
and finance, and influential members of civil society and 
academia, as well as one-third of current parliamentarians, are 
alumni of U.S. exchange or training programs.
    One important key to improving our people-to-people ties is 
supporting English language education in Mongolia. 
Approximately 100 Peace Corps volunteers each year taught 
English across the country until COVID-19 forced volunteers to 
return to the United States in 2020. As Ambassador, I would 
commit to seeing this vital program return to, and even exceed, 
prior levels as quickly as possible.
    Chairman Schatz, Ranking Member Romney, committee members, 
it would be the honor of a lifetime to represent my country as 
a U.S. Ambassador and lead the outstanding staff of the U.S. 
mission to Mongolia. If confirmed, I look forward to working 
with Congress to continue deepening ties with our strategic 
partner Mongolia, while also paying tribute to the rich culture 
and history of the Mongolian people and helping their 
government meet the challenges of the 21st century.
    Thank you for your time, and I look forward to answering 
your questions.

capabilities, and readiness for peacekeeping operations. If confirmed, 
I will support efforts to continue expanding Mongolia's already 
impressive U.N. peacekeeping operations capability.
    Finally, turning to public diplomacy, I believe it is critical to 
strengthen our people-to-people exchanges with Mongolians, particularly 
with youth, who are increasingly eager to seek opportunities to study 
abroad and develop closer ties with the United States and other free-
market open societies.

    Over the years we have received an excellent return on our 
investments in exchanges in general. Numerous senior military leaders, 
prominent persons in business and finance, and influential members of 
civil society and academia, as well as one-third of current 
parliamentarians, are alumni of U.S. exchange or training programs.
    One important key to improving our people-to-people ties is 
supporting English language education in Mongolia. Approximately 100 
Peace Corps volunteers each year taught English across the country 
until COVID-19 forced volunteers to return to the United States in 
2020. As Ambassador, I would commit to seeing this vital program return 
to, and even exceed, prior levels as quickly as possible.
    Chairman Schatz, Ranking Member Romney, committee members, it would 
be the honor of a lifetime to represent my country as a U.S. Ambassador 
and lead the outstanding staff of the U.S. Mission to Mongolia. If 
confirmed, I look forward to working with Congress to continue 
deepening ties with our strategic partner Mongolia, while also paying 
tribute to the rich culture and history of the Mongolian people and 
helping their government meet the challenges of the 21st century.
    Thank you for your time and I look forward to answering your 
questions.


    Senator Schatz. Thank you very much.
    Ms. Damour, please proceed with your testimony.

 STATEMENT OF MARIE C. DAMOUR, OF VIRGINIA, A CAREER MEMBER OF 
         THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-
    COUNSELOR,NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND 
PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC 
   OF FIJI, AND TO SERVE CONCURRENTLY AND WITHOUT ADDITIONAL 
COMPENSATION AS AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF 
 THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF KIRIBATI, THE 
      REPUBLIC OF NAURU, THE KINGDOM OF TONGA, AND TUVALU

    Ms. Damour. Chairman Schatz, Ranking Member Romney, and 
distinguished members of the committee, I am honored to be here 
today as the President's nominee to serve as the United States 
Ambassador to the Republics of Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, the 
Kingdom of Tonga, and Tuvalu. I am grateful for the confidence 
shown by President Biden and Secretary Blinken in entrusting me 
with this important responsibility and, if confirmed, I look 
forward to working with Congress to advance the interests of 
the United States by reinvigorating our ties with our Pacific 
neighbors.
    I would like to take a few minutes to acknowledge my 
family, without whose support and guidance I would not be here. 
My father, Alfred Damour, established a model of public service 
for my three brothers and me throughout his career as an 
officer in the U.S. Army, including active duty during the war 
in Vietnam. My mother provided for me the best example of how a 
woman can and should pursue individual goals in a professional 
career while simultaneously caring for her family and 
community. Their values and the example they set guide me each 
and every day. While my brothers and their families could not 
be here today, I know they are here in spirit. I also want to 
thank the many Foreign Service, Civil Service, and local 
employee colleagues with whom I have had the honor to serve 
over the course of my 29-year career in the Department.
    My experiences have taught me the power of our country's 
values-based diplomacy. If confirmed, I will draw on these 
lessons and my regional policy experience to advance the United 
States' strategic interests in the South Pacific, because the 
United States is a Pacific power. We share an important history 
with our Pacific Island neighbors. It was in the islands that 
Americans braved some of the hardest-fought battles of the 
Second World War, forging connections that are not easily 
forgotten. Our peoples are knit through a large Pacific 
Islander diaspora in the United States. If confirmed, I will 
work in collaboration with the five nations to which I would be 
accredited to ensure that our common future is one of 
prosperity, peace, and stability.
    President Biden has made addressing the climate crisis one 
of his administration's top priorities for good reason: our 
Pacific neighbors are experiencing the most devastating impacts 
of climate change, particularly Kiribati and Tuvalu, two of the 
lowest-lying atoll nations for which this is an existential 
issue. As Secretary Blinken stated during his trip to Fiji this 
year, every defining issue of the 21st century runs through 
this region: the climate crisis, global health, the future of 
technology, whether nations will be free to chart their own 
path or be subject to coercion by more powerful nations.
    If confirmed, I will listen and work with our Pacific 
partners to advance solutions that will support Pacific 
communities and help them adapt to the impacts of climate 
change, address public health issues, support better 
communication, and preserve international rules and standards.
    The Pacific Islands are global players. Both Fiji and Tonga 
have been important contributors to international Peacekeeping 
Operations. Fijian forces are currently participating in 
various United Nations missions, where they are responsible for 
providing security for mission personnel and facilities. Tonga 
was an early member of the Coalition to liberate Iraq. 
Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu are committed to their 
responsibilities as U.N. members, and the United States 
cooperates closely with them on a wide range of issues in that 
forum. All five nations boldly supported Ukraine in the United 
Nations. If confirmed, I look forward to continuing to build 
this regional and global cooperation.
    Success in tackling our common challenges will depend on 
fostering the internal strength of our Pacific Island partners 
that comes from strong democratic institutions, rule of law, 
and respect for human rights. The Pacific Islanders share our 
respect for democratic values but realizing those values can be 
challenging in practice. If confirmed, I will strive to build 
civil society, democracy, and good governance through all means 
available to us.
    Embassy Suva is responsible for the United States' largest 
geographic consular district in the world, over two million 
square miles. It is challenged by almost yearly cyclones, 
floods, and tsunami warnings. If confirmed, I will make 
disaster preparedness and support for U.S. citizens a priority 
focus.
    My career at the State Department has taught me that our 
people are our most precious resource. If confirmed, it will be 
my privilege to lead Embassy Suva's diverse and dedicated team 
of American and local staff and welcome the return of Peace 
Corps volunteers.
    Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and distinguished members 
of the committee, thank you very much for your consideration 
and the opportunity to appear before you today. I look forward 
to your comments and questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Damour follows:]

    Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and distinguished members of the 
committee, thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to 
appear before you today. I look forward to your comments and questions.


    Senator Schatz. Thank you very much. Before we get into 
members' questions I have a few questions that speak to the 
importance that this committee places on responsiveness by all 
officials in the Executive branch and that we expect and will 
be seeking from you. I would ask each of you to provide just a 
yes or a no answer, and we will start with Ms. Damour and go 
down the line.
    If you are confirmed, do you agree to appear before this 
committee and make officials from your office available to the 
committee and designated staff when invited?
    Ms. Damour. Yes.
    Mr. Buangan. Yes.
    Mr. Abraham. Yes.
    Mr. Godec. Yes.
    Mr. Thompson. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. Do you commit to keeping this committee 
fully and currently informed about the activities under your 
purview?
    Ms. Damour. Yes.
    Mr. Buangan. Yes.
    Mr. Abraham. Yes.
    Mr. Godec. Yes.
    Mr. Thompson. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. Do you commit to engaging in meaningful 
consultation while policies are being developed, not just 
providing notification after the fact?
    Ms. Damour. Yes.
    Mr. Buangan. Yes.
    Mr. Abraham. Yes.
    Mr. Godec. Yes.
    Mr. Thompson. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. Do you commit to promptly responding to 
requests for briefings and information requested by the 
committee and its designated staff?
    Ms. Damour. Yes.
    Mr. Buangan. Yes.
    Mr. Abraham. Yes.
    Mr. Godec. Yes.
    Mr. Thompson. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you very much. I will now turn to 
Ranking Member Romney for his questions.
    Senator Romney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Some years ago I 
was at the home of a man who would become president of 
Afghanistan, and people there were explaining to me their view 
as to why the Taliban had been so successful up until that 
point, and they said they had such a powerful message. I said, 
``What is that message?'' and they said, ``Well, infidels are 
on Islamic land, and the infidels must be expelled.'' And I 
said, ``What is our message?'' And there was a long silence, 
and finally one of the individuals said, ``Well, our message is 
that before the Americans came it used to take 4 hours to get 
to the nearest city out of Kabul and now it only takes an 
hour.'' And I thought to myself, that is not a message to die 
for, and fighting for freedom is a fight that typically 
involves potential loss of life.
    I would like to ask each of you, in turn, what you have 
already testified, what are messages to the people of the 
nation or nations that you will represent us in, what are the 
messages as to why America, as opposed to the alternative, 
which I presume in each case would be China. There is a global 
competition between nations that are interested in freedom and 
democracy and those that want to become authoritarian regimes. 
Why America? Why associate with us as opposed to, if you will, 
joining the Chinese?
    Please, Mr. Thompson.
    Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Romney. Yeah, your microphone. Sorry.
    Mr. Thompson. Is it on? Okay. Sorry about that. Yes, I 
would look forward to delivering a message that tells the 
people of Nepal that America is standing with them is about 
their sovereignty, about their territorial integrity, and about 
their ability to make decisions for themselves about their 
future and the prosperity of their nation. And so I think that 
will stand in very sharp contrast to a lot of the messaging 
they hear in the region.
    Senator Romney. Thank you. Very helpful.
    Mr. Godec. Senator, if confirmed, I would very much bring 
to Thailand a message about all the values that America stands 
for--freedom, democracy, human rights, and so many other 
things. I would also listen to what the Thai want and 
understand where Thailand is coming from, and work to make 
certain that our message about the United States is both clear 
and offers opportunities to Thailand that the Thai people 
themselves are looking for.
    One of the things that I believe is a great advantage of 
the United States is the tapestry that we have, as I mentioned. 
This is not just government-to-government, business-to-
business, NGO-to-NGO. It is so many other things. So I think 
that ensuring that we are working with all of the diverse 
things that America brings when it forms a relationship with 
another country, with another people and its citizens, the 
citizens of that country, that there are real opportunities 
here, opportunities that the country, I believe, will have an 
interest in.
    So I would very strongly seek both to bring a message 
about, again, our values, listen to the Thai, understand where 
they are coming from, and then at the same time support and 
bring assistance to all of the other parts of what we, as 
Americans bring. And I think it stands, frankly, in contrast, 
to what is offered by the PRC, which is a much more centrally 
directed, much more directive situation, and I do not think it 
would be nearly as attractive to the Thai. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Romney. Thank you. Mr. Abraham?
    Mr. Abraham. Senator, thank you for the question. If 
confirmed, I would bring to the nations of ASEAN a message that 
is really centered in our shared commitment to a free and open 
Indo-Pacific, one where countries and individuals are free to 
pursue their interests without fear of, or impacts of, 
coercion. I would bring a message of solidarity with their 
aspirations for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and 
importantly in support of those aspirations I would bring a 
message of durable, longstanding, and sustaining U.S. 
commitment to our relationship with both ASEAN and the nations 
of ASEAN.
    Senator Romney. Thank you. Mr. Buangan?
    Mr. Buangan. Thank you very much, Senator, for that. If I 
am confirmed, I would tell the Mongolian people very simply 
that as a fellow democracy we have to stand shoulder-to-
shoulder with you. Democracies work. Your democratic system 
works. We have a vested interest in ensuring that your 
democracy is strong and resilient. We want to see you prosper 
and secure in your own right and make sovereign decisions 
without fear of coercion from your neighbors. We want to help 
you build strong economic, open-market systems that allow you 
to make independent, sovereign decisions about your investment, 
about your prosperity, about the lives you want to lead.
    And I would simply tell them that we are your friend and 
partner. We are far away from each other and we Mongolia and 
the United States could not be farther apart, but we are a lot 
closer than you think in terms of our shared values and our 
commitment to democratic institutions. Thank you.
    Senator Romney. Thank you. Ms. Damour.
    Ms. Damour. Think you, Senator. Our message to our Pacific 
Island neighbors is simple. As we were standing shoulder-to-
shoulder 80 years ago, the United States remains committed to 
helping them sustain their sovereignty, maintain their 
territorial integrity, achieve sustainable economic 
development, and help them preserve their ability to make 
choices in the best interests of their people. We are their 
neighbor. We are their partner. That is our commitment. Thank 
you.
    Senator Romney. Thank you. Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Ranking Member Romney. Senator 
Cardin.
    Senator Cardin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First let me thank 
all five of our nominees for their public service and their 
willingness to continue to serve during extremely challenging 
times, and we thank your families because we know it is a 
family sacrifice. So thank you for being willing to do this.
    I want to focus on some of the human rights issues and the 
influence of China in the region. So first, Mr. Godec, let me 
talk a little bit about Thailand. Obviously, they play a key 
role in regard to the crisis in Burma, and you mentioned that 
during your testimony. I want to bring up an issue in 
trafficking in persons. The most recent report, they went 
backwards from being on Tier 2 to Tier 2 watchlist. The report 
spells out the challenges they have with forced labor as well 
as sex trafficking.
    So tell me your commitment, if confirmed, as to how you 
will promote Thailand taking the necessary steps to end this 
form of modern-day slavery.
    Mr. Godec. Thank you for the question, Senator. You raised 
a very important issue. Thailand has had a significant problem 
with trafficking in persons. That was reflected in the change 
in its ranking, its downgrade, and its ranking.
    This is a subject that we talk to the Thai about regularly, 
at the highest levels. It is a subject where the United States, 
through a number of agencies, has provided some support and 
assistance to try to get some improvement. We have seen some 
progress, but there is a lot more that remains to be done. And 
I would commit, if confirmed, to doing everything possible to 
make progress.
    I would note that the Prime Minister recently did a public 
event, for example, where he gave recognition to a number of 
agencies and people who were doing some things in this area. 
And it is good to see high-level engagement but there is a lot 
that needs to be done in this area.
    Senator Cardin. We have a lot of issues with Thailand. We 
recognize that. We are trying to make advancements, 
particularly as it relates to humanitarian issues in Burma. Do 
we have your assurances that you will give objective 
observations as to the progress they are making on trafficking? 
We have seen, in the past, sometimes other politics enter into 
this. This is too fundamental of a human rights commitment, 
that you will give us objective accounts as to the progress or 
lack of progress in that country?
    Mr. Godec. Absolutely, Senator, I will do that. I have done 
it in my previous positions and I would commit to doing it 
again.
    Senator Cardin. Thank you. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Buangan, in regard to Mongolia, Mongolia is an 
interesting country. It is now a member of the OSCE so we deal 
with them in the Helsinki Commission. They believe they have 
two geographical neighbors in China and Russia but they 
consider their third neighbor to be the United States. So we 
have seen a significant strategic partnership with the United 
States that can clearly be improved.
    I just really want to make the observation there is strong 
support here in the Senate to expand trade opportunities and 
other opportunities with Mongolia, because we see this as a 
real opportunity for America to have a strong strategic partner 
in the region.
    Mr. Buangan. Thank you very much for that comment, Senator. 
I could not agree more. We are their third neighbor. In fact, 
we are their preferred third neighbor. They are also seeking to 
expand relationships with other open-market economies and 
democracies like Japan and South Korea.
    But you are exactly right. We need to be able to do more to 
help them build strong, resilient democratic systems, open-
market economies, given the challenge that they are neighbors 
with China and Russia and the overwhelming influence and 
coercion that those two countries are bearing right now on 
Mongolia.
    Senator Cardin. Ms. Damour, I just really want to tell you 
how excited we are about having a confirmed ambassador for the 
five countries that you refer to. I dare say that many 
Americans do not even know the names of some of these Pacific 
Island states. When we look at their influence in the United 
Nations and other entities it can play an important role for 
U.S. strategic diplomacy. The same thing is true with the 
Caribbean island states that are very small, and we generally 
do not pay much attention to.
    China is paying attention to the five countries that you 
would be represent us at. So we do look forward to you giving 
us some concrete recommendations as to how we can strengthen 
our ties in these countries. It does not take very much. Paying 
a little bit of attention to them is what they really want. But 
we are going to need a game plan on how we can strengthen our 
ties with these countries and use that as a model in other 
areas where the United States has really been missing in action 
and China has been moving very aggressively.
    Ms. Damour. Senator, thank you very much for those 
comments, and I think you are right. I think a lot of Americans 
could not find Kiribati on a map. But everybody knows about the 
Battle of Tarawa. We understand our historic role in that 
region. And I was very pleased to see the announcement 
yesterday of the intent of the Biden-Harris administration, 
subject to notification and consultation with Congress, to open 
two new embassies, in Tonga and in Kiribati. If confirmed, I 
very much look forward to being part of the process to 
developing the first U.S. national strategy for the Pacific 
Islands.
    You are absolutely right. We need to show up. We need to up 
our game. We need to be there in person. And I would certainly 
hope, if confirmed, I would be able to consult with you, the 
members of the committee and your staffs, on how we can ensure 
consistent, sustained, high-level visits to the region to 
demonstrate in person that we are there and we are part of 
their future. Thank you.
    Senator Cardin. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Senator Cardin. Just following 
up on that line of questioning, Ms. Damour, the announcement 
yesterday was a really good start. I had a constructive 
conversation with several Pacific Island nation ambassadors 
about a month ago here in the Senate, and there were two issues 
that were flagged for me where they thought our presence could 
be very useful and it probably would not cost that much money 
or be an expenditure of an unusual amount of political capital. 
That is obviously IUU and telehealth. We have seen such an 
extraordinary expansion of telehealth in the United States over 
the last 8 or so years, particularly during the pandemic but 
even preceding that. They are very, very interested in what we 
can do in that space.
    I do not need you to be an expert right now on telehealth 
but I would love your commitment to flesh out these two issues. 
IUU is pretty well articulated. We know what we need to do. We 
just need to be present there. I think there are opportunities 
in terms of utilizing technology, drones in particular, to be 
more present in the region, to stop pirate fishing.
    But on the telehealth side, people's eyes lit up when we 
started to talk about the opportunities there. I would like you 
to comment on that.
    Ms. Damour. thank you very much, Senator. I agree, two of 
the issues that we need to be dealing with our global health 
issues in the region and maritime security, and if confirmed, I 
very much look forward to working with colleagues in the Indo-
Pacific Command, with the U.S. Coast Guard. We already have 
shiprider agreements with all five of these nations that help 
them police and sustain their own resources. I would love to 
see if there is more we can do in that area.
    And I certainly think during the COVID pandemic we have all 
seen an increase of telemedicine so that people, even in remote 
areas, could access health care. So thank you very much for 
raising that, sir. Our health cooperation is a very important 
part of our cooperation in these nations, and I would be very 
interested to continue that discussion, if confirmed. Thank 
you, sir.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you very much. Just two comments. One 
on IUU. There is a tendency to think that the only way to be 
present is to be underway. I just really us to use technology 
to be present and not have to sort of multiply the number of 
Coast Guard vessels and Navy vessels, because at some point 
that becomes impractical from a financial standpoint.
    The other thing is yes, everybody needs broadband and we 
should try to be of assistance there, but not all telehealth 
requires a high-speed internet connection, and we need to 
explore those opportunities, even as we try to help people get 
better broadband connection.
    Mr. Abraham, what opportunities do you see for the United 
States to engage ASEAN on environmental issues, including 
combatting deforestation and managing water systems such as the 
Mekong?
    Mr. Abraham. Senator, thank you for the question. As you 
know, the nations of Southeast Asia are on the front lines of 
the impacts of climate change and issues surrounding 
sustainability. I mentioned the Young Southeast Asian Leaders 
Program in my opening testimony. One of the things that I know 
we hear from young leaders in the region is their deep-seated 
conviction that we need to act on issues of climate change 
together. if confirmed,, that would certainly be an area of 
focus in my engagement with ASEAN. It has been a part of this 
administration's engagement of ASEAN, including through the 
special ASEAN Summits. And I would look to work closely with 
you and with partners in the region and with Congress on where 
further opportunities lie.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you. And before moving on to Senator 
Van Hollen for his questions I just want to point out on the 
deforestation side, you know, we have the Lacey Act, and we all 
know that illegally deforested products are impermissible from 
an import standpoint in the United States. But the truth is 
that most of the illegal deforestation is commodity driven, and 
so we are going to need to deal with that question, which is to 
say a lot of clear-cutting happens for the purpose of growing 
commodities that we then import, and that is not covered by the 
Lacey Act. So we need to do something on the statutory side, 
but there is also a fair amount of room to maneuver at ASEAN 
and through USTR.
    So thank you all for your testimony and your willingness to 
serve. Senator Van Hollen.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good to 
see you all again. Congratulations again on your nominations.
    Ambassador Godec, let me start with you. As has been 
mentioned, the United States and Thailand recently released a 
communique on our strategic alliance and partnership. That 
communique reads, in part, that it is grounded in, quote, ``our 
collective commitment to build resilient, inclusive democracies 
and advance human rights,'' end quote.
    At the same time, the U.N. Office of High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International 
have all criticized Thailand's laws that essentially prohibit 
criticism of the monarchy. And, in fact, in February 2021, a 
U.N. Office of Human Rights panel of experts said, quote, ``We 
have repeatedly emphasized that these laws have no place in a 
democratic country. Their increasingly harsh application has 
had the effect of chilling freedom of expression and further 
restricting civic space and enjoyment of fundamental freedoms 
in Thailand,'' end quote.
    As you know, there are many people in prison right now in 
Thailand for simply criticizing the king and monarchy. Can you 
just talk about how you will address those issues, if confirmed 
as Ambassador to Thailand?
    Mr. Godec. Thank you, Senator, for the important question. 
The United States certainly respects the institution of the 
Thai monarchy. We understand the esteem with which the Thai 
people hold the royal family. That said, freedom of expression 
is critical, and I would emphasize, both publicly and 
privately, the importance of allowing people to freely express 
their ideas without threat of arrest. I would certainly, as I 
have done in my previous postings, both Kenya and Tunisia, make 
every effort again to protect the freedom of expression.
    I would also emphasize the importance that anyone who has 
been arrested be treated appropriately, with full respect for 
their fundamental rights and that they receive due process. And 
I would make certain to put an emphasis on that as well.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, and look, I support our 
partnership with Thailand, but when I see statements stating 
that we have sort of this collective commitment to human rights 
I think it is important that we make clear our differences on 
those issues with Thailand.
    Mr. Godec. Absolutely, Senator.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you.
    Mr. Buangan, with respect to Mongolia, we know that 
Mongolia relies on about 90 percent of their oil imports from 
Russia. Any thoughts on what we can do to address that issue 
and reduce that reliance?
    Mr. Buangan. Thank you for that question, Senator. Mongolia 
does find itself in a very complex geopolitical environment 
given their dependency on not just Russia but also the PRC, and 
in addition to relying on Russian oil imports and other energy 
imports they are completely also dependent on coal. So I think 
there are two opportunities here. I see one an environmental 
challenge, with their commitment to climate change, to help 
them facilitate and expedite their transition to clean and 
renewable energy that can be done in Mongolia. But also I think 
it is incumbent on the U.S. to ensure that they have strong 
economic systems that would allow them to find ways to further 
investment outside of China and the PRC.
    We have to accept the reality that they have close ties 
with Russia. I think that is something that many Mongolians 
want. But at the same time we should be able to allow them to 
do it in a way that respects their ability to do it, that does 
not threaten their sovereignty, and does not coerce them or 
force them to make decisions that they do not want to make.
    So I think with respect to energy there is a lot of 
opportunity there where we can help them transition to that.
    Senator Van Hollen. I appreciate that. As you indicate, 
they are sort of in a very tough spot geographically, with both 
Russia and the PRC. And just with respect to climate change--
and I do not have time to get into it, but Mr. Thompson, as you 
know, Nepal is especially vulnerable to the impact of climate 
change, given the Himalayan glaciers, and I look forward to 
continuing the conversation with you on that.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Schatz. Senator Booker.
    Senator Booker. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    First of all I just want to take a step back and say thank 
you to all of you for being here. I am one of these folks that 
walks around this place and every once in a while has to stop 
and just take stock of the reality that we are sitting here in 
the Capitol of the greatest country on earth, all of us 
stepping forward to serve, make sacrifices to do so. But the 
work we all do is incredibly important and it can make a 
difference for millions and millions of people. So I celebrate 
you all. I thank you all for, many of you, very long careers of 
service and putting yourself forth again to step into often 
difficult situations and try, amidst the chaos of humanity, to 
find good, to do good, and to make for a better future. So 
thank you all for that.
    Mr. Thompson, I really want to focus on you because I just 
recently came back from Nepal, as I think you know, and it was 
an extraordinary, eye-opening trip. It was sort of one of the 
last countries we tagged onto a longer codel, but when I got 
there I found myself thanking God that I was able to visit the 
country because I learned so much. And this small nation, set 
between two titans, India and China, has had this difficult 
balancing act for a very, very long time.
    And maybe I want to start with China and their 
extraordinary influence in the nation. You have a country that 
in the last year or so accounts for about 78 percent of all the 
investment in Nepal, but at the same time, as we talk with 
government officials, they really want to deepen their 
relationship with us. You know the economic agreement that we 
just got signed literally with China trying to put 
disinformation and trying to undermine our ability to deepen 
these economic ties. The new prime minister there seems to be 
really committed to an independent relationship with America 
but not seem like we are just trying to exploit that 
relationship to counter China. They want to be understood as 
someone that has to stand on their own.
    And I am wondering if you can give me just a brief view of 
how you take your mission and how to strengthen our 
relationship as China continues to try to expand its influence 
and, frankly, undermine the autonomy of the country.
    Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Senator. It was a great privilege 
to brief you and the other members of the codel that traveled. 
We really appreciate the fact that you were able to tag Nepal 
on and have such a good experience. I know the Embassy there 
reported back very favorably about all the discussions that you 
had.
    You are absolutely right. This is a critical issue for 
Nepal as they balance their interests. I had mentioned in my 
opening statement, you talked about two titans. They often are 
referred to as a yam between two boulders. And as Prime 
Minister Deuba seeks to develop the economy, to find a path 
forward for Nepal that represents the real interests of the 
Nepal people, this can be a challenging neighborhood in which 
to do it.
    You are absolutely right. The Millennium Challenge 
Corporation Compact provides a huge game-changing opportunity 
for them to have greater connectivity with the electricity grid 
in South Asia, to build better transportation networks, to 
allow them to expand their trade opportunities as a nation. We 
are also looking at other opportunities, Senator, such as 
through the Development Finance Corporation and our USAID 
mission to help develop market-oriented opportunities with 
entrepreneurs, with greater business and investment climate.
    And so if confirmed, I would look forward to really 
engaging very deeply on these fronts, because we are at a 
critical juncture for this type of opportunity.
    Senator Booker. Well, I hope you see me and I imagine a lot 
of other members of that codel as allies in this. I am not 
overstating this. I think we all fell in love with Nepal and 
its people, and it was an extraordinary experience. And on that 
note let me make the last point to you. I had never seen the 
Himalayas before, and as we flew by them I saw people on the 
plane with me looking out at this incredible mountain range 
with tears in their eyes, getting very emotional at the majesty 
of the mountains. But we also were coming off of understanding 
that Nepal is one of the top five countries on the planet right 
now that are suffering the effects of climate change. And I was 
stunned at how devastating the growing warmth is doing to that 
country and really threatening--I mean, 20 percent of the water 
that humanity gets is coming from the Himalayas, and right now 
climate change is causing havoc and threatens extraordinary 
destruction, not to mention deprivation.
    So this, I see, as an urgency. I knew it intellectually but 
to experience it on the ground, to talk to people who are 
trying to think of creative ways to deal with this. So I am 
hoping you see that as part of your mission as well and to help 
us, as policymakers and lawmakers, try to find ways to help 
especially these very vulnerable nations who are feeling, from 
island nations to many in the mountains who are going to feel 
the devastating effects of this, which will not only cause 
economic damage but it will cause political instability as 
well.
    Mr. Thompson. We look forward to working with the 
committee, with our colleagues at the Department on this front. 
You are absolutely right. It is critically important. Nepal 
made some very ambitious pledges at the Cop26. We will continue 
through our assistance programs to seek ways to help them adapt 
and mitigate climate change. It is a high priority for us, 
absolutely, if confirmed.
    Senator Booker. And again, thank you for your kindness to 
me before that incredible trip.
    Mr. Thompson. Thank you.
    Senator Schatz. Senator Hagerty.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Senator Schatz and Senator 
Romney, for holding this hearing, and to all of the nominees 
here today I want to congratulate you. Should you be confirmed 
you are going to have the unique opportunity and responsibility 
to represent the most exceptional nation in the world, and you 
are going to a region that is very critical right now, critical 
to our nation's security but critical to the world's security.
    And ASEAN, I think, is going to continue to play a very, 
very critical role to advance the vision that my good friend, 
former Prime Minister Abe articulated in terms of a free and 
open Indo-Pacific. And it was a great honor for me to work with 
him to deepen our alliance in that region and to expand that 
vision. It is a vision that I think has tremendous amount of 
opportunity for us and it is one that I think we should explore 
every opportunity to deepen.
    Mr. Abraham, I would like to turn to you and talk about 
your view with respect to the Quad's relationship to ASEAN, and 
to get your perspective in terms of how we can provide key 
resources. I think there is a tremendous opportunity here, 
whether it be infrastructure resources through the Blue Dot 
Network, facilitating vaccines or new technologies. But I would 
like to get your perspective on how we can deepen our 
relationship in the Quad framework in ASEAN.
    Mr. Abraham. Senator, thank you for the question and thank 
you for your leadership in the region. If confirmed, one of the 
things that I would be most enthusiastic about doing is trying 
to find ways, consistent with our views around ASEAN 
centrality, to create greater connectivity within the region, 
within the various institutional pieces of the regional 
framework, one of them being the Quad.
    I think we have seen some progress to that end and there 
are some interesting areas of both common interest and 
potential collaboration. The one I would point to, which 
certainly speaks to a broader priority I would bring, if 
confirmed, surrounds our commitment to freedom of navigation 
and overflight into the maritime security of the region. During 
the Biden-Harris administration, the quad has announced and 
taken steps towards providing, as a public good, some data 
transparency tools around maritime domain awareness. That is a 
public good that would absolutely be impactful to our work with 
ASEAN and with ASEAN member nations, and I think it is 
illustrative of areas of common interest that I would hope to 
build upon.
    You touched on health security. I also think there are 
great opportunities for collaboration there, as was noted at 
the tail end of the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit recently.
    Senator Hagerty. Again, I encourage you to take every 
opportunity you can to find ways to not only deepen our 
relationships with ASEAN but to bring that into the framework 
in a constructive manner with the Quad.
    Mr. Abraham. Yes, sir.
    Senator Hagerty. Mr. Buangan, I would like to turn to you 
to talk about Mongolia. Mongolia has been regarded as an oasis 
of democracy within the authoritarian desert of Eurasia. 
Mongolia also has a rich history dating back to the times of 
Genghis Khan. We are also aware of the fact that the Chinese 
Communist Party makes very human efforts to dilute the cultures 
of ethnic groups such as the Uighurs in Xinjiang.
    The Chinese Communist Party is attempting to do the same 
thing with Mongolian heritage and culture, as you know, I am 
certain. In 2020, the Chinese Communist Party demanded the 
removal of the words ``Genghis Khan,'' the word ``empire,'' and 
``Mongol'' from a museum exhibition in France. The Chinese 
Communist Party wants to airbrush its history to minimize the 
important role of ethnic minorities such as the Mongols. And, 
in addition, the Chinese Communist Party is intensifying its 
pressure on ethnic Mongolians that are living in China, to 
suppress their local language, to suppress their culture.
    Mr. Buangan, in your view what are the objectives of the 
Chinese Communist Party in seeking to dilute the Mongolian 
heritage and culture and what are your plans to help Mongolia 
diversify away from China and those pressures that it is 
feeling?
    Mr. Buangan. Thank you so much for that question, Senator, 
and I appreciate your concern to that. I think the vast 
majority of Mongolians will agree and be pleased to hear your 
concern for that and particularly as it relates to the PRC's 
attempts to dilute the culture and religious traditions of 
ethnic minorities in China. It is something that we have seen. 
Mongolia, both its people and its Government, have been 
following the developments, in Inner Mongolia in particular. 
They are concerned about it. They are tracking it. But because 
of China's enormous economic leverage that they have with 
Mongolia it is very difficult for them to speak out.
    But in that vein, what I would say is that we, at the U.S. 
Embassy--and this is something that I would certainly 
prioritize if I am confirmed--is that we have a lot of programs 
with Mongolians where we celebrate their culture, where we help 
them preserve a lot of their rich, diverse culture. I would 
point to a couple of examples that we do. Our Ambassador's Fund 
for Cultural Preservation, for example, just awarded a grant to 
the National Library of Mongolia to help them preserve Tibetan 
ancient manuscripts and woodblock prints.
    We also speak out very vocally, as you know, when we see 
the Chinese attempt to distort the history of the Uighurs and 
Tibetans, including ethnic Mongolians in Inner Mongolia. And I 
think the Mongolians see that, and I think they appreciate 
that. So I would hope to continue that conversation with my 
Mongolian counterparts, if confirmed, to help them, one, 
celebrate their rich history but, two, figure out ways where we 
can figure out how we can speak openly and candidly about what 
is going on in the PRC.
    Senator Hagerty. Excellent. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Senator Schatz. Senator Coons.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Chairman Schatz. Thank you to all 
of our nominees today for your long service to our nation and 
your dedication to foreign service. And thank you to your 
families for supporting you in this service and being such 
great partners with you.
    I have a broad number of questions and very little time, so 
I am going to focus, if I might, on a few areas of principal 
concern, just for me. Ambassador Godec, it is wonderful to see 
you again. Across a number of trips and engagements in Kenya 
and Ethiopia and elsewhere I am so impressed with your skills 
and your engagement and your capability. Thailand is a new 
region for you, a new engagement, and one where your deep 
experience, I think, will be critical and relevant.
    One of our core challenges, both in ASEAN and in Thailand 
and around the world in lots of different countries and 
contexts is balancing our interest in free expression, 
democracy, robust human rights in civil society, and security. 
How do you think we will balance our critical security 
relationship with Thailand with continuing to press for 
improvements in civil society and opening space for human 
rights advocates?
    Mr. Godec. Thank you, Senator Coons, and it is terrific to 
see you again as well.
    Senator, we do have obviously a number of interests with 
Thailand. We have a relationship that goes back almost two 
centuries, and across that time we have done a lot together, as 
I said in my opening statement. I do think we can do these 
things simultaneously. We can continue the security partnership 
which is so critical and at the same time be plain, privately, 
certainly, but public also when appropriate about things like 
the importance of continued progress on democracy, protection 
of human rights, fundamental freedoms.
    We can do these things, and I would certainly be deeply 
committed to doing that, in a wide range of ways. It starts by 
showing up. It was great to see the Secretary in Thailand just 
on Sunday. It was great to see the recent U.S.-ASEAN Special 
Summit the President hosted. It was great to see the other 
visitors, Secretary of Defense, out there just recently. But 
then it goes to, again, looking at really all of the different 
areas of the partnership, continuing the dialogue, and 
continuing to really emphasize where we can move forward 
together and where we have differences, making plain what those 
differences are and explaining why what we have to offer, I 
think, in terms of values is a good way to go.
    Senator Coons. Well, and I think sending a seasoned senior 
ambassador like yourself to help balance that tricky and 
challenging balance is exactly the right choice.
    Mr. Abraham, Yohannes, if I could, great to see you here. I 
am excited about your nomination to ASEAN. The Indo-Pacific 
Economic Framework, how do you plan to engage ASEAN on this 
opening towards trade integration that is not overturned in TPP 
but is an opportunity? How would you make progress on the IPEF?
    Mr. Abraham. Senator, thank you, and it is great to see you 
as well. I think first and foremost, as you do, the 
Administration believes that deepening our economic ties with 
the region, Indo-Pacific writ large and certainly within ASEAN, 
is critical to not only our economic prosperity but also our 
national security.
    If confirmed, I would look to work in close partnership 
with my colleagues in capitals around region to build on what 
we found to be a very encouraging initial set of countries who 
signed up to be a part of the launch of IPEF, seven members of 
ASEAN being amongst them.
    And so right now we are in a scoping stage of the exercise. 
As we continue to progress to build out IPEF I would look to be 
a partner with my colleagues in capitals around the region as 
well as in Washington, D.C.
    Senator Coons. Ms. Damour, I was pleased to see the 
initiative about new embassies in Kiribati and Tonga, the 
return of the Peace Corps to the region, establishment of a new 
USAID office in the region. If I might, with the forbearance of 
the Chairman, I would just like to ask each of the three 
remaining nominees if you might. I have particularly been 
interested in and supportive of the Development Finance 
Corporation and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. I am the 
Chair of the appropriating subcommittee that funds both of 
these.
    Could you just briefly explain how they will play a key 
role in the Pacific Islands, in our relationships in Mongolia, 
and in our relationships in Nepal, and how we might strengthen 
and deepen our partnerships in regions and countries where they 
have an alternative and we are trying to show up, as it were, 
and provide a meaningful partnership?
    Ms. Damour. Thank you for that, Senator, and thank you for 
your interest in the region. We do have one country amongst the 
five to which I have been nominated that has started a 
conversation with the MCC, as well as two countries that have 
signed an agreement with the Development Finance Corporation. 
And these are going to be critical because it will allow us to 
establish assistance to them that can help them with their 
sustainable economic development needs, which are vast, 
particularly in the area of infrastructure.
    One of the things, if confirmed, that I would look forward 
to doing is exploring how we can leverage those capabilities in 
order to demonstrate why the United States should be the 
preferred partner in assisting with their economic development.
    Senator Coons. Thank you. Mr. Buangan, in Mongolia?
    Mr. Buangan. Thank you, Senator, for that question. There 
are a couple of areas where I see the DFC and MCC helping with 
Mongolia, particularly through their infrastructure 
development. As I stated in my opening remarks, our largest 
investment right now is in the $350 million Millennium 
Challenge Corporation's grand to help Ulaanbaatar increase its 
water capacity. I think there is also a lot of opportunity that 
both of those programs are doing with respect to trade and 
investment, particularly improving Mongolia's investment 
climate, as we are seeing with DFC.
    And I think given the realities that Mongolia has, 
particularly with rooting out corruption, with strengthening 
its rule of law, I think those programs are also doing a lot to 
help strengthen capacity-building in those areas, where I think 
it would help, particularly as we are focusing on Mongolia's 
economic infrastructure and their economic development and 
their energy diversification, which I mentioned earlier, I 
think the whole-of-government approach here, DFC, MCC, 
including our public diplomacy and USAID programs will help 
strengthen those areas. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Mr. Chairman, your call. Do we have a moment 
for Nepal or should we move on?
    Senator Schatz. Sure.
    Senator Coons. Mr. Thompson.
    Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
We have talked a bit about the MCC already. It is a game-
changer, I believe, for Nepal. Five hundred million dollars 
will lead to thousands of jobs, tremendous infrastructure, 
connectivity for Nepal and India and the rest of the region. 
Tremendous transportation infrastructure upgrades for Nepal 
which can have great benefit on the trade front.
    DFC, a bit smaller still. It is more of a nascent stage 
there but a fantastic tool, we believe, to help provide the 
financing that is going to be necessary in so many areas, such 
as renewable energy, health care sector, and the growing 
technology sector there as well. So we look forward to seeing 
how we can better use that, and if confirmed, I would certainly 
be interested in doing that.
    Senator Coons. Thank you all very much. Thank you for your 
forbearance, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Schatz. Senator Markey.
    Senator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much.
    Mr. Abraham, in your testimony you spoke about the 
importance of human rights and standing up to universal values. 
My colleagues and I, we sent a letter to President Biden before 
the U.S.-ASEAN summit in May, urging the President to place 
democracy, good governance, and human rights as key items on 
the summit's agenda. I was disappointed that despite the 
importance the President said he will place on human rights and 
democracy in U.S. foreign policy these issues were marginalized 
during the summit.
    So if confirmed, what would you do to elevate the 
importance of human rights and concerns about democratic 
backsliding amongst ASEAN member countries?
    Mr. Abraham. Senator, thank you for the question, and I 
share your concerns around human rights and democratic 
backsliding in the region. If confirmed, first and foremost I 
will not hesitate to speak with interlocuters around the region 
about our human rights and/or governance concerns, in public 
and private fora. I would also work with the mission staff to 
ensure that U.S.-ASEAN missions tracking and monitoring 
capabilities as it relates to human rights concerns remain 
robust, and I would hope to work in close partnership with my 
colleagues, my bilateral colleagues in missions around the 
region on individual countries' concerns.
    Senator Markey. I am deeply concerned about the lack of 
progress in implementing the five-point consensus developed by 
ASEAN member countries, particularly with regard to engagement 
with all parties in Burma, including the National Unity 
Government. If confirmed, how would you engage with ASEAN to 
make progress in addressing the deteriorating human rights 
situation in Burma?
    Mr. Abraham. Senator, first and foremost, if confirmed, 
addressing really the horrifying and deteriorating situation in 
Burma would be a top priority of mine, and I would robustly 
push for the implementation of the five-points agenda and I 
would also look to work with colleagues around the government 
on what other tools we can bring to bear to change the regime's 
calculus and begin to move the country back towards a 
multiparty democracy. That would certainly be, and a way that 
has built on the Administration's use of the tools that 
Congress has granted them so far.
    Senator Markey. Okay. I want to stay with Burma and go to 
you, Ambassador Godec. Revenue from dirty fossil fuels 
continues to line the Burmese military's coffers. According to 
Human Rights Watch, Thailand's state-owned energy company, PTT, 
purchased about 80 percent of Burma's exported gas, repeatedly 
called for the United States to take a page out of the EU's 
playbook, and sanctioned the Myanmar oil and gas enterprise.
    Ambassador Godec, do you agree that we need to work with 
Thailand to reduce its reliance on natural gas from Burma and 
to reduce the Thai government's continued financial support of 
the Burmese military?
    Mr. Godec. Thank you for the question, Senator. I just want 
to emphasis as I did in my opening statement that the Burmese 
regime continues to carry out horrifying atrocities and it is 
critically important that this stop. We have supported ASEAN 
and the five-point consensus but there is not enough progress, 
clearly. In fact, there is no progress at all, and it needs to 
happen.
    We have worked with Thailand. Burma and the Burmese 
regime's horrifying actions have been a top issue in 
discussions with Thailand. Certainly the Secretary and many 
other officials have raised this. We are seeking ways with the 
Thai to increase the pressure on the Burmese regime. All 
options are on the table. That includes further action in the 
oil and gas sector. And, Senator, I would commit to working 
very hard on this matter, if confirmed. We appreciate some of 
the things that Thailand has done on the humanitarian side but 
clearly more pressure needs to be brought to bear and new 
ways----
    Senator Markey. It is all about oil and gas, everywhere on 
the planet. It is about the dough----
    Mr. Godec. It is a critical issue, Senator. I agree.
    Senator Markey.--with these authoritarian regimes, that 
they are able to extract from oil and gas, and then they do 
their evil deeds with that dough. So every time we see it we 
know what the answer should be, and if we take strong action 
then we will probably extract the results that we are looking 
for.
    And with that I will just ask my final question, over to 
Ms. Damour, and Fiji and the impact climate change is having 
upon Fiji and what actions we should be taking to assure them 
that we are on their side and will be there to help them.
    Ms. Damour. Thank you very much for the question, Senator, 
and thank you for focus on that region. The question of climate 
change, mitigating climate change is an existential issue for 
these nations. They are the most vulnerable around the world 
given their low-lying areas. The Biden-Harris administration 
has made it a top priority for addressing the region, 
mitigating the effects of climate change, assisting them with a 
clean energy transition. All of those, if confirmed, would be 
focus for me in terms of helping them.
    Senator Markey. Well, nothing more important because they 
are right in the crosshairs and we have to demonstrate that we 
understand their vulnerability and that we are going to take 
action. But we are going to show it to them specifically as 
well in terms of the help which we give them.
    So we thank you and we thank all of you. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield back.
    Senator Schatz. Senator Kaine.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and congratulations 
to the nominees. I note that three of you are Virginians and 
Virginia is proud of each of you.
    Mr. Godec, in particular, I want to commend you in your 
current role, the work that you have done with Afghan refugee 
resettlement at the State Department. I do not think we give it 
enough attention here that in 90 days the United States helped 
126,000 people come out of Afghanistan, about 50,000 to other 
nations, 76,000 to the United States. Virtually all of them 
came into Virginia at Dulles Airport. They were then assigned 
to one of eight military bases for processing, three of which 
were in Virginia. As of February, all of those bases were 
closed and the 76,000 in the United States were now in 
communities, supported by families, supported by churches and 
other nonprofit groups all over the United States.
    I do not think that story has been told enough. I have 
suggested before that I think it would be a good idea for this 
committee to talk about the--you know, get an update on the 
status of these 76,000 as well as the 50,000 who we helped 
evacuate to third countries. We do know there are others in 
Afghanistan who continue to want to come to the United States, 
and I think that would also be an appropriate topic to delve 
into, what more we can do about that.
    But just that number, 126,000 in 90 days, by order of 
comparison in the aftermath of the Vietnam War it took months 
and years to bring 120,000 Vietnamese to the United States. In 
the aftermath of World War II we brought about 65,000 displaced 
people from Europe, primarily Jewish Europeans, to the United 
States. That took 5 years to bring 75,000 European Jews to the 
United States in the aftermath of World War II. The fact that 
you and your colleagues and this administration was able to 
help 76,000 Afghans begin a new chapter of life here, and 
another 50,000 in other countries where they would be safer 
than Afghanistan is worthy of some attention, and I hope we 
might do that.
    Mr. Abraham, I want to ask you a question. It is good to 
see you again. I want to ask you a question about ASEAN. Four 
of the 10 ASEAN nations have border disputes with China. So as 
somebody who does not consider myself an expert in the region I 
look at that as, that is interesting. So what does that fact 
say about prospects for deeper and deeper U.S. engagement with 
the ASEAN nations?
    Mr. Abraham. Senator, thank you for the question. I think 
my reflection on that fact is that it is a national security 
interest of ours to build the capacity of ASEAN as an 
institution to allow the nations of ASEAN to speak 
collectively, in a unified way, and importantly have the tools 
at their disposal to act on their self-interests. There are any 
number of those interests. You touch on territorial integrity 
and the issues of sovereignty. We are certainly committed to, 
and if confirmed, I would be committed to ensuring that ASEAN 
has the institutional capacity and that we are encouraging of 
their ability to collectively, and collectivize some of their 
concerns in a way that would put them in the driver's seat in 
dealing with bigger countries in the region like the PRC.
    Senator Kaine. The border disputes are largely in the South 
China Sea, and the U.S. is sort of committing a self-inflicted 
wound by not eventually ratifying the U.N. Convention on the 
law of the sea. If the U.S. ratified that treaty, as every 
Secretary of Defense and every Secretary of State for the last 
decade has suggested we do, then we would have standing to help 
in pressing claims about border disputes in that area. We now 
do not have standing because of our refusal, which is amazing 
to me, our refusal to ratify that treaty. It is my hope that 
colleagues would eventually wake up to the need to do that.
    Let me ask you this. Senator Markey asked you about Burma 
and what you might do, obviously, to deal with the very, very 
difficult situation there. Secretary Blinken recently had some 
tough words for ASEAN, feeling like ASEAN had not really done 
enough. They have done some. Individual leaders have done some 
things. They have blocked Burmese leadership from attending 
ASEAN meetings on occasion.
    But as you look at what ASEAN could do to be more effective 
in Burma, talk about that a little bit.
    Mr. Abraham. Senator, thank you for the question. I would 
view our engagement with ASEAN as part of a larger whole of 
trying to effect change on the situation in Burma. I think our 
work with ASEAN would be an important part of that. I think 
building on the floor that was set, to your point about the 
precedent that was set about nonpolitical representation of 
Burma at key ASEAN meetings is an important floor that we need 
to build on and build from.
    I would view myself as part of a broader team, a 
multilateral component of a broader team that is really aimed 
at changing the regime's calculus. Some of that work will be 
done in bilateral context, and if I was confirmed, I would 
happily and enthusiastically work bilaterally or in small 
groupings in Jakarta with representatives from other ASEAN 
nations on which in which we can continue to change the 
regime's calculus and continue to build an echo chamber around 
the costs that we have exacted on the regime.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chair.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Senator Kaine. If there are no 
more questions for the witnesses the record will remain open 
until close of business Thursday, July 14, for questions for 
the record. We urge our nominees to complete those answers as 
rapidly and as thoroughly as possible so that we can clear for 
committee action your nominations. Each of you will have 
critical positions that we need confirmed, so we would urge you 
to try to complete this work as quickly as possible.
    If there is no further business the committee stands 
adjourned.


    [Whereupon, at 11:34 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
           to Hon. Robert F. Godec by Senator Robert Menendez

    Question. How should the US balance our concerns about Thailand's 
democratic backsliding with our security commitments and cooperation to 
the country? Given the Government crackdown on protesters, do you think 
all military exercises, including the large-scale Cobra Gold exercises, 
should continue as usual?

    Answer. The United States and Thailand are longstanding allies. We 
have extensive cooperation on security, which has been important for 
both our countries and the region. Promoting respect for human rights 
and democracy are also indispensable elements of our foreign policy 
that advance our strategic interests. Our security assistance programs 
include human rights training and associated institutional capacity 
building and, I believe, the more we engage with Thailand on security 
issues, the more we are promoting respect for human rights in the 
military and police.
    If confirmed, I would engage with the Thai Government, civil 
society, and other parts of Thai society on how we can best achieve our 
human rights and democracy objectives and our security assistance 
objectives to promote the broader interests of the United States. I 
believe we can successfully pursue all our goals.

    Question. How, if confirmed, do you plan on raising the issues of 
the arrested pro-democracy protest leaders with the Thai Government? 
What leverage does the United States have to encourage greater respect 
for human rights in Thailand?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will prioritize with the Thai Government 
the importance of further progress on democracy and respect for human 
rights, including the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of 
peaceful assembly.
    In the recently signed United States-Thailand Communique on 
Strategic Alliance and Partnership, the Thai Government affirmed strong 
democratic institutions, independent civil society, and free and fair 
elections are central to our shared vision. As I have done in my other 
assignments, I would engage both privately and, when appropriate, 
publicly on these issues. I would also encourage senior U.S. Government 
leaders, congressional visitors, and others to do so, as well. I 
believe our continued engagement with Thailand across the broad range 
of our shared interests will help influence and encourage further 
progress in Thailand.

    Question. If you are confirmed, what role will Thailand's relations 
with Burma play in your engagement with their leadership?

    Answer. The escalating crisis in Burma is horrifying, and the 
United States has continued to urge others to take strong actions in 
response to the military coup and the regime's abhorrent crackdown on 
the people of Burma. If confirmed, I would continue to prioritize 
engagement with the Thai Government on Burma. I would further press 
Thailand to hold the military regime accountable to the full and swift 
implementation of the ASEAN Five-Point consensus.
    If confirmed, I would also prioritize increasing humanitarian 
assistance to the people of Burma. I want to work with Thailand to 
expand existing assistance efforts to better address the ongoing the 
crisis in Burma and the delivery of unhindered humanitarian aid, 
including through cross-border mechanisms.

    Question. What are the key challenges Thailand faces in addressing 
trafficking in persons, including in the fishing industry and sex 
trafficking of women and children? How, if at all, has the COVID-19 
pandemic affected the Government's anti-trafficking efforts?

    Answer. The downgrade in 2021 of Thailand's Trafficking in Persons 
Report ranking reflected the challenges Thailand has faced in 
adequately addressing this serious problem. The Thai Government has 
prioritized making improvements in its anti-trafficking efforts and, if 
confirmed, I will work to find avenues of cooperation to support these 
efforts.
    Thailand's key challenges have been in investigating and 
prosecuting offenders, particularly for labor trafficking. Although 
Thailand has made efforts to improve labor inspections, the Government 
still faces challenges identifying traffickers--particularly in the 
fishing industry. During the pandemic, the Government and NGOs saw an 
increase in online sexual exploitation, especially of children.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
           to Hon. Robert F. Godec by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 Trafficking in Persons 
Report, Thailand was downgraded to the Tier 2 Watch List for not fully 
meeting the minimum standards to eliminate trafficking including by 
initiating fewer investigations, and prosecuting and convicting fewer 
traffickers. How will you work with the Thai Government to address 
these issues if you are confirmed as Ambassador?

    Answer. Thailand's downgraded ranking in the 2021 Trafficking in 
Persons Report reflected the challenges the country has encountered in 
adequately addressing this serious problem. The Thai Government has 
reported it continues to prioritize making improvements in its anti-
trafficking efforts and, if confirmed, I will work to find avenues of 
cooperation to support these efforts.
    Working with our interagency team at Embassy Bangkok, I will seek 
specific ways to support anti-trafficking goals. For example, both 
publicly and privately, I will promote the improvement of the capacity 
of local law enforcement to investigate and prosecute offenders--
especially labor traffickers. The Thai Government has publicly stated 
its desire to improve its anti-trafficking efforts and, if confirmed, I 
plan to leverage this political will and work closely with the Thai 
Government to achieve our shared goals of protecting victims and 
bringing traffickers to justice.

    Question. The Office of to Monitor and Combat trafficking in 
persons plays a key role in assisting Ambassadors in promoting anti-
trafficking work. Please describe how you can work with the office to 
improve Thailand's anti-trafficking work in country.

    Answer. I deeply value the work done by the Office to Monitor and 
Combat Trafficking in Persons and plan to coordinate closely with them 
to improve anti-trafficking efforts in Thailand. Specifically, if 
confirmed, I would welcome the opportunity to host officials from the 
TIP Office in Bangkok, in order to facilitate candid engagements with 
the Thai Government and civil society on ways to combat trafficking. 
Throughout my career, I have found that such visits foster 
relationships across governments and people and help build common 
understanding of the causes and potential solutions for issues such as 
trafficking in persons.

    Question. What concrete steps can you, if confirmed, take with your 
mission to help Thailand improve its anti-trafficking efforts?

    Answer. Some of Thailand's key challenges have centered around its 
efforts to provide adequate services to victims and to address labor 
trafficking. Although Thailand has made efforts to improve labor 
inspections, the Government still faces challenges identifying labor 
trafficking victims and their traffickers--including in the fishing 
industry. If confirmed, I will lead the mission's efforts to work with 
the Thai Government, civil society, and other partners to focus on 
areas where Thailand must improve.
    I also hope to build on existing programming such as USAID's 
Counter Trafficking in Persons Program in Thailand to address the 
demands and incentives for using forced labor, among other goals. 
Mission Thailand includes dozens of U.S. agencies and offices and I 
plan to leverage that talent and expertise to bring a whole-of-mission 
approach to combat trafficking in Thailand.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, tensions between religious groups remains in Thailand, 
particularly in the Deep South, which has resulted in at least 86 
deaths of both Muslims and Buddhists. What is your assessment of this 
particular issue and if confirmed, how will you work with the 
Ambassador-at-Large to bolster religious freedom in-country?

    Answer. As Secretary Blinken has stated, the United States 
maintains its unwavering support to promote respect for and protect 
freedom of religion or belief for all. I understand that Mission 
Thailand regularly engages with the Thai Government, civil society, and 
Thais of all religious backgrounds to promote respect for the freedom 
of religion or belief. Mission Thailand has made outreach to the Deep 
South a priority, supporting projects on digital literacy, diversity 
and inclusion, youth engagement, and community building. If confirmed, 
I commit to continuing these important engagements, and I would work 
with the Ambassador-at-Large to explore new ways to further support 
religious freedom in Thailand.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 Human Rights Report, 
Thailand was noted as having several significant human rights abuses, 
including credible reports of torture, cruel and inhuman treatment by 
government officials and arbitrary arrests. Additionally, there are 
reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, association, 
and movement. If confirmed, what steps will you take to continue to 
address these instances with the host government?

    Answer. Promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms and 
advancing democratic values are among my highest priorities, including 
as part of advancing our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. If 
confirmed, I will ensure these priorities continue to be elevated in 
meetings and engagements with the Thai Government at all levels and 
remain a central focus of the bilateral relationship. I will encourage 
the Thai Government to respect freedoms of expression, association, and 
movement and encourage Thailand to review and revise or repeal laws 
used to unduly restrict any of these freedoms. Thailand's continued 
progress to uphold democratic institutions, and human rights, including 
freedom of expression, is essential to our partnership as was reflected 
in the recently signed United States-Thailand Communique on Strategic 
Alliance and Partnership.

    Question. How will you direct your Embassy to work with civil 
society organizations to improve the human rights situation on the 
ground?

    Answer. Throughout my career, I have prioritized engagement with 
and support for civil society. The United States places great 
importance on civil society and NGOs and, if confirmed, I will continue 
our strong advocacy both publicly and privately in support of the 
critical role played by civil society in Thailand's democratic 
development and promotion of human rights. If confirmed, I would work 
to advance American values and respect for human rights in my 
engagements at all levels of the Thai Government and with all parts of 
Thai society and would ask all members of Mission Thailand to take the 
same approach.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to personally raising human 
rights issues with the Thai Government?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will not hesitate to raise human 
rights issues with all levels of the Thai Government. As allies and 
partners, the United States and Thailand have a productive platform 
with which to engage candidly. I firmly believe that the promotion of 
human rights is in the interest of all people in the United States and 
Thailand, and I will work tirelessly in support of that goal. If 
confirmed, in addition to raising human rights issues with the Thai 
Government, I look forward to meeting regularly with human rights 
advocates, civil society, and other non-governmental organizations in 
Thailand to affirm U.S. support for human rights.

    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Bangkok?

    Answer. Mission Thailand is one of the largest in the world and 
high morale is essential to its success. Like many other missions 
around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic created challenges for the 
staff and for families. I understand the current mission leadership has 
worked hard and effectively to address these concerns and the recent 
lifting of some restrictions by the Thai Government and improvement in 
the overall public health situation has helped. If confirmed, I would 
work with the DCM and others in the mission to bolster morale further 
and ensure all staff and families have sense of safety and security.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Bangkok?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would place a high priority on mission 
morale and actively seek opportunities to improve it. As I indicated in 
my statement at my hearing, I would prioritize the safety and security 
of mission staff and families and work to ensure the team has the 
resources needed to succeed in advancing our goals. I would draw from 
my experiences at Embassy Nairobi and Embassy Tunis to improve morale 
and foster a strong community life, always seeking to innovate. I would 
work with the DCM and use an inclusive style, consulting and speaking 
frequently with staff to solicit ideas and share views on how to build 
morale. I would support staff development with an interagency 
mentorship program and seek staff input through regular anonymous 
morale surveys (to include on the performance of the Ambassador and 
DCM).

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Bangkok?

    Answer. As I have done in my previous service as Ambassador, if 
confirmed, I would start by listening to our country team and other 
personnel in Thailand to ensure I fully understand our current 
objectives and programs. I would consult with them to establish a clear 
vision and set of goals and objectives. I would work to communicate 
those goals throughout the Mission and more widely in the U.S. 
Government. I would also create a strong interagency working group 
system to monitor and facilitate implementation.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I believe in an inclusive, open, and collaborative 
leadership and management style. I seek the views of the widest 
possible range of staff and to build a team. I work with the entire 
team to create a vision, set goals, and implement them. I communicate 
clearly and candidly and ask that everyone else do so as well. I seek 
to decentralize decision-making and empower employees to own and direct 
their work and activities consistent with U.S. law and administration 
policy.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No. It is never acceptable or constructive to berate 
subordinates either in public or private.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would ask my Deputy Chief of Mission to 
serve as the Embassy's chief operating officer. I would regularly seek 
the DCM's views on the full range of leadership, management, and policy 
issues the mission faces and keep the DCM informed of my actions, 
activities, and decisions.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. As a former ambassador, I understand that the ambassador-
Deputy Chief of Mission relationship is critical to a well-functioning 
mission. In my previous assignments, I have empowered my DCM to serve 
as the Embassy's chief operating officer and would do so as well in 
Thailand, if confirmed. I would regularly seek the DCM's counsel to 
ensure effective Embassy operations to enable the team to meet our 
strategic objectives and implement our policies and programs. I would 
also ensure the DCM is fully informed of and consulted on all mission 
policies and activities and is prepared to become Charge d'Affaires 
when necessary.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking. Do 
you believe that it is important to provide employees with accurate, 
constructive feedback on their performances in order to encourage 
improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their roles?

    Answer. Yes, it is important to provide employees with accurate, 
constructive feedback on their performances to encourage improvement 
and reward those who succeed in their work. If confirmed, I commit to 
doing both.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes, I would support and encourage clear, accurate, and 
direct feedback to employees in order to improve performance and reward 
high achievers. If confirmed, I commit to doing so.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Thailand. In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our Embassy 
walls enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. In recent years, security concerns and now the COVID-19 
pandemic have limited the engagement of U.S. diplomats in Thailand and 
other countries. As Secretary Blinken has emphasized, however, 
``diplomacy is a contact sport.'' I believe it is essential that we 
actively reach out to speak and engage with the Thai people in all 
walks of life. We must get out of the Embassy and into the communities 
if we are to be effective diplomats.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would work with the Embassy Bangkok and 
Consulate General Chiang Mai Public Affairs Sections and with the full 
country team to find ways to engage with people across Thailand. We 
would do so through many channels (e.g., events, digital and 
traditional media, and other available mechanisms) to advance U.S. 
goals. I would work to ensure that all members of the Mission Thailand 
team are involved in this outreach and make it a priority.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in 
Thailand?

    Answer. With its rich culture and traditions and 200 years of 
friendship with the United States, I understand Thailand is a vibrant 
environment for public diplomacy. Additionally, the United States and 
Thailand enjoy robust people-to-people connections creating the 
foundation for expansive public diplomacy and outreach. For many years, 
the United States has supported cultural exchange with Thailand through 
highly successful programs like the Fulbright program, Young Southeast 
Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI), and the United States' International 
Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP). If confirmed, I hope to build on 
these programs to create lasting connections between the next 
generations of our countries.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. Disinformation, competition in the information and 
programming space, and personnel constraints present public diplomacy 
challenges in Thailand. If confirmed, I commit to working to increase 
public diplomacy resources to expand our messaging and programmatic 
efforts. I will use my platform as Ambassador to accurately inform 
target Thai audiences about our policy priorities and range of 
bilateral cooperation to build support for our shared goals. I also 
believe in supporting local efforts to counter disinformation, 
including by building journalistic capacity, increasing fact-checking 
and providing training to combat mis- and disinformation.
    Although the COVID-19 pandemic limited in-person public diplomacy 
programming in Thailand during the past two years, if confirmed, I hope 
to return to and even exceed pre-pandemic levels of in-person public 
diplomacy engagement across Thailand and to continue using new virtual 
tools to expand our reach and strengthen people-to-people ties.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the talented team of 
diplomats and local staff at Mission Thailand to understand and support 
the mission's unique role in formulating public diplomacy programs and 
responses, especially those tailored to local audiences. I would draw 
on local expertise and insights, gleaned from organizations like the 
new Thailand-U.S. Alumni Association and the Embassy Youth Council, to 
ensure our public diplomacy messages are appropriately calibrated for 
the local audience and that they explain and advance our key foreign 
policy priorities. I would do this while consistently promoting the 
American values that underscore our public diplomacy around the world. 
I would also coordinate with and keep Main State informed of our 
messages and draw on their capabilities as appropriate.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel. The past occurrences and ongoing threat of anomalous 
health incidents among Embassy personnel and their families poses a 
serious challenge to morale. When personnel at post fear for their 
safety or doubt that their case will be taken seriously if they were 
affected, the performance of Embassy operations can suffer.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes. I am deeply troubled by potential anomalous health 
incidents that have affected Embassy personnel and their family 
members. I agree we must take these reported incidents seriously and, 
if confirmed, I would absolutely do so in my role as leader of Mission 
Thailand. If confirmed, the health, safety, and security of Embassy 
staff, their family members, and all those supporting Mission Thailand 
will be my highest priority.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Bangkok personnel?

    Answer. If confirmed, I am committed to sharing information on this 
issue consistent with ensuring the integrity of ongoing investigations. 
If confirmed, I will do everything in my power to protect the health 
and safety of our mission team members and their families.

    Question. Have you received a briefing on the anomalous health 
incidents that have occurred to U.S. Government personnel around the 
world, including at U.S. embassies and other diplomatic posts? If you 
have not, and if you are confirmed, do you commit to receiving a 
briefing on the incidents before you depart for your post?

    Answer. If confirmed, it will be my highest priority to protect the 
health and safety of our mission staff and their families. I will 
commit to receive any available briefings, unclassified and classified, 
and will seek further information in meetings with the Coordinator of 
the State Department's Health Incident Response Task Force as well as 
relevant bureaus including Diplomatic Security and Intelligence and 
Research.

    Question. In the event of an anomalous health incident among your 
Embassy personnel or eligible family members, do you commit to maintain 
detailed records of the incident, and share the information with the 
State Department and other embassies to contribute to the investigation 
of how these attacks are affecting U.S. missions and personnel around 
the world?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I commit to supporting investigations 
into circumstances surrounding the anomalous health incidents and to 
maintaining records and sharing information.
    I commit to working with the State Department to ensure the safety 
and security of Mission Thailand staff and their families and all U.S. 
citizens.

    Question. Whether or not anomalous health incidents occur at your 
Embassy, how will you work to restore and preserve morale that may be 
lost due to the knowledge these attacks have been occurring at posts 
around the world?

    Answer. If confirmed, in the event of any health emergency, I would 
prioritize the health and safety of our diplomats and their family 
members and ensure that those impacted receive the proper treatment. To 
help preserve and restore morale, I would communicate clearly, 
transparently, and honestly with my staff about this issue and more 
generally in my work every day.
    I also commit to an open-door policy and would welcome my staff 
speaking with me about any issue, including those potentially affecting 
the health of mission members. I also commit to speaking with my staff 
regularly about the mission's goals to ensure they understand the role 
of their individual work in achieving our overall objectives on behalf 
of the U.S. Government and the American people.



                               __________


       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
             to Hon. Robert F. Godec by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. Thailand is the oldest of the United States' five treaty 
allies in the Indo-Pacific, with our cooperation going back to World 
War II and the Korean War. Despite our robust security relationship, 
Thailand has become closer to the CCP. The PRC is increasingly becoming 
Thailand's largest trading partner, and Thailand declined to join 
regional trade agreements sponsored by our allies, like the Trans-
Pacific Partnership, that exclude the PRC. The current Thai Government, 
led by the same leader that overthrew a democratically elected 
government in 2014, also finds the CCP a more convenient partner that 
will not criticize its human rights abuses against protesters. This 
seems to indicate that Thailand will only become closer to the CCP.

   In your view, what are the prospects for reversing this apparent 
        pro-CCP trend in Thailand's foreign policy?

    Answer. The U.S.-Thailand alliance is critical for both the United 
States and Thailand. It is central to the security and prosperity of 
the region, and it is widely welcomed in Thailand. If confirmed, I 
would engage with the Thai Government and all parts of Thai society to 
build understanding of the PRC's actions to ensure that China plays by 
the same rules as everyone else. If confirmed, I look forward to 
supporting and growing this relationship.
    For example, for more than two hundred years, the United States and 
Thailand have enjoyed a close trade relationship, and Thailand has 
joined the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). The United States is 
also Thailand's largest export market. If confirmed, I look forward to 
working with Thailand to ensure the IPEF deepens our economic relations 
in the region and coordinates approaches to global economic challenges. 
I believe Thailand's engagement in the IPEF process is indicative of 
the deep economic ties between our nations, and its importance as a 
friend and ally. The depth and importance of our ties in many areas 
including economic, will, I believe, create opportunities for progress 
on the challenge posed by the PRC.

    Question. Is a pro-CCP Thailand a threat to U.S. interests? Please 
explain.

    Answer. If confirmed, I will encourage Thailand to continue to 
proactively raise concerns over PRC actions that undermine the rules-
based international order. I will also encourage regular communication 
and coordination with Thailand to address common security, economic, 
and environmental concerns, such as the PRC's increasingly provocative 
activities in the South China Sea and at Ream Naval Base in Cambodia 
and transboundary water management along the Mekong River.
    The United States and Thailand maintain strong economic relations. 
The United States is Thailand's largest export market and has more than 
double the investment in Thailand as that of the PRC.

    Question. Does the Chinese Communist Party pose a threat to the 
United States? Please explain.

    Answer. As Secretary Blinken said in May, we believe the PRC is the 
one country that increasingly has the economic, technological, 
military, and diplomatic means to advance a different vision of 
international order. Beijing's actions suggest PRC officials intend to 
do so.

    Question. We are prepared to work together with Beijing where our 
interests intersect, where it is essential for global peace and 
prosperity and to keep lines of communication open. There is no reason 
why our great nations cannot coexist peacefully. As Secretary Blinken 
said, we will compete with confidence; we will cooperate wherever we 
can; we will contest where we must.

   If confirmed, how will you accomplish this?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue to strengthen ties between 
the United States and Thailand by building on the existing links that 
bridge our countries across society. We have close security, economic, 
people-to-people, business-to-business, and many other cultural ties 
that have developed during the past two centuries. The recently signed 
United States-Thailand Communique on Strategic Alliance and Partnership 
reaffirms the breadth and depth of U.S.-Thai bilateral relations and, 
if confirmed, I plan to work to continue to strengthen those ties.

    Question. Do wedges exist between the CCP and the current Thai 
Government?

    Answer. Thailand maintains robust relationships with both the 
United States and PRC. Thailand shares our concerns about the PRC's 
behavior in the region, yet, like the United States, also has economic 
ties to Beijing and areas where Thailand and PRC cooperate.
    Thailand has raised concerns when PRC activities affect the well-
being of Thai citizens. For example, Thailand pushed back when PRC 
activities on upper parts of the Mekong River--such as damming and 
blasting the river--threatened the livelihoods of Thai communities 
downstream. If confirmed, I will support Thailand when faced by 
provocative PRC behavior that undermines Thai and U.S. interests alike.

    Question. Are there pro-American factions in the Thai Government? 
If so, how can we best empower them?

    Answer. The United States and Thailand enjoy almost two hundred 
years of close ties. Over that time, we have built a rich web of 
relationships running through all aspects of society. In addition to 
our security alliance, Thailand relies on the United States 
economically as its top export destination. Furthermore, our 
connections are enriched by the presence in the United States of almost 
350,000 Thais and U.S. citizens of Thai heritage, and by the more than 
100,000 U.S. citizens in Thailand.
    U.S. cultural exchange programs further foster good relationships 
between our countries and many Thai leaders have participated in those 
programs. If confirmed, I will continue these people-to-people 
exchanges and fund more programs to create these lasting connections 
between our two countries.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to support Thailand in 
maintaining its positive relations with the U.S.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will build on the existing strong ties 
between the United States and Thailand and identify new areas to grow 
our relationship. I will foster new areas of cooperation like space, 
climate, and cyber security. At its foundation, the United States-
Thailand relationship is built on strong people-to-people ties, and I 
will seek ways to further expand these ties to reach younger 
generations of Thai and American people.

    Question. The Trump and Biden Administrations have worked towards 
forming new, pro-U.S. groupings in the Indo-Pacific, including the Quad 
and the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) agreement. These 
groupings exclude Thailand and other treaty allies, like the 
Philippines and Korea.

   Is there an avenue for Thailand and other treaty allies to engage 
        with the Quad or AUKUS?

    Answer. Thailand has deep and strong relationships with each of the 
countries in the Quad and AUKUS. These relationships span a wide range, 
including economic and security dimensions. I believe Thailand would be 
open to considering engagements with the Quad and AUKUS in areas of 
mutual interest. As one example, the Quad countries' Chiefs of Mission 
in Bangkok jointly handed over to the Thai Ministry of Health Indian 
produced COVID-19 vaccines as part of the Quad's Vaccine Partnership.
    If confirmed, I will engage regularly with the Chiefs of Mission of 
these allies and partners and find ways to advance our mutual interests 
to the benefit of Thailand, other allies, and the Indo-Pacific as a 
whole.

    Question. What is your view of Thailand's attitude to these new 
groupings? Do they see it as an opportunity to enhance relations with 
the U.S.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to engaging with the countries of 
the Quad and AUKUS and with Thailand to effectively convey the goals of 
these groupings. I believe the United States would benefit from 
promoting the new groupings with key allies and partners in the Indo-
Pacific region like Thailand.
    Thailand has deep and strong relationships with each of the 
countries in the Quad and AUKUS. These relationships span a wide range, 
including economic and security dimensions. I believe Thailand would be 
open to considering engagements with the Quad and AUKUS in areas of 
mutual interest. If confirmed, I will seek opportunities to build such 
engagements.

    Question. If confirmed, what activities would you recommend to 
encourage Thai engagement with the Quad or AUKUS?

    Answer. Throughout my career, I have engaged with Chiefs of Mission 
of like-minded countries to promote U.S. interests abroad. If 
confirmed, I will use my position as U.S. Ambassador to convene 
diplomatic gatherings to explain our Indo-Pacific strategy and how 
groupings like the Quad or AUKUS--as well as ASEAN--share U.S. goals 
for prosperity, stability, and security in the region.

    Question. Thailand has struggled to maintain its historical respect 
for universal human rights in recent years. From often violent 
suppressions of opposition protests to widespread allegations of forced 
labor in its fishing industry, the Thai Government is increasingly 
adopting positions that have led Congress to impose sanctions on other 
countries. Left unaddressed, these issues can lead the Thai population 
to question the legitimacy of Thai democracy--which would be a boon to 
the CCP, which is eager to promote its authoritarian system.

   What levers does the United States have to encourage the Thai 
        Government to be more responsive to allegations of human rights 
        abuses?

    Answer. Strengthening democracy and promoting respect for human 
rights and the rule of law is fundamental to U.S. relations with 
Thailand. Our alliance and partnership with Thailand is foundational to 
the U.S. role in the Indo Pacific, and the relationship is built on 
shared values and principles founded upon mutual democratic 
aspirations. The recently signed United States-Thailand Communique on 
Strategic Alliance and Partnership reaffirms a mutual respect for 
strong democratic institutions, independent civil society, and free and 
fair elections as central to our shared vision. If confirmed, I will 
prioritize these themes in my engagement with the Thai Government and 
wider Thai society.

    Question. In your opinion, do you see evidence that the CCP 
encourages or enhances these abuses?

    Answer. The United States welcomes contributions by the People's 
Republic of China to regional development, so long as it adheres to 
high standards, including in areas such as transparency, the rule of 
law, absence of corruption, environmental protection, human rights and 
labor rights, sustainable financing, and respect for the autonomy of 
development aid recipients.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to encourage Thailand to 
maintain its historic commitment to human rights and democracy?

    Answer. The United States and Thailand expressed our shared respect 
for human rights and democracy through the United States-Thailand 
Communique on Strategic Alliance and Partnership. If confirmed, I will 
work with Thailand to uphold its commitment to human rights and 
democracy, the foundation of our alliance and partnership. Furthermore, 
I will reiterate how critical human rights and democracy are to 
ensuring security and prosperity for all people. To do so, I will 
engage with the Thai Government and with the wider Thai society, 
including civil society groups, independent media, and human rights 
activists.

            to Hon. Robert F. Godec by Senator John Barrasso

    Question. Humanitarian assistance has been deteriorating in Burma 
since the February 2021 coup d'etat. The delivery of humanitarian 
assistance, COVID-19 vaccines, and other aid has continued to be 
limited. What percentage of the population in Burma and Thailand have 
been vaccinated for COVID-19?

    Answer. The crisis in Burma continues to worsen. While Thailand has 
provided humanitarian assistance to people fleeing Burma since the 2021 
military coup, far more work needs to be done to meet the growing needs 
of the people of Burma. If confirmed, I will work closely with Thailand 
and other countries in the region to advocate for humanitarian access 
and expand humanitarian assistance and access to meet the needs of all 
people displaced in and from Burma, including via cross-border 
mechanisms.
    As of July 12, more than 80 percent of Thais had received one 
vaccine dose and more than 76 percent of Thais had received two doses.

    Question. What is the status of the effort to establish a Thai-
Burma cross border program on getting coronavirus vaccines into Burma?

    Answer. We continue to work with Thailand and other neighboring 
countries to seek additional ways to deliver critical assistance to the 
people of Burma, including through facilitating cross-border vaccines 
and other humanitarian assistance. Secretary Blinken, Deputy Secretary 
Sherman, U.S.-U.N. Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield, and Counselor Chollet 
have pressed the importance of providing assistance to the people of 
Burma during visits to Thailand and other parts of the region.
    Thailand has also joined the COVID-19 Global Action Plan, under 
which countries are working together to accelerate access to vaccines 
in all settings, including humanitarian. In March, Thailand donated 
500,000 doses of Astra-Zeneca vaccine to Burma, along with 3 million 
doses to other countries in the region.
    Sadly, the greatest obstacle to providing life-saving vaccines to 
the people of Burma is the Burmese military regime. If confirmed, I 
will work with Thailand and other ASEAN countries to press the regime 
to allow for greater access to vaccines and humanitarian assistance.

    Question. What are the political and diplomatic challenges in 
getting coronavirus vaccinations into Burma?

    Answer. Since the February 2021 coup d'etat, the Burmese military 
regime has continued to impede the delivery of humanitarian assistance, 
including medical aid, to the people of Burma. The United States has 
continued to urge ASEAN as a collective, ASEAN member states, and other 
partners to press the regime to allow unhindered humanitarian access 
and the delivery of aid, including COVID-19 vaccinations, to all those 
in need, including in remote areas of the country. If confirmed, I will 
continue to work closely with the Thai Government to in support of the 
equitable delivery of COVID-19 vaccine doses and other assistance to 
the people of Burma.

    Question. If confirmed, what actions will you take to aid in 
getting vaccines and other humanitarian assistance into Burma?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will commit to working with the Thai 
Government, like-minded countries, regional partners, civil society 
organizations, NGOs, and international organizations to provide COVID-
19 vaccines and other humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma. I 
will encourage Thailand to increase pressure on the regime to swiftly 
and fully implement ASEAN's Five-Point Consensus, cease the violence, 
release all those unjustly detained, allow unhindered humanitarian 
access to those affected in Burma, and restore Burma's path to 
inclusive democracy.
    Recognizing Thailand's long tradition of supporting Burmese 
refugees, if confirmed, I will seek ways to expand assistance to people 
from Burma in need, including those suffering as a result of the 
military coup and subsequent regime violence and repression. I will 
regularly meet with like-minded partners and ASEAN member states to 
advocate they speak with one voice and coordinate resources to help end 
the violence in Burma and return the country to the path toward 
democracy.

    Question. During a briefing on April 26, 2021, you said, ``We are 
very much committed to working together with Africans to overcome the 
COVID-19 pandemic, to promote trade and investment, to strengthen 
security, to tackle the climate crisis, to advance democracy, human 
rights, the rule of law, and to work again together on a whole range of 
issues that matter to both Africans and Americans.''
    Again, in your testimony you said, ``We welcome Thailand's 
commitment to address the threat of climate change; this will be a 
critical area for further collaboration.''

   As Ambassador, do you plan to focus on and promote climate change? 
        If so, what would be your priorities?

    Answer. Climate change is a major concern for both the United 
States and Thailand. If confirmed, it would be a top priority for me. I 
would continue our engagement with the Royal Thai Government on clean 
energy and climate, including through the Agriculture Innovation 
Mission for Climate, the Sustainable Partnerships for Growth, the 
Global Methane Pledge, the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and 
Land Use, USAID's Corporate Clean Energy Alliance, and the Greening 
Government Initiative. We will also work with Thailand to enhance their 
resilience to the impacts of climate change through the President's 
Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience.
    The United States is supporting Thailand's climate ambitions 
through a range of engagements, including USAID's SERVIR-Mekong 
program, USTDA's Global Partnership for Climate Smart Infrastructure 
Initiative, and a number of State Department programs including the 
Mekong Water Data Initiative, the Water Smart Engagements program, and 
the Japan-U.S. Mekong Power Partnership. Thailand was also the first 
country in the world to sign the U.S.-led Clean Energy Demand 
Initiative.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to making Thailand's response 
to the coup in Burma a priority of your diplomacy?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I would engage Thailand to underscore 
the importance that all countries, including Thailand, strongly condemn 
the military coup and violence in Burma and press the Burmese military 
to end its horrific violence, which has led to worsening political, 
human rights, and humanitarian crises. I would work closely with 
Thailand and other countries in the region to advocate for unhindered 
humanitarian access and expand humanitarian assistance to meet the 
needs of all people displaced in and from Burma, including via cross-
border mechanisms.

    Question. What steps can the United States take in our diplomacy 
with Thailand that would incentivize them to take a more active role in 
mediating a return to democracy in Burma?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would work closely with Thailand, and other 
allies and regional partners, to strengthen diplomatic engagement, 
intensify the broad international response to the Burma military coup 
and escalating military crackdown on the people, and urge the military 
to cease the violence, release all those unjustly detained, allow 
unhindered humanitarian access, and restore Burma's path to inclusive 
democracy. The coup and subsequent violence perpetrated by the Burmese 
military regime has increased instability along Thailand's borders, as 
it has across the region.
    I would encourage Thailand, as the leading economy and our only 
treaty ally in mainland Southeast Asia, to step up pressure on the 
regime to promote a peaceful resolution to the crisis and to hold the 
regime fully accountable its commitments under the ASEAN Five-Point 
Consensus.

    Question. Do you agree that a top priority of the U.S. Department 
of State is to ensure the health, safety, and security of U.S. 
diplomats living and working abroad?

    Answer. Yes, I agree that it is a top priority of the Department of 
State to protect the health, safety, and security of all U.S. 
diplomats, mission staff, and their families living and working abroad. 
I made this a top priority as Ambassador to Kenya and to Tunisia, as 
well as in the leadership positions I have held in the Bureau of Near 
Eastern Affairs and the Bureau of African Affairs. Doing so was of 
particular and personal importance to me having been assigned to 
Embassy Nairobi when it was bombed in 1998. If confirmed, I commit to 
upholding this responsibility in support of all members of Mission 
Thailand. I also commit to keeping an open line of communication with 
our staff to hear about any and all concerns they may have in these 
areas, and to work with the Deputy Chief of Mission and all relevant 
offices to ensure all staff and families have a sense of safety and 
security.

    Question. Do you agree that this is a top priority, especially when 
a U.S. diplomat abroad is under direct threat?

    Answer. Yes. The safety, health, and security of our diplomats, 
mission staff, and families abroad under direct threat is a top 
priority and, if confirmed, I would work to ensure that it is so for 
Mission Thailand just as I have in all my previous assignments. If 
confirmed, I commit to working with all relevant security agencies and 
officials from the United States and Thailand to ensure protection for 
all mission personnel, staff, and families from any threat. In doing 
so, I would draw on my experience in leadership positions in which I 
have responded to a wide range of threats, including terrorist attacks, 
and kept our diplomats, staff, and families safe.

On the Departure of the Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to South Africa in 
        January 2021-February 2021
    Question. The following questions revolve around your time as 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State (2020-2021) and later Acting 
Assistant Secretary of State/Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
State (2021) in the Bureau of African Affairs.

   In September 2020, Politico reported that ``[t]he Iranian 
        government is weighing an assassination attempt against the 
        American Ambassador to South Africa, U.S. intelligence reports 
        say, according to a U.S. Government official familiar with the 
        issue and another official who has seen the intelligence,'' 
        adding: ``U.S. officials have been aware of a general threat 
        against the Ambassador, Lana Marks, since the spring, the 
        officials said. But the intelligence about the threat to the 
        Ambassador has become more specific in recent weeks. The 
        Iranian Embassy in Pretoria is involved in the plot, the U.S. 
        Government official said.''

   Between September 2020 and February 2021, did you at any point 
        become aware that then-U.S. Ambassador to South Africa Lana J. 
        Marks faced a specific assassination threat from the Iranian 
        Government--the world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism? If 
        so, when?

    Answer. I became a Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of 
African Affairs in August 2020 but had no responsibility for Mission 
South Africa or its staff or operations. I became the Principal Deputy 
Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of African Affairs on January 13, 
2021, and on January 20, 2021, acting Assistant Secretary. Around that 
time, I was apprised of the threat to Ambassador Marks and that the 
Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Regional Security Officer in Pretoria 
were fully informed and engaged in ensuring Ambassador Marks' safety 
and security.

    Question. On January 11, 2021, then-U.S. Ambassador to South Africa 
Lana J. Marks posted on the website of the U.S. Embassy to South Africa 
a statement on her ongoing recovery from a recent COVID-19 infection. 
She wrote:


          I started to experience shortness of breath and extreme 
        weakness, and as my symptoms worsened, upon the advice of our 
        medical team at the U.S. Embassy, I was admitted to the 
        hospital to seek supplemental oxygen and therapeutic treatment. 
        Shortly after admission on December 28, I was moved to the ICU 
        where I remained for ten days before spending three more days 
        in the COVID-19 unit. Late last week, I was discharged and 
        continue to receive care at home.


    She added:


          This is a tremendously serious and unpredictable illness, and 
        it has been the most physically debilitating thing that I have 
        ever experienced in my entire life.

   Between December 2020 and January 2021, did you at any point become 
        aware that then-U.S. Ambassador to South Africa Lana J. Marks 
        was recovering from a COVID-19 infection in Pretoria, South 
        Africa? If so, when?

    Answer. I became aware that Ambassador Marks was recovering from a 
COVID-19 infection just before I became Principal Deputy Assistant 
Secretary in the Bureau of African Affairs. I was deeply concerned 
about her condition, and I was following her health closely through the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary responsible for Southern Africa and other 
officials. I was assured by the Office of Medical Services that 
Ambassador Marks was receiving the care she needed and that they would 
continue to engage beyond January 20. I was aware of (and agreed with) 
other exceptional steps taken by the Department to protect Ambassador 
Marks' health, including providing a special exception to allow her to 
remain in the Chief of Mission residence while she recovered fully. On 
January 11, 2021, I was grateful to see that Ambassador Marks had 
posted a statement on Embassy Pretoria media platforms stating, ``My 
condition is improving and the doctors are confident that I will 
eventually make a full recovery.''

    Question. When outgoing U.S. Ambassador to South Africa Lana J. 
Marks--who was not only recovering from what she had publicly described 
as a ``tremendously serious and unpredictable illness'' and a 
``physically debilitating'' case of COVID-19 infection, but also the 
subject of an assassination threat from the Iranian regime--beseeched 
you in a phone call on January 19, 2021, to assist her in remaining a 
U.S. Government employee until she returned to the United States, did 
you--in written communication--nevertheless decline to contact the 
transition team or take any action on her behalf? If so, when?

    Answer. In January 2021, I was closely following Ambassador Marks' 
health condition, security, and employment status. I was in direct 
communication with the Office of the Director General of the Foreign 
Service and with the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs 
and the Deputy Assistant Secretary responsible for Southern Africa. On 
January 18, 2021, Ambassador Marks also called me directly regarding 
her employment status in the State Department. The Bureau of African 
Affairs has no authority or responsibility for the employment of non-
career Presidential appointees in the Department of State. These 
decisions are the responsibility of the White House and its office in 
the State Department that handles Presidential personnel, and the 
Director General of the Foreign Service and the Bureau of Global Talent 
Management, who work with incoming transition teams on personnel 
issues. I was also aware that the Director General and the Global 
Talent Management Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary were in direct 
communication with Ambassador Marks regarding her employment status. I 
also understood that the transition team was fully apprised of the 
concerns raised by Ambassador Marks. In light of this, I advised 
Ambassador Marks on January 18 that the channel for resolving her 
employment concerns was the Director General's office. I note that, on 
January 19, Ambassador Marks sent an email to the Global Talent 
Management Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary stating, ``I just 
wanted to also take the opportunity to thank you and DG Perez--and 
everyone CCed on this email--for your very hard work on a fairly 
atypical situation, during atypical circumstances.'' I was copied on 
this email.

    Question. Do you agree that you had the option of contacting the 
transition team and the Director General of the Foreign Service and 
advocating for Ambassador Marks to be retained as a U.S. Government 
employee--for example, through administrative measures such as having 
her temporarily appointed as a non-career Senior Executive Service 
(SES) appointee or a limited-term Foreign Service Officer (FSO)--until 
her safe and secure return to the United States?

    Answer. As noted above, I was engaging with the Assistant Secretary 
of State for African Affairs and the Director General's office about 
Ambassador Marks' employment status, and I understood that all possible 
avenues were considered. I was aware of the communication between the 
Director General's office and Ambassador Marks, and for employment 
options for a political appointee, I believed it was best for her to 
communicate directly with them as they were working with the transition 
team on personnel issues. I am not aware of any avenue that might have 
been available to allow her to remain a U.S. Government employee beyond 
January 20, 2021.

    Question. What is your understanding of when and precisely how 
outgoing U.S. Ambassador to South Africa Lana J. Marks departed South 
Africa and returned to the United States?

    Answer. I understand that Ambassador Marks departed South Africa on 
or about Sunday, February 21, 2021. Embassy Pretoria confirmed in a 
message to me on February 23 that she was in the United States. I was 
advised that she departed without informing Embassy Pretoria. I do not 
have information on how Ambassador Marks returned to the United States.

    Question. As we aim to strengthen our relationship by supporting 
the best interests of the Nepalese people and combatting Chinese 
influence, I am curious to hear what you believe our priorities ought 
to be in Nepal.

   If confirmed, what will your priorities be in Kathmandu? What would 
        you say are the biggest challenges facing Nepal today? What do 
        you see as the solutions to those challenges, and what can the 
        United States do to help?

    Answer. If confirmed, facilitating Nepal's economic growth would be 
a key priority. In February 2022 Nepal's Parliament ratified the $500 
million U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact electricity-and-
roads project in the face of a torrid PRC disinformation campaign. This 
project will build electricity transmission lines to connect Nepal's 
clean, abundant hydropower with South Asia's energy grid. This project 
will increase the prosperity of both of our countries and Nepal's 
resilience in the face of Chinese pressure.
    If confirmed, I would advocate for the human rights of all Nepali 
citizens and residents. This policy priority includes marginalized 
communities and refugee communities, such as Tibetan refugees. I would 
also work to help Nepal strengthen its democratic institutions, as 
Nepal moved to a federal system in 2015. Stronger democratic 
institutions will also help Nepal complete is transitional justice 
plans, that is, those efforts that brought together various parts of 
Nepali society after the end of the 1996-2006 civil war.
    Finally, people and preparedness will be critical--taking care of 
our country team and their families, building our great people-to-
people relationships in Nepal, and preparing for any eventuality, be it 
natural or other types of disasters. Taking care of our people and our 
relationships makes it possible to fully pursue and protect U.S. 
interests.

    Question. Earlier this year, we saw an alarming increase in Chinese 
disinformation aimed at undermining the Nepalese parliament's 
ratification of the MCC Nepal Compact. The Compact is a $500 million 
grant--not loan--that will help Nepal improve its domestic 
infrastructure, increase electricity reliability, and facilitate cross-
border energy trade.

   What are your priorities as Ambassador for deepening U.S.-Nepalese 
        bilateral cooperation in the aftermath of the ratification of 
        the MCC? How do you intend to counter Chinese disinformation in 
        Nepal going forward when it comes to projects that are in the 
        best interests of the Nepalese people?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would champion the MCC electricity-roads 
project through every step of the implementation phase and highlight 
the economic benefits that Nepal will receive from the building of 
electricity lines and roads to export its energy to other parts of 
South Asia. I would also work with my Embassy team to use our foreign 
policy tools to show China's propaganda efforts and help Nepalis be 
resilient to Chinese mis- and disinformation. Our economic 
developmental support for Nepal, which is carried out in a transparent, 
collaborative partnership, helps Nepal strengthen its own foundation of 
national sovereignty and independent decision-making.

    Question. U.S. interests in Nepal include supporting democratic 
institutions, promoting regional stability and security, alleviating 
poverty, promoting human rights, achieving sustainable economic growth, 
protecting the interests of Tibetan refugees, and helping build 
resilience to deal with climate change and natural disasters.

   How do you, if confirmed, plan on balancing these competing 
        interests?

    Answer. As you note, the United States has a broad range of 
interests in Nepal. The essence of an ambassador's job is to advance 
those U.S. interests. The MCC electricity-and-roads project will create 
thousands of jobs for Nepalis and millions of dollars in revenue for 
the country. USAID's recently signed $659 million assistance agreement 
will support democratic institutions and alleviate poverty while 
helping build resilience to climate change and natural disasters. If 
confirmed, I also would work across the interagency to promote the 
rights of all citizens and residents of Nepal, including of refugee 
communities.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 Trafficking in Persons 
Report, Nepal remained on Tier 2 for its ongoing efforts to meet the 
minimum standards to eliminate trafficking but did not adequately do so 
in a few key areas, including failing to criminalize all forms of labor 
and sex trafficking and providing protection for trafficking victims. 
Additionally, government complicity in trafficking remains a serious 
concern.

   How will you work with the Nepalese Government to address these 
        issues if you are confirmed as Ambassador?

    Answer. Nepal has made some progress on combatting trafficking in 
persons in recent years but still has issues to address. If confirmed, 
I will engage the Government of Nepal at the highest levels and press 
to criminalize all forms of trafficking and to put an end to the 
Government's complicity in trafficking. I will employ the resources of 
the Department of State's Trafficking in Persons Office to train Nepali 
officials to prosecute and convict human traffickers.

    Question. The office of to monitor and combat trafficking in 
persons plays a key role in assisting Ambassadors in promoting anti-
trafficking work. Please describe how you can work with the office to 
improve Nepal's anti-trafficking work in country.

    Answer. The office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons (J/
TIP) at the Department of State is already doing great work in Nepal. I 
have worked closely with J/TIP in the past and look forward to regular 
consultation and continued assistance from them, if confirmed. Just 
this past quarter, one of their implementers in Nepal, ECPAT 
Luxembourg, held coordination meetings to create awareness and build 
pressure to develop child protection mechanisms and to help 
stakeholders better understand the status of child rights. They also 
trained over 80 media outlets in Nepal to cover children and 
trafficking in persons issues. If confirmed, I will work closely with 
the J/TIP Office to further this work to help end human trafficking in 
Nepal.

    Question. What concrete steps can you, if confirmed, take with your 
mission to help Nepal improve its anti-trafficking efforts?

    Answer. If confirmed I will work closely with our Department of 
Justice colleagues in Nepal, who run the International Criminal 
Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP) and the Overseas 
Prosecutorial Development and Assistance Training (OPDAT). These 
programs, funded by the Department of State's Bureau of International 
Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, train local law enforcement and 
prosecutors to recognize, arrest, and prosecute transnational crime, 
such as human trafficking. If confirmed, I will continue with these 
programs to put the criminals guilty of human trafficking behind bars.
    Working with our J/TIP Office colleagues and implementers, I will 
also focus on helping Nepal to assist the victims. If confirmed, I will 
engage directly to encourage and underscore the importance of providing 
victim assistance. If confirmed, as Chief of Mission, I will ensure our 
Embassy is forward leaning in its engagement with Nepal to meet the 
standards of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, highlighted concerns regarding treatment of Christians 
and Tibetan communities in Nepal. In particular, concerns regarding 
discrimination and prohibiting conversion.

   What is your assessment of this particular issue and if confirmed, 
        how will you work with the Ambassador-at-Large to bolster 
        religious freedom in-country?

    Answer. While Nepal is tolerant in many ways, there have been 
concerns in recent years regarding religious freedom. We have seen 
media reporting on the Government of Nepal prohibiting Tibetan refugees 
from celebrating cultural and religious holidays. If confirmed, I will 
work with the International Religious Freedom Office to stand up for 
religious rights for people of all faiths. I will engage with Nepali 
Government officials and raise concerns regarding religious 
intolerance. It is a universal human right for all citizens to practice 
one's faith.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 Human Rights Report, Nepal 
was noted as having several significant human rights abuses, including 
credible reports of torture, cruel and inhumane treatment by government 
officials and arbitrary arrests. Additionally, there are reports of 
serious restrictions on freedom of expression, association, and 
movement.

   If confirmed, what steps will you take to continue to address these 
        instances with the host government?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will stand for human rights in Nepal. I 
will work with our Human Rights Officer and with the Department of 
State's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) to engage 
civil society, raise concerns with the Government, and advance human 
rights for all citizens and residents of Nepal. DRL has great programs 
to bring awareness to human rights, and I will work closely with our 
DRL Bureau to use those programs to put a stop to torture and inhumane 
treatment. I will work with our Department of Justice officials in 
charge of ICITAP to promote humane policing. In cases of gross human 
rights violations, I will call out such violations. In doing all these 
things, we can help Nepal put a stop to human rights abuses.

    Question. How will you direct your Embassy to work with civil 
society organizations to improve the human rights situation on the 
ground?

    Answer. Our Embassy in Nepal regularly engages with civil society 
and, if confirmed, I would ensure that such engagement continues. Civil 
society organizations (CSO) in Nepal work with the Embassy to improve 
human rights for Nepali citizens and residents. USAID has an annual 
budget of $16 million to work with NGOs and CSOs on a variety of 
issues, the advancement of human rights chief among them. If confirmed, 
I will work with USAID colleagues to continue to coordinate with CSOs 
that stand up for the human rights of all Nepalis.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to personally raising human 
rights issues with the Nepalese Government?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I commit to personally raising human 
rights issues with the Government of Nepal.

    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Kathmandu?

    Answer. Under its current outstanding leadership, the morale at 
Mission Kathmandu is high. If confirmed, I will work to keep it so.

    Question. If confirmed, how do you intend to improve morale at 
Mission Kathmandu?

    Answer. If confirmed, taking care of the staff and families at the 
Mission will be my highest priority. I will endeavor to create a 
caring, respectful environment where all feel safe and secure--both 
personally and professionally. We have numerous important U.S. 
interests to look after in Nepal, and we need our team and their 
families well cared for in order to achieve this mission.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Kathmandu?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will create a unified mission and vision 
through diligent strategic planning, broad engagement across the 
mission, and inclusive leadership. I will use my experience and 
judgement and that of my team to focus our initiatives to produce 
results for the American people. I will be generous in recognizing the 
accomplishments of others while also being the first to take 
responsibility for any errors. I will create an environment of trust 
and respect where all can share their talents toward the goals of the 
mission.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. Working at an Embassy isn't just a regular job. It's part 
of broader family and lifestyle commitment. I care about our people and 
their families, and I care about their professional development. If 
confirmed, as Chief of Mission, I would engage our community as a whole 
and commit to finding ways to help everyone feel included, welcome, and 
part of our overall mission community. I would seek to recruit a 
diverse team of Americans and local staff. If confirmed, I would work 
closely with my DCM to ensure we have effective and proper mentoring 
and professional development opportunities across all grades and 
agencies, and I would seek feedback to evaluate our success or need for 
change. The American people entrust us with a mission and resources 
and, if confirmed, I would hold myself and our larger team accountable 
for our efforts.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No. Never. If confirmed, I would ensure everyone working at 
the Embassy is treated with dignity and respect. I do not believe it is 
acceptable or constructive to berate subordinates ever, either in 
public or privately.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I expect to have close, continuing 
communication with my DCM about roles and responsibilities. I expect 
she would function as the Chief Operating Officer of the mission and 
also be ready to step in should I become incapacitated or am away from 
post. I expect to employ a consultative, collaborative leadership 
approach, but one in which I accept ultimate responsibility for the 
outcomes of our actions and policy implementation.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I expect that my DCM will take on key 
leadership responsibilities including oversight of the Family Advocacy 
Committee, all post-level mentoring programs for entry-level and mid-
level officers and local staff, and chair of the Emergency Action 
Committee. If confirmed, I would expect the DCM to remain closely 
engaged with our Management section to ensure proper oversight and 
management controls are in place and that I am fully aware of any 
challenges or deficiencies on that front. I would also expect that the 
DCM would share with me leadership on matters related to the 
implementation of a diverse and inclusive workforce that fosters 
respect, productivity and professional engagement across all sections 
and agencies.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. I do believe it is important to provide employees with 
accurate and constructive feedback on their performance to encourage 
improvement and to reward those who succeed. I meet with direct reports 
and reviewed employees to ensure they get feedback on their 
performance. If confirmed, I would continue that practice in Kathmandu.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees to improve performance and 
reward high achievers.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Nepal.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our Embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. COVID-19 and other resource constraints have limited our 
engagement outside Embassy walls. As we come out of the COVID pandemic 
it will be particularly important to ensure U.S. diplomats re-engage 
across the whole of society. In my opinion, U.S. diplomats should get 
outside of the embassies as much as possible, in consultation with the 
Regional Security Office when appropriate, to fully accomplish their 
missions. If confirmed, I will always encourage my staff to get outside 
of our Embassy walls more, to better understand our host country and to 
deliver results for the American people.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would work closely with the DCM, Regional 
Security Officer and individual sections to ensure they compile robust 
reporting and travel plans that are geared to the goals of the 
integrated country strategy and that provide us good contacts and 
insights from across the country. I will work with our management team 
and Washington to get the resources we need to engage and deliver our 
key messages to the people of Nepal.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in Nepal?

    Answer. The public diplomacy environment in Nepal is difficult 
because of the mis- and disinformation that pervades social media and 
some elements of traditional media. If confirmed, I would work closely 
with our country team, likeminded embassies, the Nepali Government and 
civil society to broaden access to quality, accurate information and to 
speak truth to the people of Nepal about the United States, its 
interests and its intentions in its bilateral relationship with Nepal.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. The Nepali media and social media landscape, like in so 
many countries, contends with mis- and disinformation. In the modern 
world, where so many have access to the internet, false stories are 
prevalent, as we saw in spades with the Millennium Challenge 
Corporation (MCC) Compact. The public affairs team at the Mission did 
great work in contrasting the disinformation surrounding the Compact 
with clear explanations about what the Compact was and what it will do 
for Nepal and its people. If confirmed, I will work with the public 
affairs office in Kathmandu to continue that great work.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. I believe that the mission understands the nuances of the 
media and the audience in country the best while Main State has a 
holistic, global view. Thus, it is imperative that the mission guide 
the foreign policy in country while always coordinating closely with 
Main State to ensure consistency and accuracy with respect to our 
messaging. At the same time, in the information environment, speed is 
critical. If confirmed, I would work closely with our professionals at 
post and experts in DC to ensure we have sufficient agility to be 
proactive in our messaging, but to also respond quickly and accurately 
whenever required.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel. The past occurrences and ongoing threat of anomalous 
health incidents among Embassy personnel and their families poses a 
serious challenge to morale. When personnel at post fear for their 
safety or doubt that their case will be taken seriously if they were 
affected, the performance of Embassy operations can suffer.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will take this threat seriously and 
make sure our team members have all the information available to 
protect themselves and their families.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Kathmandu personnel?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will regularly talk as openly as 
possible to Mission Kathmandu personnel.

    Question. Have you received a briefing on the anomalous health 
incidents that have occurred to U.S. Government personnel around the 
world, including at U.S. embassies and other diplomatic posts? If you 
have not, and if you are confirmed, do you commit to receiving a 
briefing on the incidents before you depart for your post?

    Answer. I will receive a briefing on anomalous health incident 
(AHI) on Monday, July 18. If confirmed, I will consult specifically 
with AHI coordinator's office, as appropriate, about Nepal.

    Question. In the event of an anomalous health incident among your 
Embassy personnel or eligible family members, do you commit to maintain 
detailed records of the incident, and share the information with the 
State Department and other embassies to contribute to the investigation 
of how these attacks are affecting U.S. missions and personnel around 
the world?

    Answer. If confirmed, I do commit to maintaining detailed records 
of the incident and to share information with the State Department and 
other embassies to contribute to the investigation of how those attacks 
are affecting U.S. missions and personnel around the world. I would 
ensure that our Regional Security Office and Health Unit follow all 
appropriate protocols and engage the appropriate experts in Washington 
to ensure full care of our personnel.

    Question. Whether or not anomalous health incidents occur at your 
Embassy, how will you work to restore and preserve morale that may be 
lost due to the knowledge these attacks have been occurring at posts 
around the world?

    Answer. We learned a lot from the COVID experience with respect to 
the fear and uncertainty that can come from threats to health. If 
confirmed, I will always let my staff and families know that their 
health and security come first. When it comes to their well-being, I 
will have an open-door policy and foster an environment where the staff 
and families can share their concerns in safety.

    Question. New Hampshire has a strong and active community of 
Nepali-Americans. In my years of government service, here in the Senate 
and in New Hampshire, I have seen the tremendous benefits of engaging 
closely with diaspora communities here at home.

   If confirmed, will you commit to close engagement with the Nepali-
        American community in New Hampshire and in other states?

    Answer. I have also found the benefits in working closely with 
diaspora communities during my time with the State Department. The 
State Department is engaged with the Nepali-American community in New 
Hampshire, and I can confirm that, if nominated, I would commit to 
close engagement with the Nepali-American community in New Hampshire 
and other states.

               to Dean R. Thompson by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. Under current Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, Nepal 
has sought to rebalance its foreign policy away from the pro-Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP) pursued by his predecessor, KP Sharma Oli of the 
Nepali Communist Party. Prime Minister Deuba has stopped progress on 
Nepal's Belt and Road Initiative projects and has worked with Indian 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi to repair Nepal-India relations.

   Is the CCP's engagement with Nepal a threat to U.S. interests? 
        Please explain

    Answer. The Chinese Communist Party's interests and activities in 
Nepal are a concern. For example, the PRC has recently used 
misinformation in an attempt to derail the U.S. Millennium Challenge 
Corporation (MCC) Compact in Nepal, a project that will bring thousands 
of jobs and millions of dollars in revenue to Nepal. If confirmed, I 
would build on our long-standing efforts to strengthen Nepal's 
sovereignty and its ability to maintain its independence both in 
internal and foreign policy decision-making. I would push back on 
misinformation and highlight the benefits of the U.S.-Nepali 
relationship to the Nepali people and our sincere and transparent 
interest in helping Nepal's development.

    Question. Does the Chinese Communist Party pose a threat to the 
United States? Please explain.

    Answer. As Secretary Blinken said, the PRC is the only country with 
both the intent to reshape the international order and the economic, 
diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. Beijing 
presents a vision that would move us away from the universal values 
that have sustained so much of the world's progress over the past 75 
years. Under President Xi, the PRC has become more aggressive abroad, 
and the United States must respond with strength, with the 
determination to defend territorial integrity, international law, and 
institutions that have brought prosperity to so many parts of the 
world.

    Question. Is it in the U.S. interest to encourage positive ties 
between India and Nepal? If yes, how can we best encourage these ties?

    Answer. India and Nepal share an important relationship. They are 
linked historically and culturally, and India is Nepal's largest trade 
partner and investor. The United States supports those strong ties, and 
the MCC Compact, which will promote the trade of clean Nepali 
hydropower energy throughout South Asia. Our MCC electricity-and-roads 
project is a great example of how the United States can build upon and 
grow those important ties. If confirmed, I would work to see the MCC 
Compact implemented to the benefit of both Nepal and India.

    Question. What remaining divisions in the India-Nepal relationship 
could the CCP exploit to drive a wedge between the two countries?

    Answer. India-Nepali ties run deep. In addition to their important 
economic ties, India-Nepali security ties are crucial. The Indo-Nepal 
1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship expressly notes neither country 
will ``tolerate any threat to the security of the other by a foreign 
aggressor.'' In short, the CCP will have a difficult time overcoming 
the important historical, economic, and defense relationships that 
Nepal and India maintain. If confirmed, I would work to call out any 
PRC manipulation or aggression that may seek to do so.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to encourage closer ties 
between Nepal and India?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue to build on the important 
coordination established during the discussions on the MCC Compact 
project. One of the conditions for the project was the creation of a 
joint-venture company between Nepal and India, so that Nepal could sell 
its clean hydropower energy to India. This type of cooperation is 
foundational and, if confirmed, I would use it to promote similar 
cooperation between our three countries.

    Question. Over the many decades, but especially recently under 
General Secretary Xi Jinping, the Himalayas have become a source of 
conflict between India and the CCP. This has sometimes led to violent 
clashes, such as in Doklam in neighboring Bhutan. The CCP, the 
aggressor, has deliberately forced Tibetans to move into Nepali, 
Bhutanese, and Indian Territory in the high Himalayas in an effort to 
move border markers further south.

   What is your appraisal of ongoing border tensions between the CCP 
        and the Himalayan countries, including Nepal?

    Answer. The PRC has indeed encroached on its neighbors in the 
Himalayas, including in Bhutan as you noted in 2017 on the Doklam 
Plateau. Regarding the border with Nepal, although there have been 
allegations reported in local media, we have found no evidence of PRC 
encroachment. Nevertheless, if confirmed, I would resolutely support 
Nepal's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

    Question. What role can the U.S. play in supporting Nepal, Bhutan, 
and India in resisting CCP encroachment?

    Answer. The United States must stand for territorial integrity 
throughout the world. Nepal is no exception. If confirmed, I would 
determinedly support its territorial integrity and sovereignty.

    Question. Nepal lies directly on the border with CCP-occupied 
Tibet. Tibetan refugees in Nepal live under movement restrictions while 
there are reports of Nepali security officials engaging in sexual 
violence against refugees. These conditions are deplorable and support 
CCP propaganda.

   Are you aware of the changes to U.S. policy toward Tibetan refugees 
        in Nepal that Congress passed in recent years, including my 
        Tibetan Policy and Support Act?

    Answer. I am aware of the Tibetan Policy and Support Act, and I 
thank Congress for its support of the Tibetan people. If confirmed, I 
would work to support the rights of Tibetan refugees in Nepal and would 
use all the tools at our disposal to do so.

    Question. If confirmed, how do you plan to implement these policies 
toward Tibetan refugees?

    Answer. If confirmed, consistent with the Tibetan Policy and 
Support Act, I would urge the Government of Nepal to provide legal 
documentation to long-staying Tibetan residents in Nepal. This 
documentation is necessary for Tibetan refugees to more fully 
participate in Nepali society and the Nepali economy, and I would 
engage the Government of Nepal to fully promote this policy. I would 
also make use of the generous assistance that Congress provided in the 
Act to promote and preserve Tibetan culture and language and to build 
the resilience of Tibetan communities in Nepal.

    Question. If confirmed, will you raise the issue of Tibetan 
refugees with the Nepali Government?

    Answer. If confirmed, I vow to raise the issues affecting Tibetan 
refugees with the Government of Nepal.

    Question. If confirmed, how would you work to counter Chinese 
misinformation about the MCC and U.S.-Nepalese relations more broadly?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would clearly articulate that the U.S. 
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact is an electricity and 
roads project that will bring revenue to Nepal and help the Nepali 
people. More broadly, I would work to counter PRC disinformation and 
demonstrate to the Nepali people and government that the United States 
is a partner that operates transparently and values Nepal's sovereignty 
and independence.

    Question. In your view, what does the MCC Compact mean for the 
people of Nepal? If confirmed, how would you demonstrate the value and 
purpose of the MCC Compact?

    Answer. The MCC electricity-and-roads project will strengthen 
Nepal's economic and energy independence, providing thousands of jobs 
and millions of dollars in revenue annually to the people of Nepal. If 
confirmed, I would champion the MCC electricity-roads project through 
every step of the implementation phase and highlight the economic 
benefits that Nepal will receive from the building of electricity lines 
and roads to export its energy to other parts of South Asia.

    Question. Are there ways we should respond if China were to 
undertake more aggressive attempts at economic coercion against Nepal?

    Answer. We see China's attempts to coerce Nepal. If confirmed, I 
would work with my Embassy team to use our foreign policy tools to show 
China's propaganda efforts and help Nepalis be resilient to Chinese 
mis- and disinformation. Our economic developmental support for Nepal, 
which is carried out in a transparent, collaborative fashion, helps 
Nepal strengthen its own foundation of national sovereignty and 
independent decision-making. Our developmental support includes the 
$500 million MCC electricity-roads project and $659 million in USAID 
development assistance. We also engage the U.S. private sector--
including the newly formed American Chamber of Commerce in Nepal--to 
increase trade with Nepal and improve the business environment.

    Question. What will be your top priorities in Jakarta, should you 
be confirmed? What role does ASEAN play in the Biden administration's 
Indo-Pacific Strategy and in U.S. policy towards Asia broadly?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work to implement the Administration's 
Indo-Pacific strategy, with a focus on supporting our commitment to a 
free and open Indo-Pacific, one where countries and individuals are 
able to make independent decisions free from coercion. With a 
commitment to a rules-based order and an economically vibrant, 
youthful, and growing population, ASEAN plays a critical role in the 
Biden administration's Indo-Pacific Strategy. A strong and independent 
ASEAN will be a key partner in addressing shared challenges, seizing 
emerging opportunities, and advancing our shared interests. If 
confirmed, I will look to build on ongoing, whole-of-government efforts 
to support ASEAN centrality and the ASEAN-led regional architecture, 
while building ASEAN's capacity to act on its interests and deliver 
meaningful solutions to the region's most pressing challenges.
    Strengthening ASEAN's own capacity will increase our ability to 
work together on a range of critical shared opportunities and 
challenges, including the tragic and disturbing crisis in Burma, the 
PRC's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea, health security, 
energy and climate issues, and the economic prosperity of our combined 
one billion people.
    If confirmed, I will also prioritize ensuring the durability of our 
partnership with ASEAN, specifically by building on already-strong 
bipartisan Congressional support for U.S. engagement with ASEAN and 
supporting people-to-people programs, including the Young Southeast 
Asian Leaders Initiative.
    Finally, and importantly, leading the U.S. Mission to ASEAN starts 
with taking care of its people. If confirmed, supporting my team and 
ensuring their safety and security would be my top management priority.

Indo-Pacific and Asia Strategy through ASEAN Centrality
    Question. The Biden administration has repeatedly emphasized the 
importance of developing strong relationships in the Indo-Pacific and 
Asia, particularly through ASEAN, as key to American international 
strategy and a rules-based order.

   How do you view ``ASEAN centrality'' in regional diplomacy? How 
        should the United States support ASEAN centrality and how do 
        you plan to do that, should you be confirmed?

    Answer. Given our shared commitment to the rules-based 
international order, I believe that a strong and independent ASEAN is 
essential to the regional architecture of the Indo-Pacific, and that 
our partnership with ASEAN is essential to maintaining a free and open 
Indo-Pacific. It is in the national security interests of the United 
States for ASEAN to be strong, prosperous, united, and well-equipped to 
withstand coercive activity.
    If confirmed, I will work to build on ongoing, whole-of-government 
efforts to build ASEAN's own capacity to act on a range of shared 
interests. If confirmed, I will also work to ensure the United States 
and our interests are robustly represented in ASEAN forums, and I will 
ensure that we continue to work bilaterally and multilaterally to 
strengthen critical partnerships in the region.

Indo-Pacific Economic Framework
    Question. Seven members of ASEAN have joined President Biden's 
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework as the U.S. works to counter the malign 
influence of China's economic coercion in the region.

   How will you, if confirmed, support these negotiations? How does 
        IPEF fit into our broader economic diplomacy in the region?

    Answer. Economic engagement with the Indo-Pacific broadly, and 
ASEAN specifically, is critical to advancing our economic prosperity 
and national security interests, as well as those of our allies and 
partners. This year, President Biden launched the Indo-Pacific Economic 
Framework (IPEF), aimed at enabling the U.S. and our allies and 
partners to deepen our economic engagement, drive inclusive prosperity 
in the United States and throughout the Indo-Pacific, and set the rules 
on critical 21st century economic challenges and opportunities. The 
framework is the President's signature economic initiative in the 
region, and complements ongoing economic engagement with ASEAN, APEC, 
the Quad, and bilateral efforts.
    If confirmed, I would work closely with Congress, my bilateral 
colleagues across the region, and my colleagues in Washington to 
achieve high-ambition outcomes in the discussions under each pillar of 
IPEF. I would do so by seeking to understand the perspectives of my 
counterparts in Jakarta and working with my interagency colleagues on 
ways to achieve both American and partner objectives.

Coordination with Allies on Security Initiatives
    Question. The QUAD, composed of Japan, Australia, India, and many 
of our other allies and partners, including South Korea and European 
nations, are heavily focused on security in the region as we counter 
Chinese aggression.

   What opportunities are there for U.S. coordination with allies and 
        partners, such as these nations, on ASEAN development and 
        security initiatives? How, if confirmed, do you plan on working 
        with your U.S. diplomatic colleagues in the region to pursue 
        these opportunities?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work closely with my diplomatic 
colleagues in the region to promote regional connectivity amongst our 
allies and partners, a tenet of the United States Indo-Pacific 
Strategy. I believe that significant opportunities exist to advance our 
interests, as well as those of our allies and partners, through greater 
regional connectivity and cooperation. The Quad--a partnership based on 
values--shares our commitment to democracy, peace, security, and 
prosperity in the region. The Quad seeks to support and build on our 
longstanding multilateral partnerships and recognizes ASEAN centrality 
as a main pillar of regional engagement. In the Joint Vision Statement 
that leaders adopted at the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit in Washington, 
D.C., the U.S. and ASEAN welcomed the support extended by ASEAN 
Dialogue Partners through various initiatives, including the Quad 
Vaccine Partnership. The Quad has also announced a new initiative on 
maritime domain awareness that will benefit ASEAN nations. If 
confirmed, I will look to foster and facilitate cooperation between 
ASEAN and the Quad, and I will also work with others, including 
European partners, on other areas of possible collaboration. I will do 
so by working closely with my counterparts in Jakarta--both those from 
ASEAN nations and those from other partners and allies--to see if 
flexible groupings can help accomplish shared objectives.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you advocate for the continued 
promotion and protection of internationally-recognized human rights in 
ASEAN member countries?

    Answer. As I said in my opening statement, a critical component of 
advancing our interests is standing up for our values. President Biden 
has said that human rights are a vital interest of this 
administration's foreign policy. If confirmed, I will not hesitate to 
raise issues of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law with my 
counterparts, including as we work to address the worsening political 
and humanitarian crises in Burma. If confirmed, I will support ASEAN in 
continuing to restrict Burma's representation at senior-level ASEAN 
events, and I will work with colleagues and counterparts around the 
region on ways to increase pressure on the regime to change its 
calculus.
    In addition, the United States has numerous ongoing training and 
development programs to advance respect for human rights in Southeast 
Asia. For example, the Mission's public diplomacy section designed an 
in-person workshop for women human rights defenders from all ASEAN 
member states, plus Timor-Leste, that will occur in Thailand in August 
2022. If confirmed, I will continue supporting the efforts of regional 
human rights defenders, and I will ensure that the team at our Mission 
continues to diligently monitor the human rights situation across 
Southeast Asia. I appreciate Congressional attention to this issue and 
look forward to close consultations.

    Question. Within the ASEAN Declaration on Human Rights, there is a 
priority area of cooperation that says, ``Take initiative with a 
preventive approach in addressing humanitarian issues, including public 
health emergencies, with regional and international humanitarian 
consequences and impacts on human rights.'' If confirmed, please detail 
any possible steps you could take to advance this particular tenet of 
the declaration within ASEAN nations.

    Answer. I believe that taking a preventative approach to 
humanitarian issues and public health emergencies is critical to our 
national security and that of the ASEAN member states. If confirmed, I 
would ensure that the United States continues to work closely with 
ASEAN member states and the Secretariat's disaster response authorities 
to plan for, prepare for, and respond to both natural and man-made 
disasters. If confirmed, I will also advocate for strong U.S. 
humanitarian support for the peoples of ASEAN in times of crisis, and I 
would work closely with USAID, the coordinator for international 
disaster assistance efforts. If confirmed, I will look to advance 
programs that build the capacity of our allies and partners to prepare 
for the next disaster, including by strengthening the ASEAN 
Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance and supporting disaster 
risk reduction programs implemented by our bilateral Missions in ASEAN 
member states.
    COVID-19 has reminded us all that pandemics know no borders, and we 
must work together to prevent and respond to public health emergencies. 
If confirmed, I would prioritize building on U.S.-ASEAN Health Futures, 
including by supporting the CDC's efforts to enhance pan-respiratory 
disease surveillance in the region and USAID's support for the ASEAN 
Public Health Emergency Coordination System, which will improve 
regional cooperation and information-sharing on public health 
emergencies.

State Department Manangement and Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout the U.S. mission to ASEAN?

    Answer. It is my understanding that the U.S. Mission to ASEAN staff 
is a talented, dedicated group. I also understand that, like many 
workplaces around the world, pandemic-related restrictions have taken a 
toll on the team and their families. Strict lockdowns in Indonesia 
prevented in-person schooling for the children of the Mission's 
personnel, and other lockdown regulations altered or halted the regular 
rhythms of social and professional engagement.
    I understand that Indonesia is beginning to lift those lockdowns 
and related restrictions and that travel has opened back up again. If 
confirmed, ensuring the health and well-being, both physical and 
emotional, of the Mission's personnel would be a top priority. If 
confirmed, I will look for creative ways to boost morale and will 
prioritize supporting the team and their families as they work to 
promote our interests.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at the U.S. mission 
to ASEAN?

    Answer. Morale is a critical driver of both the well-being of the 
USASEAN team and their ability to advance America's interests. As such, 
if confirmed, I would take as my duty the stewardship of the team's and 
their families' morale. Morale can never be too high, and I will 
continuously prioritize improving it.
    If confirmed, I will listen to the team. I will work with the 
Deputy Chief of Mission to understand their perspectives, their 
aspirations, their ideas, and their frustrations. I would then work to 
build systems, structures, and norms that would help bolster and 
maintain the team's sense of community and devotion to our core 
mission.
    The ASEAN Mission is co-located with Embassy Jakarta, and if 
confirmed, I would seek to work with, and learn from, State and USAID 
leadership at Embassy Jakarta to help build morale.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at the U.S. mission to ASEAN?

    Answer. I believe it is critical for a team to have a clear sense 
of what they are working for and what they are working toward, and, if 
confirmed, I will prioritize creating a unified mission and vision at 
the U.S. Mission to ASEAN. If confirmed, I will start by listening to 
those already at the U.S. Mission to ASEAN to understand their current 
priorities and perspectives, and I will make sure to clearly 
communicate the Administration's strategic priorities and the Mission's 
role in furthering them.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I believe teams operate best when leaders are willing to 
listen to, learn from, and empower those they are charged to guide. My 
management style is centered on communication, empowerment, and 
camaraderie. I believe my job as a manager is to set clear expectations 
and priorities; to remove obstacles to success; to procure and provide 
the tools and resources necessary for the team to succeed; and to make 
sure the team is operating in an environment that breeds trust, 
respect, and partnership.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No. I do not believe it is ever acceptable to berate 
subordinates in any setting. If confirmed, I commit to providing a 
safe, respectful, and professional working environment for all Mission 
personnel.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. The relationship between an ambassador and a Deputy Chief 
of Mission is critical to the success of the team. If confirmed, I will 
prioritize ensuring this relationship is rooted in trust. If confirmed, 
I will empower my Deputy Chief of Mission to serve as the team's chief 
operating officer, and I will regularly seek her counsel and look to 
make maximum use of her experience and expertise.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will empower my Deputy Chief of Mission to 
serve as the team's chief operating officer, relying on her knowledge 
of Department policies and procedures to ensure the smooth functioning 
of the U.S. Mission to ASEAN. I would also regularly seek her counsel 
on the full range of leadership, management, and policy issues the 
Mission faces.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. I believe it is critical to provide employees with 
accurate, constructive feedback on their performance in order to 
recognize their good work, encourage professional development, and 
reward those who most successfully advance the interests of the 
country. Meaningful, thoughtful feedback also conveys that a manager 
cares for their employees. EERs are particularly important for foreign 
service employees, as they directly impact their career trajectory and 
promotions. If confirmed, I will ensure that Mission leadership 
prioritizes accurate, constructive feedback, including through the EER 
process, and I will lead by example.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Feedback is critical. It directly fuels performance and 
morale. Managers owe their teams regular, thoughtful feedback. If 
confirmed, I would support and encourage clear, accurate, and direct 
feedback to employees in order to recognize their good work, encourage 
professional development, and reward those who most successfully 
advance the interests of the country.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
ASEAN nations. In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our 
Embassy walls enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. Diplomacy requires engagement, and in my opinion, there can 
never be enough engagement with the communities in which we serve, 
within the bounds of prudent health and security measures. If 
confirmed, I will encourage the U.S. Mission to ASEAN team to conduct 
outreach, make contacts, and spend time outside of the Mission, within 
the bounds of my commitment to their health and safety. If confirmed, I 
would do so by leading by example, making it a priority to engage 
outside of the Mission.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would work closely with the Regional 
Security Officer to maximize the ability of Mission employees to spend 
time outside the Mission, directly interacting with local populations, 
within the bounds of prudent health and security measures. If 
confirmed, I would work closely with Ambassadors and USAID Mission 
Directors in our bilateral Missions in ASEAN member states to build on, 
and learn from, their experience reaching local populations, including 
traveling jointly, when possible. Better accessing local populations 
also means employing creative tactics. If confirmed, I would work with 
the public affairs team and others across the bilateral missions of 
each ASEAN member state to ensure we are reaching key audiences in a 
strategic way.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in ASEAN 
nations?

    Answer. Public diplomacy is of critical importance to our strategic 
interests in ASEAN, and I understand the public diplomacy environment 
to be well suited for active U.S. engagement. While each nation is 
unique, the youth of Southeast Asia are overall eager to engage with 
America, as are the businesses of the region. If confirmed, I would 
work to expand and strengthen the relationship between our peoples, 
businesses, civil society, and governments. If confirmed, I will also 
be cognizant, with insight from the public affairs teams, of the 
challenges in certain environments. Important voices in some ASEAN 
member states are subject to human rights abuses; discrimination; and 
limitations on freedom of speech, the press, and assembly. The ease or 
difficulty of conducting public affairs programs ranges from country to 
country, and even from city to city. If confirmed, I will rely on 
public affairs professionals to provide me with the insights I need to 
be effective.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. I understand the COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge for 
public diplomacy programming across ASEAN member states, although many 
initiatives have continued by shifting online. As COVID-19 restrictions 
continue to ease, I will seek to expand our in-person public diplomacy 
efforts, within the bounds of my commitment to the health and safety of 
Mission staff.
    In addition, as I understand it, U.S. spending on public diplomacy 
in ASEAN nations is dwarfed by that of the People's Republic of China 
(PRC). If confirmed, I will seek to ensure our public diplomacy 
resources are sufficient to successfully combat PRC disinformation, as 
well as Russian disinformation, while ensuring high quality programming 
that makes good use of those resources.
    Some civil society contacts in Southeast Asia, including emerging 
voices and established leaders, are at risk of arrest, harassment, or 
imprisonment, particularly citizen journalists and human rights 
defenders. Each ASEAN member state has a different environment with 
varying degrees of challenges that affect outreach initiatives. If 
confirmed, I will to rely on Mission staff for the insights I need to 
understand the variety of challenges within the region.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will seek to learn and draw from the local 
expertise of the U.S. Mission to ASEAN team. The team has a crucial 
role in formulating public diplomacy programs and messages. I 
understand that the Mission public affairs team has developed relations 
with counterpart teams located in all ten ASEAN member states, and that 
they are well networked in the Department. If confirmed, I will rely on 
their valuable insights, and I will seek their counsel to ensure we are 
calibrating our efforts appropriately for regional audiences. I will do 
so in a way that is appropriately coordinated with the Department, 
under the policy direction of the Secretary, such that we can best 
advance our strategic interests.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel. The past occurrences and ongoing threat of anomalous 
health incidents among Embassy personnel and their families poses a 
serious challenge to morale. When personnel at post fear for their 
safety or doubt that their case will be taken seriously if they were 
affected, the performance of Embassy operations can suffer.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. I am deeply troubled by anomalous health incidents reported 
by U.S. Government personnel, including Embassy personnel and their 
family members. I agree we must take these reported incidents seriously 
and ensure that our workforce receives the care and support they need 
and deserve. If confirmed, I would have no higher priority than the 
health, safety, and security of the U.S. Mission to ASEAN staff and 
their families.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to the U.S. mission to ASEAN personnel?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to talking as openly as I can to 
mission personnel not only about anomalous health incidents, but other 
issues as well. If confirmed, I commit to regularly sharing new 
information on this issue, consistent with ensuring the integrity of 
ongoing investigations. If confirmed, I commit to doing everything in 
my power to protect the health and safety of our team members and their 
families.

    Question. Have you received a briefing on the anomalous health 
incidents that have occurred to U.S. Government personnel around the 
world, including at U.S. embassies and other diplomatic posts? If you 
have not, and if you are confirmed, do you commit to receiving a 
briefing on the incidents before you depart for your post?

    Answer. In my capacity as the Chief of Staff and Executive 
Secretary of the National Security Council (NSC) Staff, I have been and 
will continue to be briefed on anomalous health incidents. If 
confirmed, I commit to receiving additional relevant briefings, 
including to learn any best practices in the event Mission staff or 
their families report an incident.

    Question. In the event of an anomalous health incident among your 
Embassy personnel or eligible family members, do you commit to maintain 
detailed records of the incident, and share the information with the 
State Department and other embassies to contribute to the investigation 
of how these attacks are affecting U.S. missions and personnel around 
the world?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to maintain detailed records of the 
incident, and share the information with the State Department and other 
embassies to contribute to the investigation of how these attacks are 
affecting U.S. missions and personnel around the world.

    Question. Whether or not anomalous health incidents occur at your 
Embassy, how will you work to restore and preserve morale that may be 
lost due to the knowledge these attacks have been occurring at posts 
around the world?

    Answer. If confirmed, my top priority would be ensuring the safety 
and security of U.S. Mission to ASEAN personnel. If confirmed, I will 
prioritize improving and maintaining the morale of the team, and I 
wholeheartedly commit to talking as openly as I can to mission 
personnel not only about anomalous health incidents, but other issues 
as well. I believe that transparency will have a positive impact on 
morale. If confirmed, I commit to doing everything in my power to 
protect the health and safety of our team members and their families. 
They will know that this is a priority of mine both from my words and 
my actions.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
               to Yohannes Abraham by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. The CCP is fostering closer economic ties with ASEAN, and 
its military is seeking to negotiate access agreements with ASEAN 
countries. Last month, we saw an official ceremony giving the People's 
Liberation Army control of the Ream Naval facility in Cambodia. The PLA 
is continuing to increase its military-to-military relations with 
Thailand and Burma.

   Is CCP engagement with ASEAN a threat to the United States? Please 
        explain.

    Answer. The next 10 years will be the decisive decade in the 
competition between the United States and People's Republic of China 
(PRC). The United States has a positive, affirmative vision for ASEAN 
and the region, rooted in common interests, opportunities, and 
challenges. At the same time, I am clear-eyed that coercive and 
nontransparent activity by the PRC, such as its actions in the South 
China Sea, pose a challenge to that vision. If confirmed, I will 
continue to support our allies and partners in ASEAN in upholding 
regional stability and the rules-based international order. I will also 
encourage regular communication and coordination with ASEAN on 
addressing common security concerns, including the PRC's increasingly 
provocative activities in the South China Sea and the Mekong.

    Question. Does the Chinese Communist Party pose a threat to the 
United States? Please explain.

    Answer. The most serious long-term challenge to the rules-based 
international order, which is a source of stability and opportunity for 
the United States and for countries around the world, is the People's 
Republic of China (PRC). The next ten years will be the decisive decade 
in the competition between the United States and the PRC. This 
challenge will define the coming decades and will shape the kind of 
world we leave behind. If confirmed, I will help advance the Biden-
Harris administration's comprehensive, whole-of-government strategy to 
compete responsibly with the PRC while highlighting our shared, 
positive, affirmative vision with allies and partners.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you encourage greater military 
cooperation between the U.S. and ASEAN?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the Department of Defense to 
deepen U.S. security engagement with ASEAN, including through the 
annual ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting Plus (ADMM+). If confirmed, I 
will also encourage regular communication and coordination with ASEAN 
states on upholding freedom of navigation and promoting adherence to 
international law in the South China Sea. If confirmed, I will also 
work with the U.S. Coast Guard to support robust implementation of 
their announced plan to expand maritime cooperation, training, and 
capacity-building in Southeast Asia, including by prioritizing the 
transfer of decommissioned cutters to coastal ASEAN nations to increase 
their maritime law enforcement capacity and promote a free and open 
Pacific.
    If confirmed, I will also support ongoing U.S. cooperation with 
ASEAN, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), and member states to enhance 
regional and country-level resiliency against terrorist attacks; share 
best practices in countering terrorism and violent extremism; develop 
national action plans; and build capacity to counter terrorist 
activities, networks, and travel.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you use your participation at 
ASEAN fora to raise concerns about the consequences of the PLA 
establishing a military presence in the region?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will use my platform to raise concerns 
regarding the impact that an expanded PRC military presence in the 
region would have on regional security. The PRC has shown a pattern of 
offering opaque, nontransparent deals. If confirmed, I would raise 
concerns about these sorts of arrangements, including specifically 
raising concerns about the Ream Naval Base. I would also raise 
concerns, publicly and privately, about the PRC's actions in the South 
China Sea and how they threaten ASEAN member states' livelihoods, food 
security, biodiversity, and energy security. If confirmed, I will also 
support whole-of-government U.S. efforts to bolster effective maritime 
governance and security capabilities in the South China Sea, including 
through improving the effectiveness of defense and maritime law 
enforcement agencies.

    Question. For most of its history, ASEAN has followed what it calls 
the ``ASEAN way,'' where decisions are made by consensus and individual 
members refrain from commenting on the internal affairs of other 
members. Last year, we saw nine of ASEAN's ten members break with this 
tradition by signing a statement condemning the military coup in Burma. 
Is ASEAN's Burma statement a sign of the group's greater willingness to 
hold members accountable to minimum basic standards of democracy and 
human rights?

    Answer. ASEAN continues to call for the regime to swiftly implement 
the Five-Point Consensus, cease violence, release all unjustly detained 
prisoners, and allow unhindered humanitarian access. If confirmed, I 
intend to continue our close consultations with ASEAN, including 
efforts to press Burma to implement the ASEAN Five-Point Consensus. 
Their continued alignment on Burma is important, as are the precedents 
they have set in dealing with Burma since last year's coup; if 
confirmed, I would look to build on both. More broadly, if confirmed, I 
will pursue whole-of-government efforts to build ASEAN's own capacity 
to take meaningful action on other human rights and humanitarian 
issues.

    Question. On what other issues do you believe ASEAN members are 
willing to work together to hold individual members accountable?

    Answer. ASEAN member states share a mutual interest in maintaining 
peace and stability, unimpeded lawful commerce, and respect for 
international law including freedoms of navigation and overflight, and 
other lawful maritime activities, including in the South China Sea. If 
confirmed, I will encourage ASEAN members to hold each other 
accountable to these and other shared interests.
    If confirmed, I will also encourage ASEAN and ASEAN members to lift 
their voices on key global issues. In the wake of Russia's unprovoked 
further invasion of Ukraine, many ASEAN members supported the immediate 
response from the U.N. General Assembly that condemned Russia's 
actions. At the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit, ASEAN leaders endorsed the 
principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty as they relate to 
Ukraine. If confirmed, I will seek to build on this foundation.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
               to Yohannes Abraham by Senator Todd Young

    Question. Do you believe that ASEAN has maximized its power with 
regards to Burma, both in response to the genocide against the Rohingya 
and last year's coup?

    Answer. ASEAN has taken a number of steps in the wake of last 
year's coup in Burma, including restricting Burma's participation in 
high-level meetings to a non-political representative and pressing for 
the regime to swiftly implement the Five-Point Consensus, cease 
violence, release all unjustly detained prisoners, and allow unhindered 
humanitarian access. That said, more can and should be done. If 
confirmed, I will work with colleagues and counterparts around the 
region on ways to increase pressure on the regime to implement the Five 
Point Consensus, change its calculus, and return Burma to a path to 
multiparty democracy.
    While some ASEAN members have voiced concerns regarding the 
military's brutal attacks on Rohingya, it is also clear that more 
should be done to hold the military accountable and support Rohingya 
refugees in the region. If confirmed, I will encourage ASEAN members to 
undertake focused action to address the genocide against the Rohingya.

    Question. What steps do you believe ASEAN can take, especially with 
Cambodia as the current chair, to exert pressure on the junta, and how 
will you seek to clarify U.S. policy on need to restore the duly 
elected government?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work closely with ASEAN to maintain 
their alignment around the need for swift implementation of the Five-
Point Consensus, as well as the precedent they set in not seating a 
political representative from the regime in key leader-level meetings. 
If confirmed, I will encourage ASEAN members to exert further pressure 
on the military regime. If confirmed, I will also encourage ASEAN 
members to meet with the NUG and other representatives of the pro-
democracy movement, and I will leverage my platform to promote accurate 
information about regime activities in the information space. If 
confirmed, I will use public and private forums to make clear that the 
United States condemns the military's actions and urges the military 
regime to reverse course; release all those unjustly detained, 
including democratic political leaders, labor leaders, journalists, 
civil society advocates, and foreign citizens; allow unhindered 
humanitarian access; and engage in meaningful dialogue that 
acknowledges the will of the people of Burma, and not the will of a 
handful of military leaders and those that benefit financially from 
them.

    Question. As we face serious competition with China, our goal in 
the Indo-Pacific should be to bolster economic relationships, reduce 
the region's dependence on Chinese exports, and provide security-
related commitments. How to you plan to provide the support needed to 
help ASEAN leaders maneuver in the face of a rising China?

    Answer. We are in the decisive decade as it relates to the 
strategic competition with the PRC. The United States has a positive, 
affirmative vision for ASEAN and the region, rooted in common 
interests, opportunities, and challenges. At the same time, I am clear-
eyed about the challenge that the PRC poses to our vision. If 
confirmed, I will work with ASEAN to ensure it is in the driver's seat 
in its relationship with the PRC.
    If confirmed, I will continue orienting U.S.-ASEAN engagement 
around deepening our longstanding cooperation, pursuing new avenues of 
dialogue, investing in our countries, driving inclusive prosperity in 
this critical region, and upholding the rules-based international 
order. As an example, if confirmed, I will work with the U.S. Coast 
Guard to support robust implementation of their announced plan to 
expand maritime cooperation, training, and capacity-building in 
Southeast Asia, including by prioritizing the transfer of 
decommissioned cutters to coastal ASEAN nations to increase their 
maritime law enforcement capacity and promote a free and open Pacific.

    Question. How do you expect to be involved in trade relations to 
bolster our economic commitments in the region?

    Answer. Economic engagement with the Indo-Pacific broadly, and 
ASEAN specifically, is critical to advancing our economic prosperity 
and national security interests, as well as those of our allies and 
partners. This year, President Biden launched the Indo-Pacific Economic 
Framework (IPEF), aimed at enabling the U.S. and our allies and 
partners to deepen our economic engagement, drive inclusive prosperity 
in the United States and throughout the Indo-Pacific, and set the rules 
on critical 21st century economic challenges and opportunities. If 
confirmed, I would work closely with Congress, my bilateral colleagues 
across the region, and my colleagues in D.C. to achieve high-ambition 
outcomes in the discussions under each pillar of IPEF.
    In addition to IPEF, the United States has advanced our trade 
relationship with the ASEAN economic ministers through the 2006 ASEAN-
United States Trade and Investment Framework Arrangement, a United 
States Trade Representative-led forum. Through this forum, the U.S. 
Government engages closely with ASEAN to advance cooperation in the 
areas of labor, environment, trade facilitation, intellectual property 
standards, the digital economy, competition, agriculture, 
biotechnology, transparency, and good regulatory practices, among other 
issues. If confirmed, I will support this forum and continue to 
strengthen our economic relationships with ASEAN by engaging with a 
broad array of stakeholders. I look forward to deepening economic 
engagement between the U.S. and ASEAN, if confirmed.

    Question. Does the Administration envision providing greater market 
access to ASEAN countries? If not, what are the meaningful benefits we 
hope to provide ASEAN countries to counter what China is proposing, via 
initiatives such as RCEP?

    Answer. President Biden has been clear about his commitment to 
deepen our economic relationships with our partners in the Indo-Pacific 
region. For example, through IPEF, the Administration will pursue trade 
facilitation and close collaboration on supply chain resilience, as 
well as the creation of a common set of rules, including in the digital 
economy. Working together to write the rules of the road in a way that 
is good for American workers, as well as for the people of the region, 
will create opportunities to deepen our economic engagement that is 
meaningful and beneficial for all involved. In addition to deepening 
our economic engagement, the Administration is partnering with ASEAN 
and ASEAN nations on a range of other shared interests and challenges. 
These mutually beneficial efforts address meaningful issues and help 
strengthen our partnership.
    If confirmed, I would work closely with Congress, colleagues around 
the Administration, and my counterparts in the region to deepen our 
mutually beneficial partnership with ASEAN and ASEAN nations across a 
range of issues, including by supporting progress on IPEF negotiations 
and other economic initiatives.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
           to Richard Lee Buangan by Senator Robert Menendez

    Question. If you are confirmed, what will be your priorities in 
Ulaanbaatar? What is the current status of the U.S. bilateral 
relationship with Mongolia?

    Answer. Our bilateral relationship with Mongolia is strong and 
growing stronger. If confirmed, I will prioritize U.S. policies and 
initiatives that support Mongolia's democratic institutions, civil 
society, and open market economy, and which promote our shared values 
in areas such as respect for human rights and the rule of law. I will 
work to increase economic and trade ties between our two countries, 
support efforts to continue expanding Mongolia's already impressive 
U.N. peacekeeping operations capability, and I will strive to help 
Mongolia rebuild its aging infrastructure and begin the transition to a 
clean energy future.

    Question. Corruption and human rights remain issues of significance 
in Mongolia. How do you plan to approach Mongolia's leadership on these 
key problems?

    Answer. My understanding is that Mongolia generally respects human 
rights, but we do have concerns about criminal libel laws, governmental 
corruption, crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or intersex persons, and 
forced child labor. If confirmed, I commit to lead the U.S. Embassy in 
Ulaanbaatar to consistently address these issues at all appropriate 
levels within Mongolia's government and civil society, and I personally 
will ensure frank and candid conversations with Mongolia's senior 
decision makers on taking steps to strengthen their commitment to 
addressing corruption and human rights issues.

    Question. How do you plan to approach the issue of reliance on 
their economies and energy security, and what opportunities exist for 
the United States to strengthen our bilateral relationship?

    Answer. I share your concern, and if confirmed, I will prioritize 
programs and assistance designed to help Mongolia diversify its economy 
and energy sources and achieve energy independence from Russia and the 
PRC. If confirmed, I will strive to help Mongolia strengthen its aging 
energy infrastructure and begin the transition to a clean energy 
future.

            to Richard Lee Buangan by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 Trafficking in Persons 
Report, Mongolia remained on Tier 2 for its ongoing efforts to meet the 
minimum standards to eliminate trafficking but did not adequately do so 
in a few key areas, including failing to appropriately identify male 
victims and appropriately penalize child sex traffickers. How will you 
work with the Mongolian Government to address these issues if you are 
confirmed as Ambassador?

   The office of the Ambassador-at-Large to monitor and combat 
        trafficking in persons plays a key role in assisting regional 
        Ambassadors in promoting anti-trafficking work. Please 
        describe, in detail and with concrete steps, how you can work 
        with the Ambassador-at-Large to improve Mongolia's anti-
        trafficking work in country.

    Answer. If confirmed, as Ambassador, I will be committed to working 
closely with the Ambassador-at-Large to improve Mongolia's anti-
trafficking efforts. It is my understanding that, overall, the 
Mongolian Government has taken positive steps to combat trafficking. If 
confirmed, I will work with Mongolian officials to continue their 
efforts to increase investigations, prosecutions, and convictions--
particularly of labor cases; create specialized trafficking prosecutor 
positions; and increase victim identification and protection. 
Furthermore, I will strive to ensure full implementation of the $5.5 
million Child Protection Compact.

    Question. In 2019, the U.S. and Mongolian Government entered a 
Child Protection Compact Partnership to increase Mongolia's anti-
trafficking work. Can you please provide your assessment of the 
progress made thus far in this compact?

    Answer. It is my understanding that the Compact has helped Mongolia 
improve its anti-trafficking work, including through the recent 
establishment of Mongolia's first anti-trafficking Multidisciplinary 
Task Force, the creation of child-friendly spaces in police stations, 
and by providing significant training to law enforcement officials.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, governmental and societal respect for religious freedom 
in Mongolia was generally lacking, including increased registration 
difficulties for various faith groups, negative public sentiment about 
``foreigners'' and other behaviors. What is your assessment of this 
particular issue and if confirmed, how will you work with the 
Ambassador-at-Large to bolster religious freedom in-country?

    Answer. The Governments of the United States and Mongolia share 
deeply rooted values, including respect for freedom of religion or 
belief. If confirmed, I will continue to encourage religious groups and 
government authorities to work together to ensure respect for religious 
freedom. I will ensure U.S. Embassy officials continue to discuss 
religious freedom concerns with the highest levels of the Mongolian 
Government and that we meet regularly with religious leaders.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 Human Rights Report, 
Mongolia was noted as having several significant human rights abuses, 
including serious government corruption and forced child labor. It was 
noted the Government did take some steps to address these issues. If 
confirmed, what steps will you take to continue to address these 
instances with the host government?

    Answer. My understanding is that Mongolia generally respects human 
rights, but we do have concerns about criminal libel laws, governmental 
corruption, crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting 
LGBTQI+ persons, and forced child labor. If confirmed, I commit to lead 
the U.S. Embassy in Ulaanbaatar to consistently address these issues at 
all appropriate levels within Mongolia's Government and civil society, 
and I personally will ensure frank and candid conversations with 
Mongolia's senior decision makers on taking steps to address corruption 
and human rights issues.

    Question. How will you direct your Embassy to work with civil 
society organizations to improve the human rights situation on the 
ground?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue U.S. policies and initiatives 
that support Mongolia's democratic institutions, civil society, and 
open market economy, and which promote our shared values in areas such 
as respect for human rights and rule of law. In particular, I will work 
with civil society organizations to develop and foster a culture of 
volunteerism and philanthropy in order to encourage civic participation 
and strengthen the Mongolian people's faith in their democratic 
institutions.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to personally raising human 
rights issues with the Mongolian Government?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I will commit to personally raising 
human rights issues with the Mongolian Government.

State Department Manangement And Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Ulaanbaatar?

    Answer. I understand that morale has been good despite the 
challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and Ulaanbaatar's isolated 
location, traffic concerns, and high pollution. The Embassy hosts a 
growing number of agencies--including MCC, USAID, DoD, Treasury, and 
Peace Corps--and the country team maintains high levels of 
collaboration and teamwork.
    If confirmed, I will lead Mission Mongolia by example and 
prioritize taking care of our people and their families.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission 
Ulaanbaatar?

    Answer. Given the overall high morale at Mission Ulaanbaatar, 
specific issues remain that could be improved. For example, if 
confirmed, I will work with our Embassy management team and Overseas 
Building Operations (OBO) to support quick progress on construction of 
a new Embassy compound to replace the current outdated and cramped 
facility. Additionally, we will work with the Office of Overseas 
Schools to seek continuous improvement to the International School of 
Ulaanbaatar to ensure a widening of educational opportunities for U.S. 
Government dependents based in Mongolia.
    If confirmed, I will prioritize taking care of our people and their 
families. I will personally take a strong interest in the welfare and 
wellbeing of our Mission colleagues and lead with purpose to inspire 
pride in our work. I will also ask the Embassy's senior leaders and 
section chiefs to prioritize work-life balance and professional 
development for both American and Locally Employed staff.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Ulaanbaatar?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to working closely with and 
empowering the country team to ensure we maintain high levels of 
collaboration and teamwork. It will be a priority for me to communicate 
frequently and broadly to the Embassy workforce, as well as host 
periodic town halls and community-wide events to synchronize our 
efforts. I will encourage all employees to familiarize themselves with 
key aspects of our vision documents, particularly the Integrated 
Country Strategy and Mission Resource Request.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I believe in being an inclusive manager and encouraging 
everyone to perform to the best of their abilities. I integrate 
coaching and mentoring as part of my leadership ethos. Open 
communication and active listening are a central part of my management 
style. I encourage information sharing and collaboration, especially 
across the USG interagency represented at the Embassy. I also believe 
in fostering a diverse and inclusive working environment so everyone 
can feel valued as part of the community. As our work normalizes and 
adjusts post-pandemic, I believe in ensuring our teams have the right 
tools to work collaboratively, in person or virtually. If confirmed, I 
look forward to learning from the experiences and perspectives of the 
Mission Ulaanbaatar team.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. I am strongly opposed to berating mission employees, either 
in public or private. If confirmed, I will treat all members of the 
Mission Ulaanbaatar community with respect and dignity. When State 
Department performance reviews are required, I will conduct these with 
the goal of recognizing strong performance and helping every member of 
the team realize their potential. Our people are our most important 
asset, and if confirmed, I will do everything in my power to support 
and encourage our personnel to be the best they can be.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. As an inclusive manager, if confirmed, I will strive to 
build a close, consultative relationship based on mutual respect that 
will empower my Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) to ensure the smooth 
functioning of Mission Ulaanbaatar. I will hold myself accountable for 
ensuring my DCM has the right information and resources to do their job 
effectively as a senior member of the Embassy team. I will also provide 
appropriate professional development and growth opportunities to 
prepare my DCM for higher positions of responsibility in future 
assignments.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will rely on my DCM's knowledge of 
Department policies and procedures to ensure that Mission Ulaanbaatar 
is well-run and appropriately resourced to achieve our foreign policy 
priorities. I will also appropriately delegate and empower my DCM to 
make decisions to ensure efficient Embassy operations that prioritize 
results and taking care of our people.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking. Do 
you believe that it is important to provide employees with accurate, 
constructive feedback on their performances in order to encourage 
improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their roles?

    Answer. I believe that accurate, constructive feedback is important 
at all levels, and if confirmed, I will be forthright with my staff 
because honesty and transparency foster strong relationships and help 
to establish clear performance expectations. This means recognizing and 
rewarding those who are succeeding in their roles, as well as providing 
constructive feedback to help all employees develop the skills needed 
to achieve their potential. I will hold myself and my team to the 
highest standards and ensure we are accountable at all levels.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes. I believe that accurate, constructive feedback is 
important at all levels. If confirmed, I will provide clear, accurate, 
and direct feedback to my staff because honesty and transparency foster 
strong relationships and help to establish clear performance 
expectations. This means recognizing and rewarding those who are 
succeeding in their roles, as well as providing constructive feedback 
to help all employees develop the skills needed to achieve their 
potential. I will hold myself and my team to the highest standards and 
ensure we are accountable at all levels.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Mongolia. In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our Embassy 
walls enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. Given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic around the 
world, it has been exceptionally tough for U.S. diplomats to get 
outside the Embassy walls and engage with local actors. However, over 
the course of my foreign service career, I have continually been 
impressed by the way U.S. diplomats strive to develop a deep knowledge 
and understanding of the countries in which we serve. The most 
successful diplomats engage directly with the community, learn the 
local cultures and languages, and get to know a wide range of people. 
Such relationships are critical to our work advancing U.S. priorities 
overseas and managing bilateral ties.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will encourage members of Mission community 
to engage with host country nationals. Mongolia is a vast country with 
a rich history that has undergone significant democratic and economic 
development over the past 30 years. It is important that we get out and 
meet people in all parts of the country, listen to their stories, and 
understand the diverse challenges and opportunities they face, from the 
rapidly growing capital to the rural countryside.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in 
Mongolia?

    Answer. It is my understanding that there is a vibrant and active 
public diplomacy environment in Mongolia. If confirmed, I will work to 
expand and strengthen our already very strong people-to-people ties, 
which are deep and form the basis of our strategic partnership.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. It is my understanding that our public diplomacy efforts in 
Mongolia prioritize building media literacy and supporting efforts to 
counter disinformation, particularly from Russia and the PRC. The 
continuous stream of disinformation is a challenge to our public 
diplomacy efforts, but we use our programs and messages to continually 
demonstrate the United States' respect for Mongolian culture, identity, 
democracy, and independence.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the team at Mission 
Ulaanbaatar to understand and support the Mission's crucial role in 
formulating public diplomacy programs and responses. Our staff on the 
ground in Mongolia bring an incredible range of expertise and local 
insight to the Mission. If confirmed, I will ensure that our public 
diplomacy professionals in Washington and Ulaanbaatar continue to work 
closely together, and that we draw on that local expertise to ensure 
our global public diplomacy messages are relevant and effective for our 
Mongolian audiences.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel. The past occurrences and ongoing threat of anomalous 
health incidents among Embassy personnel and their families poses a 
serious challenge to morale. When personnel at post fear for their 
safety or doubt that their case will be taken seriously if they were 
affected, the performance of Embassy operations can suffer.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. I am deeply concerned by potential anomalous health 
incidents affecting government personnel and their family members. 
These incidents affect the wellbeing of U.S. personnel serving their 
country abroad and must be taken extremely seriously. If confirmed, the 
health, safety, and security of Embassy staff, their family members, 
and all those supporting the Mission will be my highest priority.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Ulaanbaatar personnel?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will commit to ensuring all reported 
incidents at Embassy Ulaanbaatar are treated seriously and quickly 
reported through the appropriate medical and investigatory channels, 
and to sharing information to the extent permitted by applicable law 
and investigatory procedures.

    Question. Have you received a briefing on the anomalous health 
incidents that have occurred to U.S. Government personnel around the 
world, including at U.S. embassies and other diplomatic posts? If you 
have not, and if you are confirmed, do you commit to receiving a 
briefing on the incidents before you depart for your post?

    Answer. I have received a briefing on the anomalous health 
incidents that have affected U.S. Government personnel and their family 
members around the world. If confirmed, I commit to seeking additional 
briefings at the appropriate classification levels before my departure 
to post and learning how I can best protect all Embassy personnel and 
their family members and respond to any future incidents.

    Question. In the event of an anomalous health incident among your 
Embassy personnel or eligible family members, do you commit to maintain 
detailed records of the incident, and share the information with the 
State Department and other embassies to contribute to the investigation 
of how these attacks are affecting U.S. missions and personnel around 
the world?

    Answer. Yes, I commit to sharing information to the extent 
permitted by the Rehabilitation Act and other applicable laws.

    Question. Whether or not anomalous health incidents occur at your 
Embassy, how will you work to restore and preserve morale that may be 
lost due to the knowledge these attacks have been occurring at posts 
around the world?

    Answer. In the event an anomalous health incident (AHI) is 
reported, I will do everything possible to ensure that anyone affected 
receives immediate and appropriate attention and care and that the 
incident is reported through appropriate channels. I would keep the 
Mission informed to the extent permitted by law. I understand there is 
an extensive, ongoing interagency investigation to identify the 
possible causes of AHIs, and I am committed to supporting this 
investigation.

             to Richard Lee Buangan by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. Since emerging from the shadow of communism more than 30 
years ago, Mongolia's young democracy has followed a ``Third Neighbor'' 
policy, where it seeks close relations with the United States to 
counter the influence of its two immediate neighbors: China and Russia. 
If Mongolia is dominated by the CCP's influence, is that a threat to 
U.S. interests? Please explain.

    Answer. If confirmed, my goal as Ambassador will be to strengthen 
Mongolia's independence, and to support the Mongolian people in 
building a strong, resilient democratic system and a prosperous, 
private sector-driven economy that can play a constructive role in the 
international community and withstand pressure or coercive actions from 
the People's Republic of China. I believe it is not in the interest of 
either the Mongolian people or the United States for an outside force 
or country to intimidate or threaten Mongolia.

    Question. Does the Chinese Communist Party pose a threat to the 
United States? Please explain.

    Answer. As Secretary Blinken said in May, the PRC is the only 
country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, 
increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological 
power to do it.
    We are prepared to work together with Beijing where our interests 
intersect, where it is essential for global peace and prosperity and to 
keep lines of communication open.

    Question. Can Mongolia's third neighbor policy serve as a model for 
other countries susceptible to foreign influence from Russia and China?

    Answer. It is my understanding that through its ``Third Neighbor'' 
policy, the people and Government of Mongolia seek to develop strong 
ties with the United States and the West while maintaining a balanced, 
cordial relationship with Russia and the PRC. This pragmatic foreign 
policy has served Mongolia for decades, and it may be a model for other 
countries susceptible to pressure from Russia and the PRC.

    Question. If so, what should the U.S. do to be a good ``third 
neighbor'' to these countries?

    Answer. Much like what we do in Mongolia, I believe the United 
States could pursue policies that support democracies in the Indo-
Pacific by strengthening their democratic institutions, civil society, 
and free press as well as promote open market economies. We must also 
remain true to promoting fundamental values in areas such as respect 
for human rights, religious freedom, and rule of law.

    Question. Despite this Third Neighbor Policy, Mongolia remains 
economically dependent on Russia and China for most of its imports and 
exports. I, along with other Senators on this committee, have 
cosponsored the Mongolia Third Neighbor Trade Act to chip away at this 
dominance. In your assessment, would the Mongolia Third Neighbor Trade 
Act reduce Mongolian dependence on the Russian and Chinese economies?

    Answer. I welcome the role the Congress plays in helping to provide 
our Indo-Pacific allies and partners, including Mongolia, with 
resources and tools to diminish the dependency these countries have on 
Russia and the PRC. If confirmed, I would support efforts to help the 
Mongolian people build a prosperous economy, capable of withstanding 
pressure from its authoritarian neighbors.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to support enhancing 
economic ties between our two countries?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will prioritize enhancing economic ties 
between our two countries by seeking opportunities to promote foreign 
direct investment in Mongolia, stressing the importance of full 
implementation of the U.S.-Mongolia Agreement on Transparency in 
Matters Related to International Trade and Investment; supporting the 
activities and programs of Millennium Challenge Corporation, the U.S. 
International Development Finance Corporation and USAID; and working 
closely with AmCham Mongolia.

efforts to do so. Areas where Fiji could improve include increasing 
services to sex trafficking victims and increasing convictions. How 
will you work with the Fijian Government to address these issues if you 
are confirmed as Ambassador?

    Answer. As I understand, U.S. Embassy Suva did significant outreach 
to the Fijian Government to address issues raised the Trafficking in 
Persons Report. If confirmed, I will continue with our outreach efforts 
to help Fiji improve its anti-trafficking efforts, including by helping 
the Government to find methods to improve the effectiveness anti-

discrimination against all individuals based on religious identity, 
practice or believed, worldwide. The United States continues to support 
freedom of religion, including bundled rights such as freedom of 
expression, assembly, and association, including during the COVID-19

respect both for freedom of religion or belief as well as for public 
health guidelines.

    Question. If confirmed, what steps will you take to continue to 
address these instances with the host government?

    Answer. As a global policy, the U.S. Government advocates for

commit to lead the U.S. Embassy Suva to consistently address these 
issues at all appropriate levels within Fiji's Government and civil

    Answer. The Kiribati constitution provides for freedom of 
conscience (including religion), expression, assembly, and association. 
If confirmed, I will regularly engage civil society, including members 
of religious communities, and, along with the Ambassador-at-Large, will 
advocate for religious freedom and respect for the rights of all with 
the Kiribati Government.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 Human Rights Report, 
Kiribati was noted as having several significant human rights abuses,

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, Tonga has a mix of religious groups but the Forum of 
Church Leaders only includes Christian leaders. What is your assessment 
of this particular issue and if confirmed, how will you work with the 
Ambassador-at-Large to bolster religious freedom in-country?

    Answer. The Department of State monitors reports of abuses and 
discrimination against all individuals based on religious identity, 
practice or believed, worldwide. The United States continues to support 
freedom of religion, including bundled rights such as freedom of 
expression, assembly, and association, including during the COVID-19 
pandemic. If confirmed, I will continue to advocate for religious 
freedom and encourage government authorities to work closely with civil 
society, including members of religious groups, in order to ensure 
respect both for freedom of religion or belief as well as for public 
health guidelines.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 Human Rights Report, Tonga 
was noted as having several significant human rights issues included 
credible reports of serious government corruption and the existence of 
law criminalizing consensual same-sex sexual conduct between adults. If 
confirmed, what steps will you take to continue to address these 
instances with the host government?

    Answer. As a global policy, the U.S. Government advocates for 
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. If confirmed, I 
commit to lead U.S. Embassy Suva to consistently address these issues 
at all appropriate levels within Tonga's Government and civil society.

    Question. How will you direct your Embassy to work with civil 
society organizations to improve the human rights situation on the 
ground?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would direct U.S. Embassy Suva employees to 
continue to work with civil society partners in the Tonga to raise 
awareness, highlight abuses and violations, and promote respect for 
human rights in Tonga.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to personally raising human 
rights issues with the Government of Tonga?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to raising human rights issues with 
the Government of Tonga.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, there were reports of restrictions on non-state 
religion and lack of religious pluralism and tolerance in Tuvalu. What 
is your assessment of this particular issue and if confirmed, how will 
you work with the Ambassador-at-Large to bolster religious freedom in-
country?

    Answer. The Department of State monitors reports of abuses and 
discrimination against all individuals based on religious identity, 
practice or believed, worldwide. The United States continues to support 
freedom of religion, including bundled rights such as freedom of 
expression, assembly, and association, including during the COVID-19 
pandemic. If confirmed, I will continue to advocate for religious 
freedom and encourage government authorities to work closely with civil 
society, including members of religious groups, in order to ensure 
respect both for freedom of religion or belief as well as for public 
health guidelines.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 Human Rights Report, 
Tuvalu was noted as having several significant human rights issues 
including credible reports of existence of laws criminalizing 
consensual same-sex sexual activities between men, although the laws 
were not enforced. If confirmed, what steps will you take to continue 
to address these instances with the host government?

    Answer. As a global policy, the U.S. Government advocates for 
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. If confirmed, I 
commit to lead the U.S. Embassy Suva to consistently address these 
issues at all appropriate levels within Tuvalu's Government and civil 
society.

    Question. How will you direct your Embassy to work with civil 
society organizations to improve the human rights situation on the 
ground?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would direct U.S. Embassy Suva employees to 
continue to work with civil society partners in the Tuvalu to raise 
awareness, highlight abuses and violations, and promote respect for 
human rights in Tuvalu.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to personally raising human 
rights issues with the Government of Tuvalu?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to raising human rights issues with 
the Government of Tuvalu.

    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Suva?

    Answer. My understanding is morale in Fiji has been good under the 
leadership of Charge Greubel after U.S. Embassy Suva weathered a 
difficult 2020. I don't know any specifics, but like many of our 
missions overseas, employees in the Fiji faced the full gamut of COVID-
19 mitigation protocols, quarantine requirements, and travel 
disruptions due to COVID-19 restrictions. If confirmed, I would 
prioritize the health, safety, security, and morale of all employees in 
the Mission.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Suva?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to working closely with the 
senior leadership team to understand and address any issues affecting 
morale. I prioritize the care of my team, both American and local 
staff, to ensure they have the tools to succeed in the workplace. The 
challenges of COVID-19 over the last two years have underscored the 
very real need to care for our people. It is a privilege to lead such a 
dedicated group of individuals, and I am committed to creating an 
inclusive workplace environment that puts the safety and well-being of 
our teams first.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Suva?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will start by listening to the experienced 
staff and personnel to learn from their experiences and perspectives. I 
will work with my senior staff to develop a shared vision of Mission 
priorities. I will clearly communicate the foreign policy priorities of 
this administration and facilitate regular conversations with both 
American and local staff to ensure clear communication and 
coordination.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I am an inclusive manager. I find that teams work best when 
you take care of them. This means you actively listen to them to 
understand their needs and find ways to support them so they can be 
successful at their jobs.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. It is never acceptable to berate subordinates, either 
publicly or privately. If confirmed, I will commit to treat all members 
of the Mission Suva community with respect and dignity. I believe in 
helping my team understand their areas of development and their areas 
of strength. Our people are our most important asset, and if confirmed, 
I will do everything in my power to support and encourage our personnel 
to be the best they can be.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. I have an inclusive leadership style, and I expect to have 
a collaborative relationship with my Deputy Chief of Mission built on 
mutual respect. I will look to empower my Deputy Chief of Mission to 
ensure Mission Suva functions smoothly.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will rely on my Deputy Chief of Mission to 
navigate the Department's policies and procedures to ensure we are 
properly resourced to achieve our foreign policy objectives.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking. Do 
you believe that it is important to provide employees with accurate, 
constructive feedback on their performances in order to encourage 
improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their roles?

    Answer. It is imperative to provide employees with accurate, 
constructive feedback on their performance in order to encourage 
improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their roles. If 
confirmed, I will commit to fostering an open and inclusive environment 
where employees will receive both the support and candid feedback they 
deserve to help them achieve their peak performance capabilities.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. To ensure all employees can achieve their highest level of 
performance, they must receive clear, accurate, direct, and regular 
feedback. If confirmed, I will strive to build strong relationships 
with them, which entails clear and transparent communication about 
expectations. High achievers should be recognized and rewarded. All 
employees should expect and demand the opportunity to develop the 
skills necessary to achieve their potential.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
the Pacific Islands. In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of 
our Embassy walls enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. U.S. Embassy Suva faces some unique challenges because it 
covers five countries from our physical location in Suva. The pandemic 
closed international borders and adversely impacted our ability to 
visit to each of the countries our mission covers. If confirmed, I will 
prioritize getting our people regularly back out in the field to all 
five of the countries covered by U.S. Embassy Suva.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. Pacific islanders highly value in-person interactions. For 
that reason, it is imperative to get our staff out in the field as 
often as possible to interact with the local populations. If confirmed, 
I will work with mission members to get out into the field, including 
all five of our countries, to ensure we are reaching all of the local 
populations to the best of our ability.

    Question. What is the public diplomacy environment like in the 
Pacific Islands?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work to expand and strengthen the 
people-to-people ties between the United States and the Pacific Island 
countries. While our Pacific neighbors gravitate toward us based on 
common values and shared history, we cannot take those factors for 
granted. Younger age groups on Pacific Islands may not have the same 
memory of World War II as older generations do. The People's Republic 
of China (PRC) is actively engaging in-person in many of the countries 
where we are not physically present, including Kiribati and Tonga. We 
need to continue to strengthen our ties to the region, including the 
promotion of a broad range of interests based upon our shared values of 
democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Diaspora ties are also 
highly important between the United States and Pacific Island 
countries.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. Pacific societies place high value on face-to-face 
contacts, which has been nearly impossible for many Pacific Island 
countries during the pandemic. When diplomats show up in person, it not 
only shows U.S. commitment to engaging more with Pacific Island 
countries, it also builds up the personal contacts and networks that 
are vital for advancing American interests with Pacific partners.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. As I understand it, U.S. Embassy Suva has a crucial role in 
formulating public diplomacy programs and responses. The Public Affairs 
Section (PAS) has a staff of Americans and Pacific Islanders who 
provide expertise and local insight. There are many areas where PAS 
works directly with different offices and bureaus at Main State. For 
example, the PAS Press Section handles all relations between the 
Embassy and the local media. It also coordinates with other missions in 
the region and Main State on high-level visits or issues which attract 
international attention (such as the recent seizure of the Russian 
superyacht Amadea). PAS works closely with Main State on such 
initiatives as Fulbright, Sports Diplomacy, and the Young Pacific 
Leaders Program.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel. The past occurrences and ongoing threat of anomalous 
health incidents among Embassy personnel and their families poses a 
serious challenge to morale. When personnel at post fear for their 
safety or doubt that their case will be taken seriously if they were 
affected, the performance of Embassy operations can suffer. If 
confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. I am deeply concerned by potential anomalous health 
incidents impacting U.S. Government personnel and their family members. 
These incidents affect the wellbeing of U.S. personnel serving their 
country abroad and must be taken extremely seriously. If confirmed, the 
health, safety, and security of Embassy Suva staff, their family 
members, and all those supporting the Mission will be my highest 
priority.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Suva personnel?

    Answer. The health and safety of my staff is my top priority. If 
confirmed, I will commit to ensuring all reported incidents at U.S. 
Embassy Suva are treated seriously and quickly reported through the 
appropriate medical and investigatory channels. I will ensure that any 
affected individuals receive prompt access to treatment and medical 
care. Moreover, I will ensure that they receive our support and 
empathy. If confirmed, I will also commit to work closely with medical 
staff and the Regional Security Office at Embassy Suva to discuss any 
past reported incidents (if any), openly communicate with Mission 
personnel, and ensure that all protocols are being closely followed.

    Question. Have you received a briefing on the anomalous health 
incidents that have occurred to U.S. Government personnel around the 
world, including at U.S. embassies and other diplomatic posts? If you 
have not, and if you are confirmed, do you commit to receiving a 
briefing on the incidents before you depart for your post?

    Answer. Yes. We had an anomalous health incident in Vietnam and 
later had a Town Hall meeting with the Department. If confirmed, I 
commit to receiving a briefing on the incidents before departing for my 
post. Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our 
Mission personnel and, if confirmed, I will do my upmost to understand 
the conditions under which my Mission operates and to facilitate clear 
communication with Mission members.

    Question. In the event of an anomalous health incident among your 
Embassy personnel or eligible family members, do you commit to maintain 
detailed records of the incident, and share the information with the 
State Department and other embassies to contribute to the investigation 
of how these attacks are affecting U.S. missions and personnel around 
the world?

    Answer. Yes, in the event of an anomalous health incident among my 
Embassy personnel or eligible family members, I would commit to 
maintain detailed records of the incident and to the extent permitted 
by law share information with other offices and bureaus within the 
State Department to contribute to the investigation of how these 
attacks are affecting U.S. missions and personnel around the world. 
Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our Mission 
personnel and their families.

    Question. Whether or not anomalous health incidents occur at your 
Embassy, how will you work to restore and preserve morale that may be 
lost due to the knowledge these attacks have been occurring at posts 
around the world?

    Answer. It is incumbent upon leadership to establish and maintain 
trust with the Embassy community. We build trust by maintaining the 
lines of communication, by listening to the concerns of our community 
members, and addressing those concerns as openly and clearly as 
possible.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
               to Marie C. Damour by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. This year, we saw the CCP sign a security pact with the 
Solomon Islands, which gives it access to deploy its military in a 
position that threatens U.S. and allied military facilities. In May, 
the PRC tried to negotiate a sweeping trade and security agreement with 
ten further nations. Fortunately, this broke down, but the CCP will 
undoubtedly try again. The reasons for this are clear--in a future 
confrontation with CCP, the U.S. will need facilities in the region to 
resupply and re-fit our troops, and Beijing's security pact would 
prevent this. Is CCP engagement in the Pacific Islands a threat to U.S. 
interests? Please explain.

    Answer. Our vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific excludes no 
nation. We welcome contributions to regional development, so long as 
countries adhere to high standards, including in areas such as 
transparency, rule of law, sustainable financing, social and economic 
safeguards, and respect for the autonomy of development aid recipients. 
However, as the PRC's involvement in the region has grown, we have seen 
a range of increasingly problematic behaviors, including its assertion 
of unlawful maritime claims and the ongoing militarization of disputed 
features in the South China Sea, predatory economic activities 
including illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, and 
investments that undermine good governance and promote corruption.

    Question. Does the Chinese Communist Party pose a threat to the 
United States? Please explain.

    Answer. We have profound differences with the Chinese Communist 
Party and the PRC Government. The PRC is the only country with both the 
intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the 
economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. The 
United States must defend and reform the rules-based international 
order--the system of laws, agreements, principles, and institutions 
that the world came together to build after two world wars to manage 
relations between states, to prevent conflict, to uphold the rights of 
all people. We want not just to sustain the international order that 
made so much of that progress possible but also to modernize it to make 
sure that it represents the interests, the values, the hopes of all 
nations, big and small, from every region; and furthermore, that it can 
meet the challenges that we face now and will face in the future.

    Question. What were the reasons for the breakdown in talks between 
the CCP and the ten pacific islands?

    Answer. PRC Foreign Minister Wang Yi did not do things the 
``Pacific way'' and subsequently failed to secure regional buy-in for 
his agenda. For example, he did not consult with the 10 Pacific Island 
nations and build consensus for the PRC's China-Pacific Island 
Countries Common Development Vision and a related five-year action 
plan. This is a lesson we are keeping in mind as we move forward in our 
engagement with Pacific Island nations. To ensure we build the best 
foundation for a common partnership, we have consulted and will 
continue to consult with our Pacific neighbors.

    Question. How has the U.S. fallen behind the CCP in engaging the 
Pacific Island states?

    Answer. For too long, the United States has relied on the goodwill 
and common bonds built among our countries though the World War II 
experience, but that common memory has waned, and the younger 
generation is disconnected from our shared past and too many of the 
younger generation have never interacted with an American. To change 
this narrative we must show up, listen, provide a positive alternative 
to the PRC and be visible in our programs and engagements with Pacific 
Island countries.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to ensure that the CCP 
does not gain a strategic foothold in the Pacific islands?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will do my part to significantly deepen our 
engagement in the Pacific Islands and embark on a new chapter in our 
partnership--a chapter with increased American presence where we will 
commit to work with the Pacific Islands in the short and long term to 
address the most pressing issues that they face. Following on Vice 
President Harris' speech to the Pacific Islands Forum, the United 
States will begin discussions with Kiribati and Tonga on our interest 
in establishing embassies in in those countries. If confirmed, I will 
work with interagency partners to return Peace Corps to the Pacific 
Islands and work with USAID to expand its engagement in the region.

    Question. Can you give us an update on the status of the Compact 
States negotiations?

    Answer. The Biden-Harris administration has prioritized Compact 
negotiations with the Freely Associated States (FAS) as a U.S. foreign 
policy objective. Recognizing the urgency of completing these 
negotiations, the Administration announced the appointment of 
Ambassador (retired) Joseph Yun as the Special Presidential Envoy for 
Compact Negotiations on March 22, 2022. Special Presidential Envoy for 
Compact Negotiations Joseph Yun has held in-person or virtual meetings 
with the presidents of all three FAS and has met separately with the 
lead negotiators from each nation. Negotiations with the Federated 
States of Micronesia continue to move forward and have recently 
recommenced with the Republic of Marshall Islands. Formal negotiations 
with Palau are scheduled to resume in early August. The Special 
Presidential Envoy for Compact Negotiations is leading the negotiations 
with the continuing support of the team composed of representatives of 
relevant agencies. We look forward to reaching understandings with the 
three FAS later this year on a shared vision for our strong and lasting 
relationship that benefits the entire Pacific region.

                        WEDNESDAY, JULY 27, 2022

                                       U.S. Senate,
                            Committee on Foreign Relations,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 11:39 a.m., in 
Room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Christopher 
A. Coons presiding.
    Present: Senators Coons [presiding], Shaheen, and Young.

        OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHRISTOPHER A. COONS, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM DELAWARE

    Senator Coons. This hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee will come to order.
    We are here today to consider nominees for five important 
positions in North Africa and Central Asia: Mr. Puneet Talwar 
to be Ambassador to Morocco; Joey Hood to be Ambassador to 
Tunisia; Daniel Rosenblum to be Ambassador to Kazakhstan, Dr. 
Jonathan Henick to be Ambassador to Uzbekistan; and Lesslie 
Viguerie to be Ambassador to the Kyrgyz Republic.
    Thank you, all, for your service, for your willingness to 
take on these roles, to your families and friends who are here 
supporting you.
    We are about to have two votes on the floor of the Senate. 
So I apologize in advance that my ranking member today, Senator 
Young, and I will each depart in order to keep this 
confirmation hearing moving and yet allow us to participate in 
voting on a very important piece of legislation of which 
Senator Young was the leading Republican.
    I understand Senator Shaheen will, first, be introducing 
nominee Joey Hood.
    Senator Shaheen, please proceed.

               STATEMENT OF HON. JEANNE SHAHEEN, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE

    Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member 
Young. I am delighted to be here this morning to introduce Joey 
Hood to this committee and want to congratulate all of the 
nominees who are here this morning and thank them all for their 
service to the country.
    But my primary reason for being here this morning is to 
introduce Mr. Hood, who is a career member of the Foreign 
Service. He joined the State Department in 1998 and for the 
last 25 years he has worked diligently to advance U.S. 
interests around the world.
    Yet, throughout his career, Mr. Hood has not shied away 
from hard problems. He has worked to advance human rights in 
Eritrea, to support our allies in Afghanistan and Iraq.
    He has advocated for the Yazidis and the Iraqi Christians 
as they were being persecuted by ISIS. So he has been willing 
to take on some difficult challenges.
    He has also forged strong ties with other countries and 
facilitated many congressional delegations in their work 
abroad. In fact, many on this committee, I know, as well as on 
the Armed Services Committee may know Mr. Hood from our foreign 
travel.
    I had the honor of joining him at the embassy when I was in 
Iraq in 2019 and he put on a very nice spread for us and really 
filled us in on what was happening in Iraq at the time.
    But not only is Mr. Hood a distinguished career Foreign 
Service Officer, he is a native of the great state of New 
Hampshire. Mr. Hood grew up in Hinsdale, New Hampshire, which 
is in the western part of our state. His mother drove a school 
bus and served as a substitute teacher and his father worked 
for the post office in Vermont for 40 years.
    He still owns a home in Keene and his children have joined 
the storied New Hampshire tradition of going to summer camp at 
Stonewall Farm and Camp Dakota, and I am delighted to also this 
morning be able to welcome his wife, Anna, and his children, 
Fiona and Henry, so who are both staying in New Hampshire.
    And as someone who has dedicated his life to serving the 
United States abroad, who has made the sacrifices that come 
with such service, I am so honored that he still considers New 
Hampshire his home and that he has raised a family who 
considers themselves Granite Staters.
    I urge this committee to swiftly move his nomination 
forward as well as the nominations of all of those people we 
are hearing from this morning. I look forward to continuing to 
work with him in his new role as ambassador to Tunisia once we 
do.
    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Shaheen.
    I will make a brief opening statement regarding each of the 
five nominees, then turn to my ranking member, Senator Young, 
for his opening statement. Then we will turn to each of you in 
turn for your opening statements.
    Mr. Talwar, it is a pleasure chairing your confirmation 
hearing to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Morocco. Our work 
together has been a highlight of my public service over many 
years.
    Your service as Assistant Secretary of State for Political 
Military Affairs makes you very well suited for serving in one 
of our most important regional security partners, and I look 
forward to hearing what your priorities will be for the U.S.-
Morocco relationship, if confirmed.
    Mr. Hood, a Granite Stater, you have been nominated at a 
critical moment for Tunisia, which is facing systemic attempts 
to dismantle its fledgling democracy. The shuttering of the 
parliament, the firing of judges, and the series of 
constitutional changes of consolidated presidential authority 
gravely concern me.
    You have, as Senator Shaheen just referenced, an impressive 
record of service including as Principal Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs and I look forward to 
hearing how you will respond to democratic backsliding in 
Tunisia, if confirmed.
    We also have three nominees before us for critical Central 
Asian countries at the crossroads of influence by China and 
Russia.
    If I could, Ambassador Rosenblum, I welcome your 
nomination, your previous experience as ambassador to 
Uzbekistan. I look forward to hearing how you will help 
Kazakhstan, the region's largest economy, reduce its reliance 
on Russia.
    Dr. Henick, I welcome your experience as Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs. Uzbekistan is an 
important regional leader and distributor of humanitarian aid, 
including to Afghanistan. I look forward to hearing how you 
will support Uzbekistan's desired reforms and leadership on 
humanitarian aid.
    And, finally, Mr. Viguerie, glad to see your nomination for 
Ambassador to the Kyrgyz Republic, which has until recently 
been known in Central Asia as one of the most democratic 
countries, and I know your experience as Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Central Asia and Pakistan Affairs will be 
invaluable.
    I look forward to hearing how each of you will address 
expanding PRC influence and, in your case, a faltering 
commitment to democracy.
    I will now turn to my ranking member, Senator Young of 
Indiana.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. TODD YOUNG, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM INDIANA

    Senator Young. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I, too, want to thank our five nominees today for their 
willingness and, in some cases, their continued willingness to 
serve the United States in these important positions.
    I look forward to hearing from all our nominees today on 
how they will advance American leadership and interests in 
these countries.
    Russia's invasion of Ukraine and our collective response 
have damaged its economy and demonstrated to its neighbors that 
it cannot be trusted nor depended upon.
    China's domestic COVID-19 response has similarly 
demonstrated its unreliability as an economic partner. The 
weeks-long lockdown of Shanghai showcases how the Communist 
Party would prefer to jeopardize its own growth rather than 
admit failure.
    Through this we have a unique opportunity to showcase the 
value of deepening partnerships with the United States and our 
allies in resisting the draw of these authoritarian regimes.
    Now is a crucial moment for the United States to embrace 
the collective capabilities of our allies and partners as we 
turn our attention to strategic great power competition.
    If we want to succeed in this competition we must find the 
best way forward to balance our interests while remaining the 
partner of choice for those around the globe.
    Unlike in years past, these countries have options for 
economic and security partnerships. In the case of Morocco, we 
have a continued partner looking to us as we make good on our 
commitments. I also hope to hear how we can build upon the 
success of the Abraham Accords and deepen ties between Morocco 
and Israel in addition to the United States.
    In Tunisia, the world is waiting to see the path it will 
take as well as the impact on its people and fledgling 
democratic institutions. In the case of our Central Asian 
partners, Russia's unprovoked aggression has prompted a 
wholesale reassessment of each country's relationships with 
their neighbors and beyond.
    Our task must be to enforce and uphold our standards while 
recognizing unattainable goals may drive our would-be partners 
to yield to the siren song of Chinese and Russian influence.
    We cannot ignore the need to advance our diplomatic and 
humanitarian priorities, and if our policy actions drive our 
partners into the arms of Russia and China we will be 
undercutting these very priorities.
    Our witnesses will be approaching all of these challenges 
from different perspectives, and I look forward to hearing 
their views on this conversation.
    Thank you again to our nominees for their willingness to 
serve the United States in their respective roles. I look 
forward to our discussion this morning.
    Mr. Chairman?
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Young.
    We will now hear from each of today's nominees in the order 
in which they were noticed to this committee.
    Please keep your opening remarks to no more than five 
minutes. Your written testimonies will be submitted in full to 
the record.
    First up would be Mr. Puneet Talwar.
    Puneet?

 STATEMENT OF HON. PUNEET TALWAR OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, 
NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF 
     THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO

    Mr. Talwar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for the 
kind words in your introduction. It has been a privilege to 
know you for so long and I cherish the time that I was able to 
spend in your office.
    I have to say that your tenure here in the Senate has 
really been a model of public service and your cooperation with 
the ranking member, I think, has set the gold standard for 
bipartisan cooperation.
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Young, who I know has had to 
leave for a vote, it has been an honor. It is an honor to 
return to the committee as President Biden's nominee to be the 
ambassador--U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of Morocco.
    I want to thank the President and Secretary Blinken for the 
trust and confidence in me.
    I have great respect for this committee. I have seen 
firsthand your strong commitment to advancing our national 
interests.
    If confirmed, I look forward to consulting closely with you 
and, hopefully, welcoming you when you visit.
    I am joined today by my wife, Sarosh, and my sons, Haris 
and Ilyas. My parents, brother, and sister are watching from 
home.
    Mr. Chairman, Morocco is a longstanding and valued partner. 
Indeed, it was the first country to recognize American 
independence. With a strategic location, Morocco is a bridge 
between Europe, the Mediterranean, and Africa, regions that are 
critical to American national security.
    Morocco is a leader on key regional and global issues. It 
is at the forefront of efforts to combat terrorism. It has 
taken bold steps on the climate crisis.
    Morocco is also dedicated to economic development in Africa 
and last week it hosted the U.S.-Africa Business Summit.
    I want to highlight Morocco's leadership on peace with 
Israel. The relationship between the two countries is 
blossoming. It now spans cooperation on investment, energy, 
aviation, and many other areas.
    Morocco was the first Arab country to sign a defense 
cooperation agreement with Israel, and last week the chief of 
staff of the Israel Defense Forces made a landmark visit to 
Morocco.
    In March, Morocco's foreign minister attended the inaugural 
meeting of the Negev Forum. The vision of a warm peace that has 
eluded the region for so long is finally coming into focus, 
thanks to the Abraham Accords and Morocco's growing ties with 
Israel.
    If confirmed, I will support translating that vision into 
tangible improvements in the lives of ordinary people so that 
we can expand the circle of peace, something which ultimately 
serves American interests.
    With respect to the conflict in western Sahara, last fall 
the United Nations Secretary General appointed a seasoned 
diplomat, Staffan de Mistura, as his personal envoy to work 
with the parties in a renewed push for peace.
    He is someone I have known for many years and, if 
confirmed, I will support his efforts to promote a just and 
durable political solution.
    Domestically, Morocco has an ambitious reform and 
development agenda that emphasizes expanding the private 
sector. If confirmed, I will support Morocco's reform program 
and I will strongly advocate for American exports. I will also 
support the advancement of human rights.
    Mr. Chairman, I have been immersed in policy toward this 
region for 30 years. My formative years were spent in this very 
room on the benches behind you.
    I have built on that experience at the National Security 
Council and in a senior diplomatic position as Assistant 
Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs. These roles 
have given me a reservoir of directly relevant experience to 
draw upon, should I be confirmed.
    I would like to close with a few words about my family. I 
could not have made it this far were it not for the 
unconditional support and love of my wife, Sarosh, who 
steadfastly supported me through the long hours I have logged 
in public service. She did that even as she pursued her own 
career and raised the two fine gentlemen you see behind me.
    This is also an especially meaningful moment for my 
parents. It is the culmination of a journey that began 60 years 
ago when they took a leap of faith and left India for America 
with little more than their dreams.
    They sacrificed and endured a great deal so that my 
brother, sister, and I would have opportunities they never had. 
We are forever grateful to them.
    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.

    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Young--it is an honor to return to the

    Senator Coons. Thank you, Mr. Talwar.
    Next, Dr. Henick?

 STATEMENT OF DR. JONATHAN HENICK OF VIRGINIA, A CAREER MEMBER 
  OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-COUNSELOR, 
NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY ANDPLENIPOTENTIARY OF 
   THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF UZBEKISTAN

    Dr. Henick. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and 
distinguished members of this committee, I, too, am deeply 
grateful for the confidence President Biden and Secretary 
Blinken have entrusted in me with this nomination.
    If confirmed, I will work closely with you to strengthen 
bilateral relations with Uzbekistan.
    I, too, would like to thank my wife and partner, Dominique 
Freire, as well as my son and daughter, Oskar and Carmen.
    As you know, Foreign Service families make enormous 
sacrifices over the course of our careers, and I simply could 
not have served our country without their steadfast support.
    I am also forever in debt to my parents, Bette and Steve, 
for their support and for sparking my interest in international 
affairs and public service.
    I regret that my father, a Marine Corps helicopter pilot 
and Vietnam veteran before spending a career opening foreign 
markets to U.S. commercial products, did not live to see this 
day. I know that he would have been proud.
    This nomination is the culmination of my lifelong interest 
in this region. At university I majored in Soviet area studies 
with a focus on Central Asia. I spent a semester abroad and 
traveled to Uzbekistan before its independence.
    When I joined the Foreign Service, I jumped at the 
opportunity to do my very first overseas assignment at our 
newly established embassy in Tashkent. I have also spent much 
of my career working in and with this region, and I am beyond 
excited at the possibility to go back, if confirmed, in this 
new capacity.
    Located at the heart of Central Asia, Uzbekistan is a 
country rich in history with a young and growing population and 
significant potential for a prosperous future.
    A strong U.S. relationship with Uzbekistan has implications 
that extend beyond our bilateral agenda to the other countries 
of Central Asia, to Afghanistan, Turkey, and the Indo-Pacific 
region.
    At the core of this relationship, now just over 30 years 
old, is the United States' steadfast support for Uzbekistan's 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.
    Uzbekistan has become an increasingly dynamic player in 
Central Asia since adopting a broad-based program of political, 
economic, and social reforms in 2016. We welcome these 
developments and have partnered with Uzbekistan to implement 
reforms that advance respect for human rights, foster 
democratic governance, and promote equitable economic growth.
    As a career diplomat, I have seen firsthand the power of 
building relationships and engaging in public diplomacy, and 
how this can benefit individuals and civil society.
    If confirmed, I will work to continue and improve upon 
already significant initiatives to strengthen Uzbekistan's 
educational system and to facilitate exchange opportunities.
    These impressive efforts are a testament to the 
strengthening bilateral relationship between the United States 
and Uzbekistan.
    I will also work to expand and deepen our cooperation with 
the Government of Uzbekistan to stay the course on reforms. I 
will encourage the development of accountable democratic 
institutions, a flourishing civil society and independent 
media, the strengthening of rule of law, and the protection of 
human rights for all, especially those who are most vulnerable 
and marginalized, including women, religious minorities, and 
LGBTQI+ persons.
    Uzbekistan has also made progress modernizing its economy, 
aiming to rebuild the international connections that place the 
country at the center of historic trade routes. Uzbekistan's 
natural resources, as well as its manufacturing and 
agricultural capacity, are attracting growing interest from 
American companies, including those seeking alternatives to 
Xinjiang-sourced cotton.
    Uzbekistan has also become a regional leader on green 
economic initiatives with its ambitious plans for renewable 
energy and as one of only two Central Asian countries to sign 
the Global Methane Pledge. A prosperous greener Uzbekistan that 
generates jobs for its people and diversifies its international 
trade is very much in the interests of the United States.
    As the Government continues its preparations for accession 
to the World Trade Organization, I will underscore the 
importance of improving the investment climate and 
institutionalizing international labor standards.
    I will also prioritize the expansion of the U.S. security 
partnership. Uzbekistan has long been an important partner in 
supporting Afghanistan stability and, if confirmed, I look 
forward to strengthening bilateral and regional security 
cooperation including on law enforcement matters, border 
security, and counterterrorism.
    Finally, I would endeavor to foster an inclusive work 
environment at our embassy consistent with the Administration's 
and this committee's vision of a State Department workforce 
that values collegiality, teamwork, and respect.
    The diversity of the American people is our greatest 
strength and it is important that U.S. embassies model that 
diversity, especially in places like Uzbekistan where our 
values are not widely understood or, worse, are actively 
misrepresented by malign actors.
    If confirmed, I will seek to advance U.S. interests and 
enhance our strategic partnership with Uzbekistan by 
strengthening our bilateral security, people-to-people ties, 
economic ties, and promoting the democratic values that we 
share.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to appear here today. I 
welcome your questions.

    Senator Coons. Thank you.
    Mr. Viguerie?

 STATEMENT OF LESSLIE VIGUERIE OF VIRGINIA, A CAREER MEMBER OF 
   THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-COUNSELOR, 
NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF 
            THE UNITED STATES TO THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

    Mr. Viguerie. Good morning, Chairman Coons. I am grateful 
to have the opportunity to speak with you today, and thank you 
for considering my nomination to serve as U.S. Ambassador to 
the Kyrgyz Republic.
    I would like to start by thanking my family: my wife, 
Kathryn, who is here with me today, and my three children, 
William, George, and Clara. They have been my support through 
hardship posts, lengthy periods of separation, and frequent 
moves. They have also shared with me the honor of serving our 
country abroad, an honor for which I have always been deeply 
grateful.
    I would also like to thank all the friends and colleagues 
who have supported me over my 30-year career in the Foreign 
Service. Their examples showed me the best aspects of 
leadership, including the importance of building strong teams 
and morale, valuing diversity, and mentoring the next 
generation of U.S. diplomats.
    These values guide me today and, if confirmed, I will have 
no higher priority than the safety and security of the embassy 
community.
    The United States and the Kyrgyz Republic recently marked 
30 years of diplomatic relations. Much has happened in this 
time. The United States has been a strong partner to the Kyrgyz 
Republic from the beginning, providing generous support, 
including more than $10.4 million in COVID-related aid during 
the pandemic.
    U.S. assistance helped Kyrgyz efforts to develop the 
country's democratic institutions, its vibrant civil society, 
and its independent media.
    Since 1993, we have supported the American University of 
Central Asia, where tens of thousands of the region's best and 
brightest have received U.S. accredited degrees.
    If confirmed, I will work to build on the progress of the 
last three decades and ensure that our relationship fulfills 
its potential.
    The United States and the Kyrgyz Republic share many goals 
and a mutual interest in working together to achieve them. The 
Kyrgyz Republic has stated its commitment to fighting 
corruption and organized crime.
    In this effort, it will find no better partner than the 
United States. We hope to strengthen security cooperation to 
address challenges such as disaster preparedness and countering 
transnational threats.
    The United States is committed to supporting Kyrgyz 
economic resilience, connectivity, and diversification beyond 
its traditional partners by developing the country's knowledge 
economy in which a thriving IT sector drives job creation and 
connection to the global economy.
    The Kyrgyz Republic has demonstrated environmental 
leadership in Central Asia as the first in the region to join 
the Global Methane Pledge.
    The United States is also committed to supporting human 
rights and democratic institutions in the Kyrgyz Republic. 
Kyrgyzstan has a unique record in this region. We are proud of 
our long-standing support for the Kyrgyz Republic's energetic 
civil society and its efforts to build accountable democratic 
institutions and strengthen the rule of law.
    It is critical that Kyrgyz leadership safeguards the gains 
made over the last 30 years and upholds media freedom, elevates 
the role of civil society, protects the human rights of all its 
people, including members of all minority groups, and 
strengthens judicial independence.
    If confirmed, I will advocate for Kyrgyz civil society and 
speak out against erosion of democratic governance, corruption, 
and threats to freedom of speech and association, in accordance 
with the values we share with the Kyrgyz people.
    For 30 years the United States has stressed our support for 
the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the 
Kyrgyz Republic.
    If confirmed, I will emphasize the importance of holding 
Russia to account for its aggression in Ukraine, including the 
enforcement of sanctions on Russia.
    I will also advocate for Kyrgyz leadership to promote 
accountability for the PRC's use of forced labor as well as its 
genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and 
members of other ethnic and religious minority groups, 
including ethnic Kyrgyz, in Xinjiang.
    Mr. Chairman, there is ample potential in the U.S.-Kyrgyz 
bilateral relationship. If confirmed, I look forward to 
partnering with this committee and Congress to reinvigorate our 
ties and achieve mutual objectives that benefit not only our 
two countries but the whole of Central Asia.
    Thank you again for considering my nomination and I look 
forward to answering any questions you might have.

  STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL N. ROSENBLUM OF MARYLAND, A CAREER 
    MEMBER OF THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE SERVICE, NOMINATED TO BE 
  AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED 
        STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

    Ambassador Rosenblum. Thank you. Good morning, Chairman 
Coons.
    I am honored to be here today as the President's nominee 
for U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Kazakhstan, and I am 
pleased that my wife, Sharon, and son, Jonah, are with me as 
well.
    The journey that led me here started in the Cleveland 
suburb of Middleburg Heights, Ohio. My mother was a teacher who 
modeled the values of respect, empathy, and tolerance. My 
father worked for 30 years as a NASA scientist while, in his 
spare time, organizing a grassroots movement to advocate for 
the rights of Soviet Jews.
    My parents' example inspired me to pursue a career in 
public service and international affairs. I studied Russian 
history, language, and literature as an undergraduate and later 
pursued a master's degree in Soviet studies.
    In between, I worked for and was inspired by an outstanding 
public servant, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan. He took this 
chamber's oversight role seriously and in that spirit, if 
confirmed, I look forward to collaborating closely with the 
U.S. Congress and particularly with the members of this 
committee to promote U.S. interests and values in our 
relationship with the Republic of Kazakhstan.
    In my four years as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for 
Central Asia and currently as Ambassador to Uzbekistan, I have 
often been asked why the United States cares about this region. 
What U.S. national interests are served by devoting time, 
attention, and resources to these faraway countries?
    My answer is straightforward. We care because what happens 
there directly affects the security of the United States and 
its citizens.
    We want these countries to develop as stable, prosperous, 
and friendly U.S. partners because we know that if they do not 
we will pay the price here at home.
    At the same time, it is not in our long-term security or 
economic interest for a single power to dominate this region. 
We are much better off having mutually beneficial relations 
with a diverse group of sovereign countries, both big and 
small, in Eurasia and Central Asia.
    The Government and people of Kazakhstan have appreciated 
America's steadfast support for their independent sovereignty 
and territorial integrity since 1991.
    My goal, if confirmed, will be to partner with the 
Government and people of Kazakhstan to ensure that they remain 
free to determine their own policies and chart their own 
future.
    After centuries under the rule of external powers and 30-
plus years now as citizens of an independent nation, the people 
of Kazakhstan understand full well why the principles of 
sovereignty and territorial integrity are critical to the 
maintenance of a stable international order.
    If confirmed, I will emphasize the importance of holding 
Russia accountable for its aggression against Ukraine. I will 
also advocate that Kazakhstan promote accountability for the 
PRC's atrocities against Uighurs and members of other religious 
and ethnic minority groups, including a million and a half 
ethnic Kazakhs living in Xinjiang.
    Mr. Chairman, the U.S.-Kazakhstan bilateral relationship is 
already strong. If confirmed, I hope to deepen and broaden it 
even further in ways that not only benefit our two countries 
but the whole of Central Asia.
    Kazakhstan has long been a leader in efforts to better 
integrate the five Central Asian nations. If confirmed, I will 
continue to seek new ways to promote such regional cooperation 
including through the C5+1 diplomatic platform.
    My number-one priority, if confirmed, will be to ensure the 
safety and health of my embassy and consulate teams as well as 
any and all American citizens in Kazakhstan.
    I also intend to make it a priority to, first, deepen our 
security and law enforcement partnership to pursue our shared 
goals in the region including countering terrorism and other 
transnational threats; second, to encourage Kazakhstan to 
implement the sweeping reforms it initiated in the wake of 
serious civil unrest in January.
    It is critical that Kazakhstan's leadership live up to its 
pledges to uphold media freedom, elevate the role of civil 
society, strengthen judicial independence, and protect the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of all its people.
    And, third, to increase people-to-people interactions and 
expand our economic, educational, scientific, and cultural 
ties. Nothing will help solidify the foundations of a U.S.-
Kazakhstani partnership more than creating strong connections 
between the people of our two nations.
    Mr. Chairman, if confirmed, I pledge to work closely with 
you to support America's growing strategic partnership with 
Kazakhstan.

             Prepared Statement of Hon. Daniel N. Rosenblum

    Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and members of this committee, I 
am honored to be here today as the President's nominee for U.S 
Ambassador to the Republic of Kazakhstan.
    The journey that led me here started in the Cleveland suburb of 
Middleburg Heights, Ohio. My mother was a teacher who modeled the 
values of respect, empathy, and tolerance. My father worked for 30 
years as a NASA scientist, while, in his spare time, advocating for the 
rights of Soviet Jews. My parents' example inspired me to pursue a 
career in public service and international affairs, and taught me to 
embrace diversity, equity, inclusiveness, and access, because society 
is richer, and organizations are more effective when everyone 
participates.
    I studied Russian history, language, and literature as an 
undergraduate, and later pursued a master's degree in Soviet Studies. 
In between, I worked for and was inspired by an outstanding public 
servant: Senator Carl Levin of Michigan. He took this chamber's 
oversight role seriously, and in that spirit, if confirmed, I look 
forward to collaborating closely with the U.S. Congress--and 
particularly with the members of this committee--to promote U.S. 
interests and values in our relationship with the Republic of 
Kazakhstan.
    In my four years as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Central 
Asia, and currently as U.S. Ambassador to Uzbekistan, I have often been 
asked why the United States cares about this region. What U.S. national 
interests are served by devoting time, attention, and resources to 
these faraway countries? My answer is straightforward: we care because 
what happens there directly affects the safety and security of the 
United States and its citizens. We want these countries to develop as 
stable, prosperous, and friendly U.S. partners because we know that, if 
they don't, we will pay the price here at home.
    At the same time, it is not in our long-term security or economic 
interests for a single power to dominate this region. We are much 
better off having mutually beneficial relations with a diverse group of 
sovereign countries, both big and small, in Europe, Eurasia and Central 
Asia. The Government and people of Kazakhstan appreciate America's 
steadfast support for their sovereignty since 1991, when we were the 
first to recognize their independence. My goal, if confirmed, will be 
to partner with the Government and people of Kazakhstan to ensure that 
they remain free to determine their own policies and chart their own 
future.
    After centuries under the rule of external powers, and thirty plus 
years as citizens of an independent nation, the people of Kazakhstan 
have a deep appreciation for the principles of sovereignty and 
territorial integrity; they fully understand why these principles are 
critical to the maintenance of a stable international order. If 
confirmed, I will emphasize these shared values, and the importance of 
holding Russia accountable for its aggression against Ukraine. I will 
also advocate that Kazakhstan promote accountability for the PRC's 
atrocities against Uyghurs and members of other religious and ethnic 
minority groups--including ethnic Kazakhs--in Xinjiang.
    The U.S.-Kazakhstan bilateral relationship is already strong. If 
confirmed, I hope to deepen and broaden it even further, in ways that 
not only benefit our two countries, but the whole of Central Asia. 
Kazakhstan has long been a leader in efforts to better integrate the 
five Central Asian nations. I will continue looking for new ways to 
promote such regional cooperation, including through the C5+1 
diplomatic platform.
    My number one priority, if confirmed, will be to ensure the safety 
and security of my Embassy and Consulate teams, as well as all American 
citizens in Kazakhstan. Beyond that, I intend to make it a priority to:


   Deepen our security and law enforcement partnership with Kazakhstan 
        to pursue our shared goals in the region, including countering 
        terrorism and other transnational threats.

   Encourage Kazakhstan to implement the sweeping reforms it initiated 
        in the wake of serious civil unrest last January, and provide 
        technical assistance and training as needed and requested. It 
        is critical that Kazakhstan's leadership live up to its pledges 
        to uphold media freedom, elevate the role of civil society, 
        strengthen judicial independence, and protect the fundamental 
        rights and freedoms of all its people. We stand ready to 
        continue assisting the Government and people of Kazakhstan to 
        make these pledges a reality.

   Broaden engagement between the citizens of Kazakhstan and the 
        United States by increasing people-to-people interactions and 
        expanding our economic and business, educational, scientific, 
        and cultural ties. Nothing will help solidify the foundation 
        for long-term U.S.-Kazakhstani partnership more than creating 
        and maintaining strong connections between the people of our 
        two nations.


    Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, if I am confirmed, I pledge 
to work closely with you to support America's growing strategic 
partnership with Kazakhstan. I look forward to your questions.


    Senator Coons. Thank you very much, Ambassador Rosenblum.
    Mr. Hood?

STATEMENT OF JOEY R. HOOD OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, A CAREER MEMBER OF 
   THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-COUNSELOR, 
NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF 
    THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA

    Mr. Hood. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to 
appear before you today. I want to thank Senator Shaheen for 
that wonderful introduction.
    I am honored by President Biden's and Secretary Blinken's 
trust in me and by the support of my wife, Anne, and children, 
Fiona and Henry.
    If confirmed, my most important priority as ambassador 
would be the safety and security of Americans living in and 
visiting Tunisia. My next priority would be to help put Tunisia 
on a more stable and prosperous trajectory.
    A long-standing U.S. partner and major non-NATO ally, 
Tunisia now finds itself suffering the global repercussions of 
Putin's brutal aggression in Ukraine, grappling with rising 
food prices and spiking energy prices.
    Putin's war of choice has exacerbated Tunisia's economic 
crisis, and quick action is needed to reverse this trajectory.
    If confirmed, I would promote a vision of inclusive and 
open economic growth. The Government is negotiating an 
agreement with the IMF and this could be a step toward reforms 
that would benefit all Tunisians.
    Tunisia could also improve its investment in climate by 
focusing on infrastructure and secure technology. If confirmed, 
I would advocate for U.S. companies to help provide these.
    As Tunisians grapple with these economic challenges they 
have experienced an alarming erosion of democratic norms and 
fundamental freedoms over the past year, reversing many hard-
fought gains since they overthrew a dictator in 2011.
    President Kais Saied's actions over the past year to 
suspend democratic governance and consolidate executive power 
have raised serious questions. The United States, both on our 
own and in coordination with our Group of Seven partners, has 
advocated for a swift return to democratic governance.
    We have urged an inclusive democratic reform process, 
emphasized continued protection of fundamental freedoms, and 
insisted on respect for judicial independence and rule of law.
    I would continue this engagement, if confirmed, and 
encourage Tunisia's leaders to rapidly reestablish a democratic 
government accountable to their people.
    Tunisians have made clear that their demands for greater 
economic prosperity must not come at the expense of their hard-
won democracy or human rights.
    I agree with that and ascribe to the Administration's view 
that the U.S.-Tunisia bilateral relationship is strongest when 
there is a shared commitment to democratic values, human 
rights, and fundamental freedoms.
    We continue to review our assistance programs to assure 
that they align with our values and interests. If confirmed, I 
would use all tools of U.S. influence to advocate for a return 
to democratic governance and mitigate Tunisians suffering from 
Putin's devastating war, economic mismanagement, and political 
upheaval.
    Tunisian leaders' recognition that a vibrant civil society 
is a partner, not an adversary, has been a key reason for its 
democratic success. Civil society has demonstrated dynamism and 
resiliency in representing the aims and demands of the Tunisian 
people.
    If confirmed, I would continue to support civil society and 
engage regularly with the Government to protect fundamental 
freedoms.
    I would also urge that political reforms and parliamentary 
elections announced for later this year are transparent and 
inclusive.
    Amid this political upheaval, I understand that the 
Tunisian military has remained an apolitical and professional 
force that reports to civilian leaders.
    If confirmed, I would work to ensure this remains the case 
and look for new avenues of collaboration on U.S. security 
priorities, particularly against global terrorist threats, 
while further strengthening human rights protections.
    The normalization of relations with Israel, including 
through the historic Abraham Accords, has led to greater peace 
and security in the region and deepened opportunities for 
expanded economic growth and productivity.
    If confirmed, I would support further efforts to normalize 
diplomatic and economic relations with the State of Israel in 
the region.
    Thank you, Mr. Ranking Member, members of this committee, 
for this opportunity.
    If confirmed, I look forward to leading the team of 
professionals at our embassy and working with you to advance 
U.S. interests and strengthen our shared values in Tunisia.
    I look forward to your questions.

    Senator Young [presiding]. I thank all of our nominees for 
their statements.
    Mr. Rosenblum, Kazakhstan has been a steadfast partner with 
the United States on a number of issues, from our use of its 
space port for our astronauts to access the International Space 
Station to its commitment to protect our personnel and 
consulate during political unrest in Almaty.
    However, Kazakhstan has thus far taken a neutral stance on 
Ukraine, declining to support either side in this war of 
Russian aggression.
    Kazakhstan's commitment of humanitarian aid to Ukraine as 
well as its additional defense spending indicate anxiety about 
Russian geopolitical ambitions. This is despite continuing 
military partnership per media reporting on Kazakhstan's 
participation in upcoming Russian military exercises.
    Sir, what steps would you take to encourage Kazakhstan to 
take more decisive steps to counter Russian aggression?
    Ambassador Rosenblum. Senator Young, thank you for that 
question.
    It will definitely be at the center of my attention, as it 
is for all of us now, the effects of the war in Ukraine and the 
region.
    First of all, I want to say that our support, as I 
mentioned in my statement, for Kazakhstan's sovereignty, 
territorial integrity, and independence has been consistent and 
remains strong, and that will be an organizing principle of 
everything I do in Kazakhstan, if confirmed.
    Secondly, we do recognize the reality of Kazakhstan's 
geographical and historical and economic position in the 
region. They share a 4,700-mile border with Russia. Russia is 
their main trading partner, main source of investment, and that 
is a reality that they have to deal with.
    As you pointed out, Kazakhstan has remained neutral in the 
conflict with respect to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and, at 
the same time, have stated publicly and clearly that they will 
not recognize the independence of the so-called Luhansk and 
Donetsk Republics.
    They have also stated publicly that they will do everything 
in their power to not undermine the sanctions regime against 
Russia and have worked very closely with us to make sure that 
they do not cross that line.
    And they have also said that they will not support the 
deployment of any Kazakhstani troops through the Collective 
Security Treaty Organization with Russian-led alliance that 
they belong to--military group.
    So all of those things we take as positive steps and, if 
confirmed, when I go I will reinforce that, the importance of 
them remaining, at a minimum, neutral and also reinforce what 
the Kazakhstani leadership itself has said, which is they 
recognize they are too dependent on Russia, especially for 
their trade and their oil exports, and need to diversify, and 
anything we can do to help them diversify we will.
    Senator Young. Sir, I think you have done a very good job 
of contextualizing the diplomatic and economic and other 
challenges the country faces on account of its geography and 
history and other factors. I do think that it is a positive. 
You laid out many positives and, perhaps, that is something we 
can build on as well as it relates to the situation in Ukraine.
    How would you ensure further, sir, that Kazakhstan does not 
fall into China's sphere of influence as it seeks closer ties 
with other nations?
    Ambassador Rosenblum. So, again, there are realities that 
Kazakhstan faces with respect to China, and China is a very 
important source of investment in their oil and gas sector, one 
of their major trading partners.
    At the same time, Kazakhstan practices and they publicly 
declare what they call multivector diplomacy, and multivector 
to them means that they have to maintain important 
relationships and mutually beneficial relations with lots of 
partners, not just Russia, not just China. The United States, 
Europe--they want all of that to be part of the picture.
    So, if confirmed, my goal would be to help them in that--in 
their own goal, to reach their own goal of strengthening these 
other vectors. We can do that in a number of ways, including by 
promoting a better investment climate in Kazakhstan so that 
more U.S. investment in business can enter and they can 
diversify their trading relationships.
    We can also, with respect to oil, in particular--oil and 
gas--have them diversify from their heavy dependence on that 
sector of their economy because it is the oil and gas that 
especially ties them closely both to Russia and China, both for 
export routes and, in the case of China, as a customer.
    There is a number of ways that we can work on that. I am 
committed, if confirmed, to doing so, and the important thing, 
I think, here is that it is the Kazakhstanis' own goal. That 
is, we are helping them to achieve their own goal of not being 
overly dependent on their neighbors.
    Senator Young. Thank you much, Mr. Rosenblum.
    From one Stan to another, Mr. Henick, you have been 
nominated to be our ambassador to Uzbekistan. As it relates to 
the Ukraine crisis, State Department has repeatedly engaged the 
Central Asian governments this year to reaffirm U.S. support 
for Uzbek independence and territorial integrity as well as the 
C5+1 strategic partnership.
    Secretary Blinken reiterated the Administration's position 
during Foreign Minister Kamilov's visit to Washington in March 
while also condemning Russia's unprovoked actions in Ukraine.
    I note that Tashkent registered businesses have recently 
been hit by sanctions for engagement with Russian entities on 
the Treasury Department's sanctions list.
    If confirmed, how would you encourage our Uzbek partners to 
avoid such dealings as well as take a stronger stance against 
Russian aggression?
    Dr. Henick. Thank you, Senator, for that question.
    Uzbekistan finds itself, I think, in a very similar 
situation to Kazakhstan. They do not have the luxury of simply 
being able to cut off their relationship with Russia, which 
remains their largest trading partner, major investor; 
obviously, there are historical cultural ties.
    At the same time, Uzbekistan has proven to be a strong 
partner of the United States and has been sensitive to the 
concerns that we have expressed, certainly, about Russian 
aggression and I think, Senator, you--as you mentioned in your 
opening statement, there is a reassessment going on in the 
region about their relationship with Russia in light of 
Russia's aggression against Ukraine.
    And so we have found that we are having a productive 
dialogue with the Government of Uzbekistan. I think the key, 
going forward, will be to be as cooperative and transparent as 
possible about the nature and the specifics of the sanctions 
that we are levying, to hear from the Uzbeks about which of 
these sanctions, if any, are very difficult or impossible for 
them to comply with and to, when necessary, as you have pointed 
out, Senator, to designate companies that are in violation of 
those sanctions to send a clear message to other private sector 
entities in Uzbekistan about the dangers of doing business with 
Russia.
    Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Young. Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Viguerie, COVID-19 and economic sanctions have battered 
the Russian economy, presenting an opportunity to encourage 
Central Asian countries to rethink their relationships with 
Moscow.
    As their governments warm to the idea of greater regional 
integration and partnerships with the U.S., the door may also 
be open to exploitation by other actors, particularly China.
    How would you characterize the Kyrgyz reaction to U.S. 
engagement on this issue, particularly as we also call on the 
host nation to respect human rights and freedom of expression?
    Mr. Viguerie. Thank you for the question, Senator.
    Kyrgyzstan is in an unusual position. Many of the factors 
that my two colleagues outlined also hold true for Kyrgyzstan. 
But in addition, Kyrgyzstan relies for about a third of its 
economy on remittances from Russia. So that has a colossal 
economic impact on Kyrgyzstan.
    The jury is still out on how much of an influence the 
Russian economic situation is going to have on those 
remittances.
    I take your point on China. China owns about a third or 
more of Kyrgyzstan's debt so it, too, exercises a huge amount 
of economic influence on the country.
    The United States has been very active in engaging 
Kyrgyzstan to participate in regional organizations. Some, 
through our assistance, organize electrical transmission 
through Karim and CASA-1000. Others support general 
connectivity. There is an interest in Kyrgyzstan in pursuing 
these opportunities but there is a concern in Kyrgyzstan about 
their two big neighbors as well.
    Thank you.
    Senator Young. Thank you.
    Thank you to all the nominees who have spoken to these 
issues. I have learned quite a bit about that region just in 
your presentations today. So thank you.
    I will look forward, should you be confirmed, to working 
with all of you on some of these challenges.
    Mr. Talwar, as you know, I was one of the lead co-sponsors 
of the Israel Normalization Act to strengthen and expand 
normalization between Israel and a number of countries in the 
region, including Morocco.
    I was encouraged to see other countries also begin taking 
baby steps toward fully integrating Israel into the regional 
framework such as Riyadh's recent approval of Israeli use of 
Saudi airspace for commercial overflights.
    Do you consider the Abraham Accords to be a success that we 
should endeavor to build upon and do you believe it is in the 
United States interest to see other countries pursue 
normalization with Israel?
    Mr. Talwar. Senator, thanks very much for the question.
    I believe that the answer is yes. I believe that the 
Abraham Accords have put us on the cusp of a potentially 
historic transformation in the region.
    And as it relates to Morocco and Israel, that relationship 
is going full bore and you have seen, literally, dozens of 
memorandums of understanding signed between the two countries 
in sectors ranging from agriculture to energy to supply chains.
    Just yesterday there were two ministers in Rabat from 
Israel who signed an agreement on judicial and legal 
cooperation and, if confirmed, this is going to be one of my 
highest priorities.
    I think working in two dimensions, first, to help buttress 
and support in any way we can and consistent with the law that 
you mentioned--the Israel Normalization Act--Israel Relations 
Normalization Act--to see what we can do to support the further 
building out and cementing of that relationship, and then 
second, there is the regional dimension that you referenced to 
connect this to the Negev Forum so that we can expand the 
circle of peace and so that people throughout the regions begin 
to see and feel the tangible benefits of peace with Israel.
    Senator Young. Thank you.
    So just--so you will be encouraging, should you be 
confirmed, the Moroccan Government to, in turn, encourage other 
African and Middle Eastern nations to normalize relations with 
Israel. Is that accurate?
    Mr. Talwar. Senator, yes, that is accurate, and Morocco has 
a great deal of influence. It really considers itself as a 
North African country and that will be one of the things I will 
work on, if confirmed.
    Senator Young. Yes, sir.
    Given the reality we have seen in the last two years of the 
implementation and expansion of the Accords, maybe you could 
speak with a little more specificity as--about the role they 
might have in the political and economic development of the 
region.
    Mr. Talwar. Sure, Senator.
    I think the next phase here, really, is to translate the 
agreements that have been made into actual benefits that people 
can feel so that these are not just abstract agreements sitting 
out there which are negotiated in fancy rooms but actually 
translate into benefits economic, first and foremost, things 
that transform society and make them--improve them.
    People-to-people ties, which Morocco is really a leader on, 
you now have tourism booming between the two countries. Of 
course, there is an historic and long-standing Jewish 
community, which is very much recognized as part of the fabric 
of Morocco, which stands as one of the pillars in that 
relationship and there are maybe half a million Israelis of 
Moroccan descent, perhaps more. So that is one dimension of it.
    But to the extent that you can show benefits on the 
economic front, commercially, in terms of other standards of 
living that start to rise in the region because of this, I 
think you will have a bandwagoning effect that will just 
bolster moderates across the region.
    Senator Young. Thank you, sir.
    Before I move on to Mr. Hood for a short question, I just 
wanted to speak to the effort to counter China through your 
role, Mr. Talwar. I commend the work of the embassy and 
consulate in partnering with Morocco to advance our security 
and economic priorities.
    With the 15th anniversary of our free trade agreement, 
Morocco continues to be a strong partner in the region. 
Confronting economic aggression from countries such as China 
requires robust partnerships and a sound strategy.
    How should the United States continue to engage Morocco to 
counter China in North Africa, sir?
    Mr. Talwar. Thanks very much for the question, Senator.
    If confirmed, this will be a high priority for me. China is 
beginning to make inroads in that region, including in Morocco, 
and I think we have to keep a very close eye on that.
    Morocco does not have a comprehensive strategic partnership 
with Morocco, which is their highest level of relationship that 
they will bestow upon some of the countries.
    Nonetheless, China has been active, particularly in the 
cultural space. They have three Confucius Institutes. They have 
been training people through Huawei academies.
    We actually do more than they do in terms of Cisco being 
involved. They are training a lot of Moroccans. And they have 
also--we have also been doing a lot of work through the--
recently through the Development Finance Corporation and that 
is one of the most effective tools that we have to counter the 
Chinese approach, which, of course, is very state centric, very 
nontransparent and they are beginning to move into areas, for 
example, joint ventures they have proposed in R&D, vocational 
training, things of that sort.
    And I think that we have to be active early on and using 
the tools that Congress has provided to be able to work 
effectively against them.
    Senator Young. Thank you. I am glad you mentioned the 
Development Finance Corporation. I, of course, am in the 
presence of one of the founding fathers of that effort. That 
would be Senator Coons, for the C-SPAN2 cameras.
    And I am also glad you mentioned our private sector 
partners. So thank you so much.
    Mr. Hood, just a final question for you, sir. Seeing many 
parties' boycott of the referendum on President Saied's 
constitutional amendment, it appears Tunisia's democratic 
institutions are at risk.
    If confirmed, how would you urge President Saied's 
administration to be responsive, transparent, and accountable 
to the Tunisian people?
    Mr. Hood. Thank you for the question, Senator.
    First, I would like to thank Chairman Menendez, Ranking 
Member Risch, Chairman Meeks, and Ranking Member McCaul for the 
statement that they made yesterday, which was very helpful. I 
will read just part of it here.
    ``The United States will continue to support the Tunisian 
people and encourage efforts to return to a transparent and 
inclusive system of democratic governance. We urge President 
Saied to work constructively with all Tunisians and the state 
of emergency and take steps to restore Tunisia's separation of 
powers, democratic institutions, and the rule of law. ``
    If confirmed, I would continue these efforts, not just 
through private meetings but also through our public support to 
civil society voices. One of the things that is unique about 
Tunisia and the region is that it has a very vibrant civil 
society and I think that is thanks due, in large part, to 
support from the United States and from other partners, and we 
would continue this because the voice of the people, 
ultimately, in a democracy and especially in Tunisia are the 
biggest levers on executive power.
    And so, if confirmed, that is what I would focus on.
    Senator Young. Thank you, sir. Thank you all for--once 
again, for your commitment to serving our great country. I 
thank your families, some of whom--some family members are 
present, and I will look forward to doing some good together.
    I am off to cast an important vote for a China competition 
bill.
    Mr. Chairman?
    Senator Coons [presiding]. And I appreciate the ranking 
member's recognition of my hard work with then Chairman Corker 
on the DFC.
    I just want to congratulate you, Senator Young, on very 
hard work on a critical piece of legislation that is about to 
be voted into law.
    That is the single best thing we can do to strengthen 
American competitiveness and innovation, to prepare us to 
succeed in our global competition with China, and to make a 
stronger and more creative nation likely for the next 
generation.
    So congratulations on what is a landmark piece of 
legislation. Thank you.
    Senator Young. Thank you, sir.
    Senator Coons. I now look forward to one round of 
questions, at the conclusion of which we will likely close this 
hearing. So if there are staff of any members who are intending 
to come and question, make sure that I know now because by the 
agreement with the ranking member I am going to ask about five 
minutes of questions and we will wrap this up unless I hear 
otherwise from the staff of some committee member.
    First, I have a series of questions which the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee asks of, literally, every nominee 
and I note, Ambassador Rosenblum, you made reference to having 
served under Senator Levin.
    Yes, he would be pleased to know that we continue to 
exercise a forceful oversight.
    So a simple yes or no from each of the five nominees would 
suffice.
    Do you agree to appear before this committee and make 
officials from your office available to the committee and 
designated staff when invited?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    Senator Coons. Do you commit to keep this committee fully 
and currently informed about the activities under your purview?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    Senator Coons. Do you commit to engaging in meaningful 
consultation while policies are being developed, not just 
providing notification after the fact?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    Senator Coons. And, last, do you commit to promptly 
responding to requests for briefings and information as 
requested by this committee and its designated staff?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    Senator Coons. Wonderful. Thank you, all.
    Mr. Talwar, I will start with you.
    I had the opportunity to speak with the President on my way 
back from the floor vote--he wishes you all the best--and we 
reminisced about how I first met you when you were in service 
to the then senator on, literally, this committee many years 
ago.
    I appreciate your raising the DFC. I am a great believer in 
its capabilities, in particular, as an alternative pathway to 
development financing that allows for higher standards--labor 
standards, environmental standards, and transparency.
    How do you imagine the DFC being helpful in your future 
role, if confirmed, as U.S. Ambassador to Morocco?
    Mr. Talwar. Thanks so much for the question, Senator, and, 
again, I do want to commend you and Senator Corker for having 
authored the bill that--and the act that created the DFC.
    I think it is a powerful tool in terms of being able to 
promote development in a way that is consistent with our 
values, and the DFC actually is becoming more active in 
Morocco.
    There are about three projects which have been financed 
valued at over $100 million in areas like climate resiliency 
and sustainable business environment, and there are about 10 
more projects--actually more than 10--which are in the pipeline 
now and those will be in areas such as health care and some 
others as well.
    And I think this is just an incredibly powerful tool and it 
is coming exactly at the right time in terms of this upping of 
our game because, as in my exchange with Senator Young, I 
mentioned how China is really beginning to do the same thing.
    And, of course, if you put the side by side, I think our 
approach and the DFC approach--free markets, transparency, 
environmental consideration, workers' rights--stands in sharp 
contrast to the Chinese approach of nontransparency, state 
centric, et cetera.
    So I think this will be a very powerful tool and, if 
confirmed, I will absolutely be working closely with the DFC 
and I look forward to consulting with you on this as well.
    Senator Coons. Thank you. I look forward to that.
    I have visited Morocco several times, initially principally 
to advocate for the Clementine exports from Morocco to the Port 
of Wilmington, Delaware, but then later for a more expanded 
conversation about our security and values partnership, and I 
may return to ask about the Abraham Accords. But I need to for 
now keep moving, if I might.
    Mr. Henick, talk to me about how you will work to promote 
liberalizing political and economic reforms, and whether you 
see room for an expanded partnership between the United States 
and Uzbekistan in foreign assistance.
    Dr. Henick. Yes, Senator, absolutely I do see room for us 
to continue to deepen that partnership.
    Uzbekistan is really at a critical juncture right now. The 
reform program that President Mirziyoyev instituted began six 
years ago and some of the reforms have been incredibly 
successful.
    But I think they are now getting to the point where it is 
going to be more and more difficult to stay the course as you 
start to approach things like really strengthening civil 
society, strengthening independent media, implementing rule of 
law.
    We have had under Ambassador Rosenblum's leadership a lot 
of success in partnering with the Government of Uzbekistan 
using our assistance programs, particularly in the area of rule 
of law, to start to strengthen these reforms and we are 
starting to see real results.
    If confirmed, Senator, I would certainly continue to use 
those tools as well as, if I may offer, I think the Development 
Finance Corporation also can play a critical role in Central 
Asia where it does not have a large profile right now but three 
of your nominees on this panel havebeen working over the last 
several years to try to work with the DFC to make it clear to 
other outside investors in the region that we, too, are 
prepared to offer our own investments and investments that 
bring the kind of quality and represent our values and can be a 
real alternative to other countries in the region.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Mr. Viguerie. I do think--excuse 
me, thank you, Dr. Henick.
    I do think one of our key challenges--you are going to tell 
me how much time I have--one of our core challenges is giving 
the DFC the resources that it needs and deserves to be able to 
grow to scale--I am trying to clear an annoying budgetary 
scoring rule that prevents them from fully utilizing equity--
and to syndicate to partner with other nations that are also 
open societies and want to promote more transparent, more 
sustainable alternatives to Chinese financing.
    I would be interested, if I could, Mr. Viguerie, about how 
you would see our working to provide alternatives to Chinese 
financing in Kyrgyzstan but also how do we support a resurgence 
of democratic governance?
    Mr. Viguerie. Thank you for the question, sir.
    On the question of economic alternatives, I understand the 
U.S. Embassy has already been focused through assistance on the 
interesting development of a potential IT sector in Kyrgyzstan, 
which I think reflects--the growth of this reflects the fact it 
is a more open society than some of its neighbors.
    The embassy also has an English language program for 
professionals, which will also go far to promote this new 
sector.
    On the DFC itself, I understand that the embassy has been 
in contact with Kyrgyz officials. There, the challenge is to 
find internationally bankable projects that the DFC will be 
interested in and that the Kyrgyz make available. Obviously, it 
will become a large focus for me, if confirmed.
    On democracy itself, it has definitely been a unique aspect 
of Kyrgyzstan. We support it through assistance through small 
grants. I think, as an ambassador, one of my most important--if 
confirmed, my most important duties is to promote the expansion 
of rule of law and anti-corruption in Kyrgyzstan.
    Senator Coons. Thank you.
    If I might, Ambassador Rosenblum, just continue on that 
line.
    How do we use the tools, both support for civil society, 
advocating for democracy--how do we succeed in holding the 
Chinese accountable for the gross human rights violations 
happening in Xinjiang and how would you advance our 
relationship with Kazakhstan?
    I was struck at their hesitancy--their refusal to publicly 
embrace and endorse Russia's aggression in Ukraine, Russia's 
annexation attempts, recognition of the so-called independent 
republics in the Donbas.
    How would you work to advance these core goals?
    Ambassador Rosenblum. Senator, thank you for the question.
    It is an ongoing challenge for Kazakhstan to be where it 
is, to share these big borders with China and Russia and also 
to be so dependent on them for its trade, its oil exports.
    I think 80 percent of Kazakhstan's oil exports transit 
Russian territory and the Russians have shown recently, just in 
recent months, the ability to sort of turn that tap off when 
they want to, and it sent a very strong message recognized by 
President Tokayev of Kazakhstan, who has publicly said, we have 
to do something to diversify our oil exports and not to rely 
just on this pipeline.
    And there are ways that we can support them in these 
efforts to diversify, to build its relations outside of its 
Russia and China neighbors. DFC was already mentioned. I think 
that could also play a role in Kazakhstan as well. Promoting 
more U.S. investment coming in, encouraging U.S. companies to 
locate there.
    Sometimes it is difficult for U.S. companies to compete on 
price or on the financing terms they can offer. I found this in 
my service in Uzbekistan repeatedly.
    We have to make a case helping--working with the companies 
that U.S. companies bring a value that others do not. It is a 
long-term value and it pays off in the long term both in the 
products they make and the investments they make in people. We 
have seen this repeatedly in Uzbekistan and I expect the same 
would be true in Kazakhstan, if I am confirmed.
    You also mentioned the situation with the human rights 
abuses, the atrocities in Xinjiang and Kazakhstan's position on 
that. I think it is important to emphasize that, again, 
Kazakhstan faces the reality of having this big, powerful 
neighbor that it depends on for so much.
    At the same time, there are a million and a half Kazakhs 
living in Xinjiang, many of whom have also been victims of the 
repression there and, as a result, Kazakhstan, in my view, has 
done what it can to protect people, for example, who escape, 
who cross the border, and they have consistently followed a 
nonrefoulement policy. They have not sent people back.
    If I am confirmed, I will continue to press for that policy 
to continue as well as to allow victims of Chinese repression 
in Kazakhstan to organize and speak out freely, to highlight 
the human rights abuses there.
    It is not always an easy issue to deal with in the context 
of Kazakhstan and, yet, I think we have a strong enough 
partnership that we can continue to promote accountability for 
the horrific human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
    Senator Coons. If I might, for all three of you, I am 
grateful for the skill and the study and the experience and the 
diligence you will bring to these three absolutely critical 
Central Asian republics.
    It is a part of the world that does not get the attention 
that it deserves here in the Congress but that is critical to 
the future. They were at the crossroads of commerce for 
centuries. They are at the center of renewed focus and 
attention by China and Russia, and our ability to show what 
free and open societies can do and what democracy can bring--
forgive me, I am getting a call from the floor.
    I just--I look forward to hearing from you and supporting 
you in your service in these nations.
    Last, if I might, Mr. Hood, I remember well a visit to 
Tunisia around the time that the Quartet received the Nobel 
Prize. It was exciting. There was a vibrancy to the democracy 
and civil society there.
    We met with a very wide range of leaders from parliament, 
from the judiciary, from the executive, and the striking 
backsliding, the transformation back to an authoritarian state 
in recent days is truly alarming.
    I would be interested in how you think we can best 
strengthen civil society, how we can push back on Putin's 
misinformation. There is an active and successful 
disinformation campaign that is leading many on the continent 
to believe that it is American sanctions and actions, not 
Russia's aggression, that are causing skyrocketing food and 
fertilizer and fuel prices.
    So how do we counter Russian disinformation, strengthen 
civil society, and maintain true to our values while also 
maintaining this critical strategic relationship?
    Mr. Hood. Thank you for the question, Senator.
    I think, in a word, I would say engagement. I hope that we 
can welcome you back to Tunisia along with your colleagues 
because I think it is critical and powerful when 
representatives of our legislative branch visit us at our 
embassies overseas and engage with our foreign interlocutors.
    I think that is all the more important in a place like 
Tunisia where they have been going through political turbulence 
and where Tunisians are calling out for change. They are 
hungry. They are tired. They are unemployed.
    They want their country to have economic prosperity while 
also having the Government protect their fundamental rights, 
and that is exactly what I am going to try to help them to do, 
if I am confirmed, through our engagement, through our 
assistance programs, that we are shifting to focus more on 
amplifying the voices of civil society and institutions and 
organizations that can hold accountable executive power no 
matter what the results of the referendum or the legislative 
elections that are projected for December.
    With regard to the misinformation, I think we still have a 
very powerful voice in the United States of America and so I 
will use it. I will ask for help from the legislative branch 
and from other parts of Washington as well but as well our 
Group of Seven partners that the Administration has been 
working with diligently for the past year to make clear what 
the world's democracies expect and hope to see in Tunisia, not 
just for the people but also for the Government.
    Senator Coons. Thank you. Let me make a closing comment, if 
I might.
    Every time I have the opportunity to visit one of our 
embassies overseas I try to visit with mid-level career Foreign 
Service Officers, civil servants, foreign nationals who work as 
part of our embassy teams, and ask for ideas and suggestions 
for ways that we could make the life of Foreign Service 
families, in particular, but the lives of all who serve with us 
as development and diplomacy professionals easier.
    I do now chair the Subcommittee of Appropriations that 
funds the State Department and USAID. This committee will be 
considering an authorizing bill on August 3rd, and there are 
small but important things.
    One of the things currently being debated is providing 
access to the internet as a utility in a way that in countries 
where it is incredibly expensive, to make it available without 
draining the household resources, ways that we can have dual 
career families where they work for different agencies or work 
in the public sector and private sector more successfully 
transition from post to post.
    We talked in a hearing yesterday about the importance of 
having paid internships to promote diversity within the ranks 
of the Foreign Service.
    All of this interests me intensely and I appreciate that 
several of you raised that, as an ambassador, the safety and 
the security and the vibrancy of the many people who serve our 
nation in the posts for which you will, if confirmed, be 
responsible encourage me because paying attention to the needs 
of those who dedicate their lives to representing us overseas 
is an important part, in my view, of your service and of mine.
    Let me close by thanking Sarosh and Dominique, Kathryn, 
Sharon, and Anne for being here and for supporting your spouses 
and your families, and if I got this right and I probably did 
not, Haris and Ilyas, Oskar, Carmen and, I think, Fiona and 
Henry, William, George, and Clara.
    Many of you cited your parents as inspiration for your 
taking this step forward--Puneet, talking about your parents 
taking the risk of coming to the United States--parents who 
served in our military overseas, parents who are not able to 
witness this today but who supported you, and then spouses and 
children who have been a part of your career of service.
    Thank you all for what you do to represent our nation in 
difficult, distant, dangerous parts of the world and know that 
all of us in the Senate appreciate your service.
    The record for this hearing will remain open until 
tomorrow, the close of business on Thursday, July 28th. So for 
any staff who are listening, make sure any questions for the 
record are submitted no later than Thursday.
    And with that, this confirmation hearing is adjourned.


    [Whereupon, at 12:50 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]



                              ----------                              



              Additional Material Submitted for the Record


       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
            to Hon. Puneet Talwar by Senator Robert Menendez

Bilateral Relationship
    Question. As U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of Morocco, you will be 
responsible for representing not only America's strategic interests and 
priorities, but also American values. One of the more contentious 
aspects of the U.S.-Morocco relationship is the issue of human rights.

   How do you plan on engaging with the Moroccan Government regarding 
        human rights concerns, particularly as it pertains to free 
        speech and the rights of activists in the Western Sahara?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will prioritize human rights and directly 
engage the Government of Morocco to raise concerns including 
allegations of mistreatment of detainees by security forces; 
restrictions on the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, 
association, and religion; and discrimination against women. This will 
include human concerns in Western Sahara. The United States maintains a 
dialogue on human rights issues with the Government of Morocco and with 
members of Moroccan civil society. If confirmed, I will participate in 
these dialogues with other colleagues in the State Department. I also 
will meet regularly with civil society groups and advocates for human 
rights and encourage my team to do the same. The President and the 
Secretary have been clear that our relationships with all our partners 
will be more sustainable with improvements on human rights. If 
confirmed, I will continue to work closely with Moroccan leaders to 
protect human rights, in line with Morocco's international commitments.

Normalization with Israel
    Question. Last week, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief Aviv Kochavi 
visited Morocco, building on normalization efforts between Morocco and 
Israel.

   As part of the Administration's efforts to increase regional 
        cooperation, how do you plan on working with both Moroccan and 
        Israeli officials to enhance security integration and 
        cooperation? How do you see relations between the two countries 
        evolving?

    Answer. Morocco-Israel ties have already created real benefits for 
both countries. Business relations are growing rapidly, and direct 
flights have started, making it easier for hundreds of thousands of 
Israelis of Moroccan decent to visit the land of their ancestors. 
Morocco became the first Arab country to sign a defense cooperation 
agreement with Israel and the Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense 
Forces recently made a landmark visit to Morocco. In March, Moroccan 
Foreign Minister Bourita joined with Secretary Blinken and foreign 
ministers from Bahrain, Egypt, and the UAE at the historic Negev 
Summit. The meeting launched the Negev Forum, a framework for regional 
integration and cooperation, including working groups on regional 
security, food and water security, education, health, tourism, and 
clean energy. If confirmed, I will look for opportunities to work with 
Morocco to further expand the circle of peace and cooperation with 
Israel in the region, including in the area of security integration and 
cooperation.

Food Security
    Question. Many countries in the Middle East and North Africa 
continue to experience surging prices and the shortage of essential 
food supplies as a result of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine. 
Increasing prices have led to widespread anger and social unrest in the 
region many times before, most notably during the Arab Spring.

   What is your assessment of the current global food security crisis, 
        particularly as it pertains to Morocco, and how can the U.S. 
        mitigate the short and long-term effects in the region? If 
        confirmed, what role do you see yourself playing in mitigating 
        these effects?

    Answer. Morocco is currently suffering from what may be the worst 
drought in 30 years and the rise in the price of wheat as a result of 
Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Morocco is likely to increase its wheat 
imports from five million tons to six million tons but at this point 
the Government is confident there will be no disruptions to domestic 
supply or a reduction in wheat subsidies. Morocco received four percent 
of its wheat imports from Russia and 20 percent from Ukraine in 2021. 
If confirmed, I will carefully monitor the situation and work with 
colleagues in Washington to support Morocco's food security.

Anomalous Health Incidents
    Question. I am very concerned about directed energy attacks on U.S. 
Government personnel (so-called Anomalous Health Incidents). Ensuring 
the safety and security of our personnel abroad falls largely on 
individual Chiefs of Mission and the response of officers at post. It 
is imperative that any individual who reports a suspected incident be 
responded to promptly, equitably, and compassionately.

   Do you agree these incidents must be taken seriously, and pose a 
        threat to the health of U.S. personnel?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to ensuring that any reported 
incident is treated seriously and reported quickly through the 
appropriate channels, and that any affected individuals receive prompt 
access to medical care?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I will have no higher priority than the 
safety and well-being of Mission personnel and will work in close 
partnership with the Department's AHI Coordinator, the Department's 
Health Incident Response Task Force, and the broader government-wide 
effort to ensure the full resources of the U.S. Government are brought 
to bear to get to the bottom of these incidents and to ensure access to 
needed care for those affected.

    Question. Do you commit to meeting with medical staff and the RSO 
at post to discuss any past reported incidents and ensure that all 
protocols are being followed?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I would be committed to providing 
Mission Morocco personnel with the most up-to-date information 
available, as we learn more, including guidance on how to respond if 
they have concerns that they might have experienced an incident and how 
to access medical care.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
            to Hon. Puneet Talwar by Senator James E. Risch

Policy Priorities
    Question. Please outline your policy priorities and objectives as 
the United States Ambassador to Morocco.

    Answer. Morocco's commitment to our strategic partnership 
undergirds U.S. security goals in the region and generates dividends 
across a range of U.S. national and regional security equities. If 
confirmed, ensuring the safety and security of the Embassy and 
Consulate teams and American citizens in Morocco, helping Morocco and 
Israel cement their growing relationship, support for a political 
solution for Western Sahara through a U.N.-led process, building on our 
strong security partnership, enhancing our economic ties including 
through advocacy for American business and exports, and increasing 
protection for human rights would be my policy priority areas.

Western Sahara
    Question. The Trump administration reversed longstanding U.S. 
policy on Western Sahara in exchange for Morocco's entry into the 
Abraham Accords and normalization with Israel. Previously, the United 
States had recognized neither Morocco's claim, nor the self-declared 
government led by the independence-seeking Polisario Front.

   Do you consider the Trump administration's recognition of Moroccan 
        sovereignty over Western Sahara a positive or negative 
        development?

    Answer. I believe that there is no substitute for a negotiated 
solution that can provide an enduring and dignified resolution for the 
people of Western Sahara and the region. In my judgment, it is positive 
that the U.N. relaunched a negotiations process in 2021 led by U.N. 
Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General Staffan de Mistura; that the 
parties, neighboring states, and international partners have lent their 
full support to this political process and engaged with the Personal 
Envoy in good faith; and that violence that rekindled in 2020 with the 
suspension of the ceasefire has ebbed. The previous administration's 
statements are a historical fact, and if confirmed, I will place my 
emphasis on working in support of the U.N. and together with 
international partners to advance a credible political process able to 
garner broad international support.

    Question. Do you consider the Trump administration's decision on 
Western Sahara as reversible?

    Answer. On December 10, 2020, the previous administration issued a 
presidential proclamation that recognized Morocco's sovereignty over 
Western Sahara. While I am not in a position to offer a legal analysis, 
I am not aware of any restrictions that would in principle preclude the 
current or a future administration from evaluating a previously issued 
presidential proclamation. The previous administration's statements are 
a historical fact, and if confirmed, I would place my emphasis on fully 
supporting the U.N.-led diplomatic process for Western Sahara.

    Question. As a consequence of the U.S. decision to grant Moroccan 
sovereignty over Western Sahara, what is an appropriate U.S. consulate 
presence? Brick and mortar, virtual or none at all?

    Answer. My understanding is that Mission Morocco is able to fulfill 
its mission with the current posture of a U.S. Embassy in Rabat and 
Consulate-General in Casablanca. Personnel assigned to the Mission 
regularly travel to Western Sahara and directly engage with both 
Moroccan Government officials and non-government organizations, 
including civil society and human rights activists. In addition, we 
continue to host a virtual presence post for Western Sahara. If 
confirmed, I will work to ensure that the Mission is able to provide 
timely and accurate reporting on the full range of issues in Western 
Sahara.

    Question. MINURSO efforts to find a political solution to Western 
Sahara have yielded uneven results. What is your characterization of 
MINURSO's effectiveness and how would you set conditions for a 
political solution?

    Answer. As penholder at the U.N. Security Council for MINURSO and 
Western Sahara, the United States' focus is on ensuring that the 
mandate allows the U.N.-led process to advance a political solution 
that can deliver tangible results for the people of Western Sahara and 
the region. While my understanding is that the Administration strongly 
supports the U.N.-led process and the efforts of the U.N. Personal 
Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara who leads it, no 
solution to the dispute can be imposed. My understanding is the 
Administration aims to fully empower the MINURSO mission and the 
Personal Envoy to effectively carry out their roles in support of 
achieving a political solution. If confirmed, I will support the 
efforts of the Personal Envoy and work with the Moroccan Government to 
support the achievement of a political solution.

    Question. What are the prospects and regional implications of a 
warm peace or detente between Algeria and Morocco?

    Answer. The United States views Morocco and Algeria as valued 
partners and hopes that tensions can be reduced and diplomatic 
relations restored. Improving relations, while a long-term process, 
could eventually enable both countries to better address shared 
bilateral and regional issues such as terrorism, illegal migration, 
drug trafficking, and trade integration.

Abraham Accords
    Question. Morocco's normalization with Israel has the potential to 
reap significant economic and security benefits.

   Please outline your thoughts on Morocco's normalization with Israel 
        and plans to expand and strengthen this relationship.

    Answer. Morocco-Israel ties have already created real benefits for 
both countries. Business relations are growing rapidly, and direct 
flights have started, making it easier for hundreds of thousands of 
Israelis of Moroccan decent to visit the land of their ancestors. In 
March, Moroccan Foreign Minister Bourita joined with Secretary Blinken 
and foreign ministers from Bahrain, Egypt, and the UAE at the historic 
Negev Summit. The meeting launched the Negev Forum, a framework for 
regional integration and cooperation, including working groups on 
regional security, food and water security, education, health, tourism, 
and clean energy. If confirmed, I will work to engage with Morocco, 
Israel, and other countries in the region to normalize relations and 
look for other opportunities to expand integration and cooperation 
among countries in the region.

Mil-to-Mil Relationship
    Question. Select members of Congress have sought to curtail the 
U.S.-Morocco mil-to-mil relationship over Western Sahara concerns--even 
as far as to reject Moroccan participation in AFRICOM's capstone 
exercise African Lion.

   Please provide your perspectives on the mil-to-mil relationship 
        with Morocco and implications for limiting that relationship.

    Answer. Morocco has been a steadfast security partner. Morocco's 
relationship with the United States encompasses nearly every U.S. 
security and strategic interest in the region. Morocco occupies a vital 
geographic strategic position, is one of AFRICOM's most capable 
partners on the continent, participating in over 100 military-to-
military engagements yearly, and hosts AFRICAN LION--the largest 
military exercise on the African continent. These military exercises 
strengthen interoperability between AFRICOM and more than 40 partner 
nations and enhance our collective readiness. In addition, Morocco 
continues to be a major customer for new U.S. equipment, with billions 
of dollars in planned purchases in the coming decade. If confirmed, I 
will work with AFRICOM to expand upon Morocco's role as a security 
exporter for the region and enhance our already strong security 
cooperation

Economy
    Question. Many U.S. companies have bemoaned Moroccan barriers to 
entry that create an unfavorable economic environment to include 
excessive bureaucracy, intellectual property issues, and pursuit of 
criminal litigation against American companies.

   Please outline your understanding of Morocco's economic state, 
        barriers to entry for foreign investment, strategy to improve 
        these conditions.

    Answer. The World Bank ranked Morocco 53rd for ease of doing 
business in 2020. Morocco has made progress in implementing macro-
economic policies, trade liberalization, investment incentives, and 
structural reforms to encourage foreign investment, particularly in 
export sectors. However, U.S. companies remain concerned about 
regulatory barriers, digital and intellectual property issues, and 
access to financing in Morocco. U.S. Government assistance supports 
Moroccan Government efforts to address these issues and increase 
transparency and accountability and Mission Morocco engages with key 
government and civil society actors in the field of anti-corruption. 
King Mohammed VI's reform plan, the New Development Model, seeks to 
simplify administrative regulations and encourage foreign investment. 
If confirmed, I will make it a priority to identify new areas to help 
advance economic reforms in Morocco, and advocate for U.S. business and 
exports.

Human Rights, Democracy, and International Organizations
    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons 
Report, Morocco was identified to be Tier 2 for not fully meeting the 
minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. One key area of 
failure was a lack of proactive screening of migrants and other 
vulnerable populations and identification measures, which leave 
populations vulnerable to penalization for unlawful acts which 
traffickers compelled them to commit.

   How can you work with the host government and the Moroccan Security 
        Forces to increase their capacity for proactive measures?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will urge the Moroccan Government to 
increase its efforts to investigate and prosecute potential trafficking 
crimes, to proactively identify trafficking victims, and to provide 
specialized protection services catering to the needs of trafficking 
victims. Specifically, I will urge the Government to finalize, approve, 
and implement standardized victim identification procedures and a 
national victim referral mechanism.

    Question. Both Spain and Moroccan Governments have identified 
trafficking groups as likely to have played an influential role in the 
recent border crossing incident at Melilla, what steps would you take 
as Ambassador to help Morocco improve its efforts to meet the minimum 
standards for the elimination of trafficking?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work to identify ways the United 
States can support ongoing Moroccan efforts to address the challenges 
of migration, human smuggling, border security, and trafficking in 
persons.

    Question. Morocco has deepened relations with Israel after 
normalization in 2020 through high level official visits. As a largely 
Islamic state, King Mohammed VI officially recognized the Jewish 
community as part of Moroccan culture.

   What is your assessment of the King's recognition and prospects of 
        religious freedoms in Morocco?

    Answer. The Moroccan constitution provides for freedom of worship 
and freedom of conscience. Morocco has a long tradition of religious 
tolerance and coexistence, particularly between Muslim and historic 
Jewish communities. When Secretary Blinken released this year's annual 
religious freedom report, he highlighted Morocco as an example of 
progress on religious freedom. He noted that Morocco launched an 
initiative to renovate Jewish heritage sites and to include Jewish 
history in the Moroccan public-school curriculum.. If confirmed, I will 
support Morocco's efforts to respect the historic Jewish community in 
Morocco and encourage religious freedom for all faiths in the country.

    Question. What actions would you take with the host government to 
continue to expand this opening of religious freedom in the country?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will engage on this important issue in 
three key areas. First, I will work to identify ways the United States 
can support religious freedom. Second, I will engage with a wide 
variety of religious leaders in Morocco and maintains an active 
dialogue with the Moroccan Government on religious freedom issues. 
Third, I will stress the importance of the equal and transparent 
application of the laws governing religious organizations.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 Report on International 
Religious Freedom, only Sunni Muslims and Jews are recognized by the 
King. Many Shia Muslims and other minority groups fear registration for 
reprisals by the Sunni majority.

   If confirmed, how will you engage with the host government and 
        civil society on strengthening the societal and governmental 
        respect for international religious freedom?

    Answer. belief for members of religious minority groups. I would 
meet with government officials, including from the Ministries of 
Interior (MOI) and Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs (MEIA), 
to stress the importance of religious freedom and tolerance, including 
the rights of minority communities. I would also hold regular meetings 
and discussions with members of religious minority and majority 
communities throughout the country and direct embassy and consulate-
general representatives to highlight the importance of protecting 
members of religious minority groups and interfaith dialogue.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 Human Rights Report, 
Morocco was noted to have credible reports of significant human rights 
abuses such as torture or degrading treatment by security forces, 
serious restrictions on free expression, substantial interference of 
the freedom of assembly and association, and criminalization of LGBTQI 
conduct.

   If confirmed, what steps will you take to continue to address these 
        concerns with the host government?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will prioritize promoting human rights in 
my engagement, including respect for freedom of speech, assembly, and 
association. I will encourage legislative reforms to protect human 
rights, including freedom of expression, in line with Morocco's 
international commitments. I also will work with the Moroccan 
Government to address concerns regarding actions by members of the 
security forces and ensure it can fulfill its commitments and 
responsibilities to its people. The promotion of the human rights of 
LGBTQI+ persons will be one of my highest priorities, including the 
reduction of discrimination and violence against LGBTQI+ persons and 
working toward decriminalization of same-sex status and conduct. I 
would use Pride Month as an opportunity to promote LGBTQI+ rights.

    Question. How will you direct your embassy to work with civil 
society organizations to improve the human rights situation on the 
ground?

    Answer. If confirmed, promoting human rights will be among my 
highest priorities. I will meet regularly with human rights defenders, 
civil society activists, and other non-governmental organizations in 
the United States and in Morocco and I will direct members of the 
Embassy staff to do the same.

    Question. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the U.N., including in elections 
for specialized bodies like the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who if 
elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. 
She is in a tough race that will require early, consistent engagement 
across capitals and within the U.N. member states.

   If confirmed, do you commit to demarching the Moroccan Government 
        and any other counterparts necessary to encourage their support 
        of Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to demarching the Moroccan 
Government in support of Ms. Bogdan-Martin and working to educate 
Moroccan Government interlocutors on the importance of her candidacy.

    Question. If confirmed, how can you work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify, recruit, 
and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior Program 
Officer (JPO) program at the U.N.?

    Answer. The Junior Professional Officer program is one of the key 
opportunities offered by the U.N. to encourage young professionals 
interested in serving in international organizations, and it provides 
them with hands-on experience across various U.N. agencies. If 
confirmed, I will coordinate closely with my colleagues in the 
International Organization Affairs Bureau and other stakeholders to 
ensure we have sufficient resources, tools, and staffing to support 
more positions for American citizen JPOs in the U.N. system. With these 
resources, we can work strategically to increase the number of JPO 
opportunities funded by the U.S. Government into key agencies and 
bodies that work on U.S. priorities, expand our recruitment and 
outreach activities to ensure these opportunities are widely known and 
available to interested U.S. citizens, and provide tools and services 
to strengthen our competitiveness in placing qualified American 
citizens into the U.N. system.

    Question. Morocco had a 21 percent rate of voting coincidence with 
the U.S. in the U.N. General Assembly and in the Security Council in 
2021.

   What is your assessment of this issue?

    Answer. If confirmed I will maintain close consultations with the 
Moroccan Government on issues at the United Nations and advocate for 
their support of U.S. positions. In my view, direct engagement with 
senior officials in capital can be an effective way to advocate for 
support at the United Nations.

    Question. If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to 
engage with the Moroccans on anticipated votes in the U.N. system that 
would increase their voting coincidence with the U.S.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will develop close coordination with our 
mission at the United Nations to enhance our direct messaging with the 
Moroccan Government interlocutors in Rabat and emphasize the importance 
of issues and votes at the United Nations.

State Department Management and Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID.

   What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission Rabat?

    Answer. My understanding is that morale throughout Mission Morocco 
is very good. Traditional indicators such as staff retention rates, 
support this understanding. If confirmed, I look forward to working 
closely with the entire Mission team to identify and resolve issues 
which adversely affect staff morale.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Rabat?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will stress open communication and 
inclusivity to ensure that we continuously identify and address the 
concerns of all Mission team members by utilizing every tool and 
resources available from the Department. Collectively, we will maintain 
a safe, supportive work culture that empowers and develops our 
colleagues.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Rabat?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will make it a priority to create a shared 
vision and effort that advances U.S. interests consistent with the 
Integrated Country Strategy (ICS). I would engage with all components 
of the Mission to seek their input on priorities, and I would follow up 
regularly to ensure execution and to make any necessary adjustments.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. Over the course of my career in government, I have had the 
opportunity to lead diverse, talented, interagency teams. My style is 
inclusive, and I seek to impart values of respect, integrity, and 
collegiality while also setting high standards. I listen to team 
members who have expertise. I encourage fresh thinking and constructive 
debate. I believe in achieving outcomes, setting clear objectives, and 
empowering my team to accomplish our shared goals while ensuring that 
they understand their work is connected to the larger enterprise. I 
believe in recognizing team members for their work, and I believe in 
fostering their career development and personal growth.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. It is never acceptable to berate subordinates. If 
confirmed, I commit to building a positive and inclusive work 
environment that empowers employees.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. A successful relationship between an ambassador and a 
Deputy Chief of Mission is critical to a successful diplomatic mission. 
If confirmed, I envision a relationship that features close 
coordination, partnership, and strong communication on the full range 
of mission issues, both internal and external. 

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will forge a close partnership with my 
Deputy Chief of Mission. I would empower her to be the chief operating 
officer of Mission Morocco. This extends beyond internal management. 
The Deputy Chief of Mission must play an important policy, diplomatic, 
and strategic role, including stepping in for the ambassador when 
absent from post. She must be seen as empowered in the eyes of Mission 
team members and the Moroccan Government so that she is seen as 
speaking authoritatively for the Ambassador and the United States.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to encouraging improvement in 
employee performance and recognizing achievement within Mission 
Morocco. The development of a motivated and effective workforce is 
critical for the effective diplomacy necessary to advance U.S. 
interests.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I will work closely with my Deputy Chief 
of Mission, consul general in Casablanca, and management team to 
recognize the success of staff and identify and develop strategies 
where there are opportunities for growth and improvement. Accurate, 
constructive feedback and rewarding success are essential tools in 
improving performance.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Morocco.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. I agree that it is imperative for U.S. diplomats be visible 
outside of diplomatic compounds to meet with the local actors in order 
to advance American interests and values. This includes engagement with 
a wide range of interlocutors including in rural and underserved areas, 
women, youth, and vulnerable populations. Our ability to engage these 
audiences is crucial to furthering our overall foreign policy goals and 
essential to fully accomplishing our mission. If confirmed, I will 
encourage Mission Morocco team members to engage widely and often 
outside of diplomatic compounds.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I intend to lead by example and will seek 
every opportunity to engage with local populations throughout the 
country. U.S. assistance and public diplomacy programs are focused on 
supporting rural populations, women, youth, and underserved 
populations, and I pledge to publicly support those programs through 
visits and direct engagement with beneficiaries, local NGOs, and local 
governments helping to support and implement these programs. In 
addition, Mission Morocco boasts a robust Peace Corps program, which 
will welcome sixty volunteers back to Morocco in September 2022 and 
will be hosting one of the largest Peace Corps programs worldwide in 
this challenging post-pandemic era. Throughout the Mission I will 
encourage staff to continue their engagement with local populations and 
in ensuring the best possible reporting accurately which reflects a 
wide variety of opinions throughout the country.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts.

   What is the public diplomacy environment like in Morocco?

    Answer. Morocco is a major non-NATO ally, a Free Trade Agreement 
partner, an ally in countering violent extremism, and provides a 
supportive environment for U.S. engagement. A solid majority of the 
Moroccan public has favorable attitudes toward the United States and 
strong majorities support closer economic ties and security 
cooperation. Moroccans hold the U.S. education system, job creation, 
and U.S. technology in high regard. Morocco is home to one of State 
Department's Near East Asia Bureau's largest Fulbright programs and 
benefits from an extensive alumni network. The public diplomacy 
environment in Morocco is rich with opportunity to engage local 
populations through traditional media, social media, and local 
programming. Dar America, the American Space in Casablanca, plus the 
American Space in Oujda, are key platforms for engaging youth on U.S. 
society, entrepreneurship, values, and policies. If confirmed, I will 
take an active role in public diplomacy and encourage Mission Morocco 
team members to do the same.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. My understanding is that local challenges include high 
unemployment, political disengagement, and general pessimism among 
youth which affect our capacity to fully engage those audiences. While 
older Moroccans have positive general attitudes toward the United 
States, they are more skeptical when it comes to specific policy issues 
such as trade with the U.S. or U.S. counterterrorism efforts. U.S. 
public diplomacy efforts in Morocco also face competition from the 
People's Republic of China (PRC), who have three Confucius Institutes 
in Morocco and sponsor academic scholarships and academies that provide 
technology training and education. If confirmed, I will work to expand 
and highlight Mission Morocco's efforts in these areas.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would direct that Mission Morocco's public 
messaging campaigns remain first and foremost centered around U.S. 
foreign policy objectives. I would seek to deliver clear messages in 
such a way that our local audiences understand our perspective and 
policy agenda. To ensure unity of messaging, I would ensure the 
Mission's public diplomacy team works closely with Washington public 
affairs teams to ensure that our official communication is clear and 
relevant for local audiences.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I will have no higher priority than the 
safety and well-being of Mission personnel and will work in close 
partnership with the Department's AHI Coordinator, the Department's 
Health Incident Response Task Force, and the broader government-wide 
effort to ensure the full resources of the U.S. Government are brought 
to bear to get to the bottom of these incidents and to ensure access to 
needed care for those affected.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Rabat personnel?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would be committed to providing Mission 
Morocco personnel with the most up-to-date information available, as we 
learn more, including guidance on how to respond if they have concerns 
that they might have experienced an incident and how to access medical 
care.



                               __________


       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
              to Hon. Puneet Talwar by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. Whether we want it or not, the United States is currently 
engaged in a great power competition with the Chinese Communist Party. 
Officials from the past and current administrations have agreed that 
the CCP is the only power willing and able to challenge U.S. leadership 
on the global stage. In practice, this means undermining our open 
system here at home and undermining our alliances and credibility 
abroad. While CCP is most interested in becoming a regional hegemon in 
the Indo-Pacific, they have global aspirations. In January, Morocco 
became just the latest North African country to sign an agreement to 
join the CCP's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) through an implementation 
accord.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. As Secretary Blinken said on May 26, we will compete with 
the People's Republic of China (PRC) to defend our interests and build 
our vision for the future. If confirmed, I will carefully monitor CCP 
activity and use the full range of tools provided by Congress to invest 
in our partnership with Morocco to ensure we remain the partner of 
choice on a range of economic and security issues. I will actively 
engage the Moroccan Government to highlight the risks associated with 
People's Republic of China (PRC) engagement that could impact Morocco's 
security and sovereignty as well as U.S. interests, and I will ensure 
that our vision of a positive partnership and regional security and 
prosperity competes successfully with the PRC.

    Question. Is rising CCP influence in Morocco a threat to the United 
States?

    Answer. The People's Republic of China (PRC) has increased efforts 
in recent years to deepen ties with Morocco. PRC companies are active 
in the technology and infrastructure sectors, and I believe these 
activities merit careful attention and action so that they do not 
undermine American interests. If confirmed, I will use the full range 
of tools provided by Congress such as the Development Finance 
Corporation to increase our engagement with Morocco to provide free-
market, transparent, and sustainable solutions to Morocco's economic 
development needs. I will expand our efforts to promote a fair and 
equitable business climate for the benefit of U.S. investors and the 
security of our Allies and partners. I will also strive to engage and 
educate Moroccan public and private sector decision makers on the 
implications of PRC engagement in key areas such as 5G technology.

    Question. Is the CCP expanding the Belt and Road Initiative to 
Morocco in order to be in a position to control trade flowing through 
the strategic Strait of Gibraltar? If so, is this concerning?

    Answer. The President has made it clear the United States views the 
People's Republic of China (PRC) as a strategic competitor that 
challenges the existing rules-based international order. Current direct 
investment from the PRC in Morocco totals $380 million and is focused 
on infrastructure, communications, and fishing. This reflects an effort 
by the PRC to encourage large PRC companies to set up or invest in 
Morocco--particularly in automotive, aerospace, technology, 
agriculture, and technology sectors. If confirmed, I would promote a 
vision of inclusive, open economic growth and stronger ties with U.S. 
companies.

    Question. If the CCP is in a position to control trade through the 
strait, how could that be used to strangle U.S. trade with Europe?

    Answer. The Tanger-Med port, located directly in the Strait of 
Gibraltar, is the 27th busiest container port in the world and a major 
priority for growth for the Moroccan Government. The Development 
Finance Corporation (DFC) has recently worked with LixCap on the 
development of a cold storage facility at the Tangier-Med port that 
will have regional transportation implications. If confirmed, I will 
work with the DFC and others in the United States Government to advance 
opportunities for U.S. businesses in logistics, maritime shipping, and 
transportation and work to prevent the PRC from moving into a position 
in which they would control or significantly influence trade through 
the strait.

    Question. Morocco is a signatory of the historic Abraham Accords, 
which the previous administration used to normalize relations between 
Israel and Muslim nations in the Middle East. Improving ties between 
Israel, our strongest ally in the region, and other American partners 
is vital for our national security. A security coalition including 
Israel would be better able to take on the many counter-terrorism 
priorities in the Middle East and stand up to the Ayatollahs in Iran. 
If confirmed, how would you work to build upon the foundations of the 
Abraham Accords?

    Answer. Building on the foundation of the Abraham Accords, the 
foreign ministers of Morocco, Israel, Bahrain, Egypt, the UAE, and 
Secretary Blinken met for the Negev summit in March. The participants 
agreed to form the Negev Forum, a framework for regional cooperation, 
including working groups on regional security, education, health, food 
and water security, tourism, and clean energy. If confirmed, I will 
prioritize Morocco's active participation in the Negev Forum and fully 
support the deepening ties between Morocco and Israel. Morocco became 
the first Arab country to sign a defense cooperation agreement with 
Israel and the Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces recently 
made a landmark visit to Morocco. If confirmed, I will look for 
opportunities to work with Morocco to further expand the circle of 
peace and cooperation with Israel in the region, including in the area 
of security cooperation.

    Question. What is the status of Morocco meeting its goals and 
commitments under the Abraham Accords?

    Answer. Morocco-Israel ties have already created real benefits for 
both countries. Business relations are growing rapidly, and direct 
flights have started, making it easier for hundreds of thousands of 
Israelis of Moroccan decent to visit the land of their ancestors.
    Morocco and Israel have signed dozens of memorandums of 
understanding in a wide range of areas including defense, tourism, 
investment, culture, and energy. Seven Israel cabinet level officials 
have visited Morocco and in March, Moroccan Foreign Minister Bourita 
joined with Secretary Blinken and foreign ministers from Bahrain, 
Egypt, and the UAE at the historic Negev Summit. If confirmed, I will 
prioritize support for Morocco's deepening relationship with Israel.

    Question. What can Congress do to further support improving ties 
between Israel and Morocco?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will consult with your office and other 
members of the committee to identify opportunities for Congressional 
action, whether through engagement or legislation, on improving ties 
between Israel and Morocco. I believe that it is critical to translate 
diplomatic agreements into tangible benefits that are felt by ordinary 
people so that we can consolidate progress and further expand the 
circle of peace. If confirmed, I would welcome the opportunity to host 
you or members for your staff in Morocco to directly work together on 
this critically important issue.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
              to Hon. Puneet Talwar by Senator Todd Young

    Question. How can we leverage the sustained success of the African 
Lion Exercise and deeper connections and interoperability with Morocco 
to encourage them to bring more to the counterterror fight in the Sahel 
and West Africa?

    Answer. Morocco is a valuable partner in the Global Coalition to 
Defeat ISIS and has contributed F-16s to the Coalition's efforts, as 
well as a field hospital that has treated more than one million Syrian 
refugees in Jordan. On May 9-11 Morocco hosted the D-ISIS Ministerial 
in Marrakech and is co-chair of the Africa Focus working group. Morocco 
is also co-chair of the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) and 
supports the efforts of other partners in Africa to build their 
counterterrorism capacity. Morocco is one of AFRICOM's most capable 
partners on the continent, participating in over 100 military-to-
military engagements yearly, and hosts AFRICAN LION--the largest 
military exercise on the African continent. These military exercises 
strengthen interoperability between AFRICOM and more than 40 partner 
nations and enhance our collective readiness. If confirmed, I will work 
with AFRICOM to expand upon Morocco's role as a security exporter for 
the region, including amplifying and encouraging Morocco's efforts on 
counterterrorism and security for the Sahel and West Africa

    Question. What is your view of Western Sahara and the U.N.-led 
political process, and how would you plan to engage on this issue, if 
confirmed? Who do you believe is the driver of the political impasse 
there?

    Answer. I believe that there is no substitute for a negotiated 
solution that can provide an enduring and dignified resolution for the 
people of Western Sahara and the region. In my judgment, it is positive 
that the U.N. relaunched a negotiations process in 2021 led by U.N. 
Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General Staffan de Mistura; that the 
parties, neighboring states, and international partners have lent their 
full support to this political process and engaged with the Personal 
Envoy in good faith; and that violence that rekindled in 2020 with the 
suspension of the ceasefire has ebbed. If confirmed, I will place my 
emphasis on working in support of the U.N. and together with 
international partners to advance a credible political process able to 
garner broad international support.

    Question. If confirmed, how would you work with the Department to 
move forward on establishment of diplomatic presence in the Western 
Sahara?

    Answer. My understanding is that Mission Morocco is able to fulfill 
its mission with the current posture of a U.S. Embassy in Rabat and 
Consulate-General in Casablanca. Personnel assigned to the Mission 
regularly travel to Western Sahara and directly engage with both 
Moroccan Government officials and non-government organizations, 
including civil society and human rights activists. In addition, we 
continue to host a virtual presence post for Western Sahara. If 
confirmed, I will work to ensure that the Mission is able to provide 
timely and accurate reporting on the full range of issues in Western 
Sahara.

    Question. A Moroccan company with connections to the royal family 
is attempting to criminalize a civil dispute stems from the management 
of the Royal Mansour Hotel in Casablanca, which could subject American 
executives of the corporate owners of this hotel to potential criminal 
liability in Morocco, if prosecution continues. How would you engage 
the Moroccan Government on this matter to ensure a safe environment for 
the conduct of private business?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to being a strong advocate on 
these issues and would be an advocate for the U.S. business community 
directly with the Moroccan Government. I would strongly urge Morocco to 
avoid counter-productive actions and to improve the country's business 
climate and economic legislative framework, particularly for American 
companies doing business in Morocco and to promote further commercial 
opportunities for U.S. companies.

            to Dr. Jonathan Henick by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has had somewhat 
diminished influence in Central Asia as it focuses its diplomatic 
efforts elsewhere. This has opened a window of opportunity for 
increased U.S. involvement in Uzbekistan.

   In what ways can the United States best take advantage of this 
        opportunity and lay a foundation for continued and permanent 
        progress in the U.S.-Uzbekistan relationship?

    Answer. Support for Uzbekistan's independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity is the foundation of U.S. policy towards 
Uzbekistan. The Kremlin's war in Ukraine has already resulted in 
terrible human costs, and if Russia does not pay a heavy price for its 
actions, it will put the survival of other peaceful countries at risk. 
We welcome the Government of Uzbekistan's refusal to recognize the 
independence of the so-called Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics in 
Ukraine. If confirmed, I will ensure that our shared understanding of 
Ukraine's sovereignty remains a key issue in our bilateral 
relationship.
    Although the Russian Federation continues to be Uzbekistan's 
largest trade and investment partner and an important source of 
remittances, it is increasingly clear that Uzbekistan's ability to 
secure a more prosperous future rests on its ability to diversify its 
economic relationships. The United States is uniquely positioned to 
support Uzbekistan in this effort, which presents an historic 
opportunity to strengthen U.S. influence in Central Asia. U.S. support 
for Uzbekistan's accession to the World Trade Organization is 
particularly important in this regard. Finally, I will also underscore 
to Uzbekistani authorities the importance of working together to 
strengthen international sanctions and export controls introduced in 
response to Russia's further invasion of Ukraine.

    Question. How will you work with Uzbekistan's Government and 
private sector to increase economic ties with the United States?

    Answer. The United States is committed to supporting Uzbekistan's 
economic reform agenda, diversification of trading partners, and 
connections to the international economy. If nominated, I will urge 
Uzbekistani officials to strengthen intellectual property protections, 
combat corruption, improve the investment climate, and follow through 
on its stated goal of acceding to the WTO. The United States is helping 
increase the performance of small and medium enterprises throughout the 
country, with particular focus on women's empowerment, building 
Uzbekistan's ability to deliver prosperity to its people and to attract 
more direct foreign investment. The Department of State has also 
encouraged Uzbekistan to identify private sector projects suitable for 
U.S. Development Finance Corporation investments, which, if approved, 
will help build confidence in the viability of Uzbekistan's private 
sector.

    Question. As Ambassador, how will you work to build people-to-
people ties between the U.S. and Uzbekistan, particularly to counter 
Russian influence?

    Answer. Uzbekistan enjoys a rich cultural history and is truly the 
gem of Central Asia. People-to-people ties over the last 30 years have 
helped build mutual understanding between the people of the United 
States and Uzbekistan. If confirmed, I look forward to expanding these 
ties. Since 2018, the United States has worked closely with Uzbekistan 
to dramatically expand English language instruction across the country. 
Our American Corners throughout the country offer cultural programs, 
educational resources, and information on studying in the United States 
to tens of thousands of people per year. I also look forward, if 
confirmed, to further expanding English-language programming in 
Uzbekistan, which will help to open Uzbekistani audiences to 
alternatives to Russian state media..

    Question. Independent journalism that helps the public hold 
governments and corrupted elites accountable for their actions is under 
threat throughout Central Asia, and impacts the work of Congressionally 
funded international media outlets such as RFE/RL. Throughout the 
region, governments do not consistently respond to requests for 
comments and interviews on questions of interest to RFE/RL's audiences 
in the region, and local journalists working for RFE/RL are regularly 
targeted for retaliation for their journalistic work.
    In Uzbekistan, the Government has blocked access to the website of 
RFE/RL's Uzbek Service. The Government has yet to provide accreditation 
to local journalists who would like to work for RFE/RL in the country, 
or to grant RFE/RL permission to open a local bureau. Additionally, 
RFE/RL journalists (including their relatives) periodically suffer from 
smear and harassment campaigns, especially following impactful 
investigations.

   If you are confirmed as U.S. Ambassador, what will you do to 
        support the work of RFE/RL and ensure open access for 
        Congressionally-funded international journalists at your new 
        post?

    Answer. A free press is vital to the healthy functioning of nations 
in transition to more democratic forms of government. If confirmed, I 
will underscore to Uzbekistani officials the importance of media 
freedom, in line with our shared values and international commitments 
as participating states in the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe. I will call out the Government's ongoing 
crackdown on freedoms of expression, including for opposition bloggers, 
members of civil society, and journalists. We are proud of our growing 
support for Uzbekistani media, including support for the work of RFE/
RL, and I will commit to continuing our efforts in this space.

    Question. Corruption at all levels continues to be a problem in 
Uzbekistan.

   Do you think that the use of the State Department's 7031(c) visa 
        ban authorities could be a useful tool for fighting corruption 
        in Uzbekistan? Why or why not?

    Answer. Endemic corruption remains one of the most significant 
obstacles to the full realization of the Government of Uzbekistan's 
reform agenda. While many Uzbekistani officials appreciate the severity 
of the situation and the need for remedial action, there are many with 
vested interests in the status quo. If confirmed, I will ask Embassy's 
Country Team to keep all options on the table for combatting 
corruption, including 7031(c) visa restrictions, and related USAID and 
INL assistance programs, public messaging campaigns, as well as close 
interagency cooperation between the Departments of State, Treasury, and 
Justice.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you promote democratic and anti-
corruption reforms in Uzbekistan, and in what areas of government is 
progress most viable?

    Answer. The United States continues to encourage Uzbekistani 
leaders to stay the course and make more substantial progress on the 
program of reforms that began in 2016. Over the last six years, 
Uzbekistan has made significant progress modernizing its economy and 
ending the systematic practice of forced labor in the cotton harvest. 
However, much remains to be done to strengthen democratic institutions, 
the rule of law, and expand human rights protections. If confirmed, I 
will work to advance the rule of law and democratic governance and 
speak out against corruption and the Government's crackdown on freedoms 
of expression and association. Continued USAID and INL assistance 
programming is particularly valuable to making gains in this space.

    Question. On July 4, 2022, massive unrest turned violent in the 
autonomous region of Karakalpakstan concerning its sovereignty and 
right to secede. Eighteen were killed, 243 wounded, and over 500 were 
detained. To this day, an estimated 300 people remained detained from 
the incident.

   What is your assessment of this situation and how might you work 
        with the Uzbek Government to resolve tensions in the region?

    Answer. I welcome the Government of Uzbekistan's assurances of a 
transparent investigation under the auspices of a Parliamentary 
Commission led by the Office of the Ombudsman. The United States is 
very interested in the results of the Commission's work but also hears 
the concerns of civil society that it will not be impartial or fully 
empowered. It is important that the Commission conduct its work in a 
manner that is inclusive, thorough, and transparent. If confirmed, I 
will encourage the Government of Uzbekistan to also invite 
international human rights experts to review the Commission's 
investigation. Additionally, we have not lost sight of the fact that 
concerns over proposed reforms to Uzbekistan's constitution prompted 
the protests in Karakalpakstan in early July. Accordingly, we have 
urged the Government of Uzbekistan to invite an Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe Office of Democratic Institutions 
and Human Rights (ODIHR) Needs Assessment Mission to observe the 
referendum on the proposed reforms.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Human Rights report, 
Uzbekistan was noted for significant human rights abuses such as 
unlawful or arbitrary killings, torture, politically motivated 
reprisals, serious restrictions of expression and assembly, inability 
of the people to change their government peacefully, restrictions of 
political participation, trafficking in persons, criminalization of 
same-sex conduct, and significant restrictions to workers freedom.

   If confirmed, what steps would you take with the host government to 
        address these issues?

    Answer. The United States is committed to the ongoing program of 
human rights-related reforms that began in Uzbekistan in 2016. If 
confirmed, I pledge to advocate for independent and credible 
investigations of human rights abuses. I will also urger greater 
political pluralism and space for civil society.
    I agree with President Biden that everyone is entitled to dignity 
and equality, no matter who they are, whom they love, or how they 
identify. With regards to the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons, our 
foremost concern is to keep LGBTQI+ persons--and their allies--safe. We 
engage on these issues led by the ``do no harm'' principle--in concert 
with local members of the LGBTQI+ community and human rights defenders' 
goals.
    If confirmed, I will remain committed to raising the human rights 
of LGBTQI+ persons in our engagements with Uzbekistani interlocutors. 
We will continue to engage with allies and partners to advance respect 
for the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons. Additionally, I will continue 
to press for repeal of sections of the Criminal Code that criminalize 
consensual sexual relations between men and under which dozens of 
people are currently detained.

    Question. In the report, it was noted that prison conditions are, 
in some circumstances, harsh and life threatening due to food 
shortages, gross overcrowding, abuse, and inadequate sanitary 
conditions and medical care. Amidst the detaining of over several 
hundred additional prisoners, what would you do to address these 
conditions with the Uzbek Government?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will urge the Government of Uzbekistan to 
address longstanding concerns about the harsh conditions of its 
prisons. I will urge the Government to invite in, cooperate with, and 
take on the recommendations of international prison monitoring experts 
and, to the extent resources are available, will offer U.S. technical 
assistance in addressing inadequate prison conditions.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons 
report, Uzbekistan remained on Tier 2 for not fully meeting the minimum 
standards for the elimination of trafficking. One key area of failure 
was local officials in certain areas impose cotton quotas against the 
national ban of the practice. This incentivizes mobilization into 
cotton harvest forced labor, which is currently an administrative 
violation at first offense.

   If confirmed, how can you work with government officials to 
        increase the effectiveness of laws designed to inhibit these 
        forms of forced labor and larger anti-trafficking work in 
        country?

    Answer. Although there is more work to be done, the Government of 
Uzbekistan has made steady and significant progress towards eliminating 
the systemic forced labor issues of the Karimov era. If confirmed, I 
will encourage Uzbekistan's continued close cooperation with USAID and 
INL on U.S. technical assistance programs that combat human 
trafficking, including forced labor. I will also review and urge action 
to address the U.S. recommendations in the Department of State's annual 
Trafficking in Persons Report with members of Uzbekistan's National 
Commission to Combat Trafficking in Persons.

    Question. The report also notes that a lack of a victim-centered 
approach or victim/witness protections capabilities severely hinders 
efficient cooperation by victims and witnesses in investigations and 
prosecutions, if confirmed, what steps would you take with the Uzbek 
Government to improve upon these practices?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will encourage Uzbekistani officials to 
prioritize the implementation of the Department of State's 
recommendation in the annual TIP report, including the recommendation 
to adopt a victim-centered approach. Existing U.S.-funded technical 
assistance relationships with Uzbekistan provide a valuable resource in 
helping Uzbekistan adopt this recommended approach. If confirmed, I 
will stress the importance of this recommendation to Uzbekistani 
officials.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, while Uzbekistan's constitution recognizes the freedom 
of religion, a new version of the law on ``Freedom of Conscience and 
Religious Organizations'' notes that while exercise of religious 
freedom is permitted, the process of registration is difficult and many 
minority non-Muslim religious groups state they continue to face 
societal pressure from the majority Muslim population, particularly 
against members of their religious group whom converted from Islam.

   What actions would you take with the host government to encourage 
        the streamlining of these registration processes?

    Answer. Uzbekistan today is at a crossroads. Under President 
Mirziyoyev, the Government has taken significant steps to improve its 
record on religious freedom over the last several years. Based on these 
steps, the Department of State did not re-designate Uzbekistan as a 
Special Watch List country for severe violations of religious freedom 
in 2020. However, we have recently seen a softening of resolve to 
uphold the human right of religious freedom or belief in Uzbekistan. If 
confirmed, I will press Uzbekistani officials at the highest levels to 
stay the course on human rights-related reforms. I will engage directly 
with representatives of minority religious groups to better understand 
their concerns and will press Uzbekistani lawmakers and Ministry of 
Justice to streamline onerous registration procedures for religious 
groups.

    Question. The current religious laws outline that individuals in 
possession of authors deemed `extremist' or any literature illegally 
imported or produced are subject to arrest and prosecution. What is 
your assessment of the Government attitudes towards minority religious 
groups and their ability to feel secure in their practices under these 
types of laws?

    Answer. Uzbekistan's Soviet legacy casts a long shadow over its 
human rights reform efforts and societal tolerance of minority 
religious groups. Additionally, Uzbekistani officials openly admit that 
they defer to pressure from the Russian Orthodox Church not to register 
minority religious groups. If confirmed, I will underscore to 
Uzbekistani authorities the importance of freedom of religion or belief 
and more inclusive approaches to official treatment of minority 
religious groups.

    Question. Multiple sources in the report note excessively degrading 
and torturous treatment of prisoners of minority religious groups, what 
steps would you pursue to improve the treatment of such prisoners?

    Answer. If confirmed, pursuant to the Administration's stated goals 
and policies, I will encourage Uzbekistani authorities to conduct 
credible and transparent investigations of allegations of torture and 
hold perpetrators accountable to ensure the practice does not continue. 
I will see to it that individual cases of abuse are raised with senior 
Uzbekistani officials and will encourage the Government of Uzbekistan's 
cooperation with international human rights monitors and U.N. special 
rapporteurs. It is unacceptable for Uzbekistan, as a party to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment, and member of the U.N. Human Rights Council, 
to turn a blind eye to reports of torture.

    Question. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the U.N., including in elections 
for specialized bodies like the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who if 
elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. 
She is in a tough race that will require early, consistent engagement 
across capitals and within the U.N. member states.

   If confirmed, do you commit to demarching the Uzbekistan Government 
        and any other counterparts necessary to encourage their support 
        of Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will do all that I can to encourage 
Uzbekistan's support for Ms. Bogdan-Martin's candidacy.

    Question. If confirmed, how can you work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify, recruit, 
and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior Program 
Officer (JPO) program at the U.N.?

    Answer. The United States must play a leadership role at the United 
Nations and other international organizations. If confirmed, I will 
work with the Bureau of International Organization Affairs to support 
the recruitment and placement of qualified U.S. candidates in the 
U.N.'s Junior Professional Officers program.

    Question. The Uzbekistan has a low rate of voting coincidence with 
the U.S. in the U.N. General Assembly and in the Security Council.

   What is your assessment of this issue?

    Answer. Official Uzbekistani policy is to refrain from single-
country U.N. resolutions, as the country has bitter memories of being 
singled out for such resolutions during the Karimov era. Additionally, 
Uzbekistan carefully assesses its position at the U.N. with a view 
toward maintaining stable relations with strategic bilateral partners, 
including the PRC, Russia, and the United States. Accordingly, 
Uzbekistan frequently chooses to abstain from votes that put it in the 
middle of disagreements between the United States and Russia or China.

    Question. If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to 
engage with the Uzbeks on anticipated votes in the U.N. system that 
would increase their voting coincidence with the U.S.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will remind Uzbekistani diplomats of 
Uzbekistan's obligations under the U.N. Charter and the importance of 
maintaining an international order in which larger countries respect 
Uzbekistan's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. With 
this in mind, I will urge Uzbekistan to demonstrate solidarity with 
Ukraine at the U.N. and to promote accountability for the PRC's 
genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and members of 
other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.

    Question. Peace Corps was forced to leave Uzbekistan in 2005 after 
the Andijon Massacre. Since the change of leadership in 2016, I 
understand that Peace Corps has begun to move towards re-establishing 
its work in Uzbekistan.

   If confirmed as ambassador, do you commit to working towards the 
        return of Peace Corps to the Republic of Uzbekistan?

    Answer. I am thrilled at the prospect of the Peace Corps' possible 
return to Uzbekistan after more than 15 years. If confirmed, I will 
enthusiastically support the return of Peace Corps Volunteers to 
Uzbekistan.

    Question. If Peace Corps is able to return to Uzbekistan, in what 
sectors would you like to see volunteers be assigned to work? Where do 
you think they could be most useful, both to development in Uzbekistan, 
and to the U.S.-Uzbekistan relationship overall?

    Answer. The specific menu of Peace Corps programming in Uzbekistan, 
should the organization decide to return, will ultimately be guided by 
priorities mutually agreed upon by the U.S. and Uzbekistani 
Governments. I see tremendous potential demand for English language 
education in Uzbekistan and agree with the Uzbekistan Government's 
belief and as expressed in their invitation letter, Peace Corps 
Volunteers could make a significant and positive impact in supporting 
the Government of Uzbekistan's objective of expanding the number of 
fluent English speakers in Uzbekistan. Programming in this space would 
be mutually beneficial, to the extent that it would provide 
Uzbekistanis greater access to educational and business opportunities, 
as well as promoting a better understanding of Americans by 
Uzbekistanis and a better understating of Uzbekistanis by Americans, 
achieving the Peace Corps' second and third goals.

    Question. What is your stance on the continued application of the 
Jackson-Vanik amendment on Uzbekistan?

    Answer. The Department of State supports legislation that would 
authorize the U.S. President to determine that Jackson-Vanik should no 
longer apply to Uzbekistan.

    Question. What benefits would the repeal of this amendment and the 
establishment of normal trade relations have for Uzbekistan and the 
U.S.?

    Answer. First and foremost, the repeal of Jackson-Vanik for 
Uzbekistan would send a strong message to the Uzbekistanis that the 
United States no longer views Uzbekistan through the lens of the Soviet 
Union. Such a signal would strengthen Uzbekistani resolve to distance 
itself from Russia and its war of aggression in Ukraine. Similarly, 
Uzbekistan remains reliant on the PRC for trade and foreign direct 
investment, although it is interested in enhancing economic ties with 
the United States. We have signaled that we see expanded economic and 
trade ties as a long-term regional priority. Repeal of Jackson-Vanik, 
and the establishment of permanent normal trade relations, would 
provide a tangible sign that we are taking steps to back up our words 
with actions, and reciprocate Central Asian interest in diversifying 
trade relations in the region, pushing back on PRC efforts to establish 
itself as the region's dominant economic partner.

    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID.

   What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission Tashkent?

    Answer. Despite the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, morale is 
high at Embassy Tashkent. I have served in Uzbekistan previously and am 
closely familiar with the strains that the local operating environment 
place on U.S. personnel. If confirmed, I will have no higher priority 
than the health, security, and well-being of the Embassy community.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Tashkent?

    Answer. I would endeavor to sustain high morale by fostering an 
inclusive work environment at Embassy Tashkent, consistent with the 
Biden administration's vision of a State Department workforce culture 
that values collegiality, teamwork, and respect.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Tashkent?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will ensure clear lines of communications 
between my office, section management, and the broader Embassy 
community. I will set a strategic vision that underscores the common 
purpose of all Mission personnel. I will work closely with my deputy to 
ensure a workplace climate that values the contributions of our staff 
and encourages leadership and accountability at every level of the 
organization.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I provide vision and focus on communication and building 
trust. I demonstrate confidence in my teams and spend a lot of time 
keeping morale up and supporting staff development. I strive for a 
positive workplace culture so that my team stays motivated, even when 
the going gets tough. I welcome honest feedback and understand that the 
Mission looks to me for decisive leadership. Embassy life can be 
stressful for employees and their family members. I seek opportunities 
to recognize the sacrifices we make in support of our public service 
mission.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. It is never acceptable to berate any colleague in any 
situation. I address underperformance directly and strive to give 
subordinates the tools they need to succeed.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. I am extremely grateful to have a highly experienced DCM at 
my side in Tashkent. I will look to my DCM to provide frank advice, to 
play devil's advocate, and to keep a finger on the pulse of Embassy 
operations

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to trust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. I expect the DCM to devote special attention the goals in 
the Department of State's Strategic Plan for Diversity, Equity, 
Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA). I also expect my DCM to take 
seriously the traditional responsibilities of mentoring first and 
second tour officers and ensuring the strength of institutions that 
serve the Embassy community, most notably the Tashkent International 
School.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Constructive feedback is one of a manager's most important 
responsibilities to the subordinate, to the State Department, and to 
the American taxpayer. Employees cannot reasonably be expected to 
improve their performance absent constructive feedback. Failing to 
address performance issues does a disservice both to the employee and 
the institution.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I would champion clear, accurate, and 
direct feedback to employees and would celebrate excellent performance.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Uzbekistan.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our Embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. I fully agree that, as diplomats, we cannot fully succeed 
in our mission if we spend the majority of our time behind the walls of 
our Embassy. If confirmed, I will encourage my team to make every 
effort to build relationships with Uzbekistani interlocutors from all 
walks of life so that we can better understand the local context and, 
additionally, better craft our messages to local audiences. I will also 
encourage them to spend time visiting programs and grantees the Embassy 
supports and get to know alumni of our USG exchange programs.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. Regional travel is a regular component of Embassy Tashkent 
operations and, if confirmed, I will continue to support such trips. I 
will encourage Embassy Officers to make use of our network of American 
Corners, as a platform for engaging populations outside of Tashkent, as 
well as to visit our Embassy supported English Language programs and 
Democracy Commission grantees. I will also urge them to build 
relationships with alumni of our USG exchange programs, who reside 
across the country.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts.

   What is the public diplomacy environment like in Uzbekistan?

    Answer. Public diplomacy efforts in Uzbekistan are robust. In 
recent years we have seen a significant increase in applications to USG 
exchange programs, with total applications doubling, and in some cases 
tripling. English language programming continues to be an area of 
enthusiastic cooperation. Uzbekistan remains a welcoming environment 
for U.S. English teachers, and the network of American Corners and 
associated cultural programming continue to be exceedingly popular 
educational resources.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. While many of the Embassy's programs operate smoothly, 
bureaucratic hurdles and slow responses continue to present challenges 
to public diplomacy programming. Additionally, Russian disinformation 
is prevalent in Uzbekistan, and staff are forced to dedicate 
significant time to refuting and countering these false narratives.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. The Public Diplomacy Section has open communication with 
Main State on messaging guidance. Our diplomats overseas are experts on 
the local environment and are best placed to tailor messaging to 
Uzbekistani audiences.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will have no higher priority than the 
security and safety of the Mission community. I will do everything 
possible to ensure that employees who report a possible AHI receive 
immediate and appropriate attention and care and the incident is 
reported through appropriate channels.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Tashkent personnel?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will work to build a culture of trust, 
respect, and transparency at the Mission, and talk as openly as I can 
to our Mission community

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
             to Dr. Jonathan Henick by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. Uzbekistan is, by many measures, the most populous and 
economically significant country in Central Asia. As it has for much of 
its history, it sits at the crossroads of trade between Europe, Asia, 
and the Middle East. For the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) Belt and 
Road Initiative (BRI), Uzbekistan is critical in achieving the goal of 
binding the rest of Asia and Europe closer to China. In 2017, 
Uzbekistan's relatively reformist president Shavkat Mirziyoyev signed 
115 investment agreements worth more than $23 billion.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. As Secretary Blinken has noted, the ruling Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP) has become more repressive at home and more 
aggressive abroad, making the PRC the most serious long-term challenge 
to the international order. The PRC's manipulative economic practices 
have cost American workers jobs and robbed American companies of their 
intellectual property. Beijing's coercive tactics--from Lithuania to 
Taiwan--are deeply destabilizing and threaten U.S. interests across the 
globe.
    The United States will counter the threat posed by the CCP by 
standing by our allies and partners against PRC intimidation. We will 
boost the resilience of U.S. supply chains by reshoring production and 
diversifying suppliers in sensitive sectors of the economy. And we will 
continue to support the sovereignty, independence, and territorial 
integrity of our partners, including Uzbekistan.

    Question. Does Uzbekistan's increasing integration into BRI 
threaten the United States?

    Answer. While the PRC has indeed made significant investments in 
Uzbekistan, especially in infrastructure, Uzbekistan has adopted 
policies to limit its external debt and requires the majority of 
workers on foreign-financed projects to be Uzbekistani nationals. 
Moreover, Uzbekistan is keenly interested in enhancing economic ties 
with the United States. We have signaled publicly and privately that we 
see expanded economic and trade ties as a long-term regional priority. 
Reciprocating the Government of Uzbekistan's interest in diversifying 
its trade relationships will help support Uzbekistan and other Central 
Asian countries' ability to pursue relationships with a variety of 
partners of its own choosing, in line with its own national interests.

    Question. When President Mirziyoyev assumed power in 2016, many 
people assumed that he would be more reform-minded than his dictatorial 
predecessor, Islam Karimov, but still maintain Uzbekistan's neutral 
foreign policy. Do you see ties between Uzbekistan and the PRC 
improving during his tenure?

    Answer. Uzbekistani President Mirziyoyev's signature foreign 
policy, referred to as ``neighbors first'' or ``good neighbors,'' 
reversed the tense relations between Uzbekistan and its Central Asian 
neighbors that characterized the Karimov regime. President Mirziyoyev 
has paid state visits to every neighboring country except Afghanistan, 
and every Central Asian leader has made official visits to Tashkent. 
Under Mirziyoyev's watch, Uzbekistan has resolved many tough and long-
standing border and water resource-related disputes with its neighbors, 
particularly the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. The United States 
welcomes Uzbekistan's aspirations to serve as a champion of regional 
autonomy in Central Asia.
    Uzbekistan's relationship with the PRC spans political, economic, 
cultural, and security assistance. This includes a number of 
scholarship and internship opportunities for Uzbekistani students in 
the PRC and, more recently, an aggressive vaccine diplomacy campaign. 
While relations between Tashkent and Beijing are good under President 
Mirziyoyev, Uzbekistan continues to demonstrate considerable skill in 
managing a multi-vector foreign policy, including with the United 
States, that ensures it is not overly dependent on a single outside 
power.

    Question. What options are available to the United States to resist 
increasing CCP influence in Uzbekistan and Central Asia?

    Answer. As Secretary Blinken has said, our diplomacy is based on 
partnership and respect for each other's interests. We will continue to 
support the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of our 
partners, including Uzbekistan. In addition to U.S. bilateral support 
to Uzbekistan's reform agenda, the United States contributes to 
international development finance institutions, which are making major 
investments Uzbekistan's infrastructure needs.
    We know that many countries--including the United States--have 
vital economic or people-to-people ties with the PRC that they want to 
preserve. This is not about forcing countries to choose. It is about 
giving them a choice so that, for example, the only option is not an 
opaque investment that leaves countries in debt, stokes corruption, 
harms the environment, fails to create local jobs or growth, and 
compromises countries' sovereignty.
    The PRC is an important trading partner and continues to make 
investments in Uzbekistan, especially in infrastructure linked to 
President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). 
Nonetheless, Uzbekistan's Government makes subtle efforts to manage 
PRC-led investment and market dominance, as has occurred in neighboring 
countries.
    Uzbekistan's successful eradication of systemic forced labor in the 
cotton harvest--and the subsequent lifting of the boycott against Uzbek 
cotton--presents an opportunity for U.S. and European apparel companies 
to divest away from cotton sourced in Xinjiang. At a minimum, the Uzbek 
experience can serve as an example of how countries like the PRC can 
take steps to improve labor practices and open opportunities for trade 
and investment.

    Question. We've seen increased chaos in the region following 
President Biden's haphazard withdrawal from Afghanistan. Countries in 
the region, including Uzbekistan, will have to contend with the threat 
of Islamic terrorism for years to come. Uzbekistan, which had increased 
its security cooperation with us to counter the threat of terrorism, 
now likely does not see us as a reliable partner. Did President Biden's 
decision to force a haphazard and disorganized withdrawal from 
Afghanistan endanger American security? Why or why not?

    Answer. As President Biden has said, the United States will 
maintain the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan and in other 
countries. To that end, we will use our military capabilities and 
alliances, diplomatic tools, and unrivaled network of international 
intelligence and law enforcement partners. The United States has 
demonstrated that it does not require a protracted military footprint 
in Afghanistan to sustain these capabilities.

    Question. What is the current security threat posed by the Taliban 
and Islamic State-Khorasan to Uzbekistan?

    Answer. The Islamic State-Khorasan (ISIS-K) poses a security threat 
to Uzbekistan and other Central Asian countries bordering Afghanistan, 
as illustrated by recent cross-border attacks on Uzbekistan. ISIS-K 
claimed responsibility for an April rocket attack against an Uzbek 
military base in Termez, Uzbekistan from Balkh Province. Although the 
attacks caused little damage, ISIS-K media released videos of each 
attack, in an effort to boost the morale of the group's fighters and 
increase its appeal to potential Central Asian supporters.
    Uzbekistani Government sources reported a second rocket attack 
against Termez in July, that resulted in damage to property, but no 
casualties. Although no one has claimed responsibility for the July 
attack, the frequency of the incidents underscores the determination of 
violent extremists from Afghanistan to launch attacks on Uzbekistan. 
The Government of Uzbekistan maintains high-level ties with the Taliban 
and works with the Taliban to address the security threat to Uzbekistan 
from Afghanistan.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to support maintaining 
security ties between Uzbekistan and the United States?

    Answer. The Government of Uzbekistan remains interested in a broad-
based security partnership with the United States. Law enforcement is a 
particularly promising area of cooperation, as highlighted by the 
first-ever bilateral Law Enforcement Working Group meeting in April. 
Uzbekistan has also continued to increase cooperation with the United 
States on counterterrorism and border security, to include the non-
proliferation of nuclear materials.
    If confirmed, I will seek to expand our security cooperation with 
Uzbekistan, with particular attention to building a shared 
understanding of terrorist threat from Afghanistan. To that end, I will 
work to ensure we are closely cooperating on information sharing and 
handling of classified information. I will encourage Uzbekistan's 
continued close cooperation with the Mississippi National Guard through 
the State Partnership Program. I will also emphasize the importance of 
Uzbekistan diversifying away from Russian defense articles for its own 
sovereignty and to avoid the risks of U.S. actions under the Countering 
America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
             to Lesslie Viguerie by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has had somewhat 
diminished influence in Central Asia as it focuses its diplomatic 
efforts elsewhere. This has opened a window of opportunity for 
increased U.S. involvement in the Kyrgyz Republic.

   In what ways can the United States best take advantage of this 
        opportunity and lay a foundation for continued and permanent 
        progress in the U.S.-Kyrgyz relationship?

    Answer. The United States and Kyrgyz Republic share many goals and 
a mutual interest in working together to achieve them. The Kyrgyz 
Republic has stated its commitment to fighting corruption and organized 
crime. In this effort it will find no better partner than the United 
States. We hope to strengthen security cooperation to address 
challenges such as disaster preparedness and countering transnational 
threats. The United States is committed to supporting Kyrgyz economic 
resilience, connectivity, and diversification beyond its traditional 
partners, by developing the country's knowledge economy, in which a 
thriving IT sector drives job creation and connection to the global 
economy. Our countries share an interest in solving the climate crisis 
and can do much together to reduce emissions and build our ability to 
respond to the impacts of climate change. We have continuously stressed 
that we support the Kyrgyz Republic's sovereignty, independence, and 
territorial integrity and, if confirmed, I will continue to do so.

    Question. How will you work with Kyrgyz Government and private 
sector to increase economic ties with the United States?

    Answer. The United States is committed to supporting the new Kyrgyz 
economy with job creation and diversification of trading partners and 
increased exports, driven by a thriving IT sector, opportunities for 
increased access to credit such as venture capital, public-private 
partnerships, and connections to the international economy through the 
English language. The Kyrgyz IT sector in particular has tremendous 
potential, and the United States is a main market for Kyrgyz IT 
services. The United States is helping increase the performance of 
small and medium enterprises throughout the country, building their 
ability to become part of the international economy and absorb more 
direct foreign investment.
    The United States is committed to helping build the English skills 
of Kyrgyz children, university students, and professionals.

    Question. As Ambassador, how will you work to build people-to-
people ties between the U.S. and Kyrgyz citizens, particularly to 
counter Russian influence?

    Answer. People-to-people ties have developed considerably over the 
last 30 years and, if confirmed, I look forward to expanding them. 
Since 1993, we have supported the American University of Central Asia, 
where tens of thousands of the region's best and brightest have 
received U.S.-accredited degrees. Our American Center and seven 
American Corners throughout the country offer cultural programs, 
educational resources, and information on studying in the United States 
to tens of thousands of people per year. I also look forward, if 
confirmed, to working to expand ties between our private sectors to 
strengthen our economic ties.

    Question. Independent journalism that helps the public hold 
governments and corrupted elites accountable for their actions is under 
threat throughout Central Asia, and impacts the work of 
Congressionally-funded international media outlets such as RFE/RL. 
Throughout the region, governments do not consistently respond to 
requests for comments and interviews on questions of interest to RFE/
RL's audiences in the region, and local journalists working for RFE/RL 
are regularly targeted for retaliation for their journalistic work.
    In Kyrgyz Republic, while RFE/RL has an active bureau and generally 
good relations with the government that extends to RFE/RL requests to 
open new bureaus focused on migrant issues and coverage of developments 
in the Ferghana Valley, RFE/RL journalists have also been targeted 
threats, harassment, and smear campaigns for their impactful 
investigative reporting involving both government officials and corrupt 
elites, such as its award-winning expose of a large-scale, cross-border 
money-laundering network centered in the country.

   If you are confirmed as U.S. Ambassador, what will you do to 
        support the work of RFE/RL and ensure open access for 
        Congressionally-funded international journalists at your new 
        post?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will never hesitate to call out threats to 
freedom of the press, in accordance with the values we share with the 
Kyrgyz people and our support for human rights. We are proud of our 
longstanding support for the Kyrgyz press, including support for the 
work of RFE/RL, and I will commit to continuing to do so.

    Question. After two years, Kyrgyz authorities have failed to 
conclude an investigation into the death of human rights defender 
Azimjon Askarov, raising concerns over mistreatment and neglect in 
Kyrgyz prisons.

   If confirmed, how will you work with Kyrgyz officials to address 
        detainment center conditions and facilitate a conclusion to the 
        investigation into the death of Askarov?

    Answer. Mr. Askarov dedicated his life to the defense of human 
rights and reconciliation and understanding between all peoples. If 
confirmed, I will continue to emphasize to Kyrgyz authorities the 
importance of upholding human rights and accountability, including a 
thorough, fair investigation into the death of Mr. Askarov.

    Question. The 2022 State Department Report on Human Rights notes 
use of torture and harsh and life-threatening conditions in prison 
facilities as significant human rights issues. What steps would you 
take with the Kyrgyz Government to address these concerns?

    Answer. The United States is committed to supporting the Kyrgyz 
Republic's democratic system of government, rule of law, and the human 
rights and freedoms the Kyrgyz people have won since independence. If 
confirmed, I pledge to regularly advocate for the Kyrgyz Government to 
improve conditions in prison facilities and will offer the Embassy's 
assistance to achieve this goal.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Report on Human Rights, 
other significant issues involved restrictions of freedom of 
expression, violent threats to journalists over censorship, overly 
restrictive laws against NGO's or other civil society groups, and 
serious acts of government corruption. While the Government has taken 
steps to investigate and prosecute officials having committed human 
rights violations, official impunity has remained a problem.

   If confirmed, how will you work with Kyrgyz officials to reduce 
        governmental corruption and increase individual freedoms?

    Answer. President Japarov has publicly and repeatedly committed to 
combatting corruption, and we encourage his stated commitment, as anti-
corruption is a priority we wholeheartedly support, including through 
programming in partnership with Kyrgyz law enforcement bodies and 
relevant local community stakeholders. Through this engagement, we seek 
to ensure that Kyrgyz anti-corruption initiatives are both effective 
and observant of the rule of law.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons 
Report, Kyrgyz Republic remained Tier 2, largely through the 
Government's decreased investigations and prosecutions of trafficking 
cases, not securing any convictions of traffickers--including cases 
involving complicit officials.
    What is your assessment of this situation and if confirmed, what 
would you do to assist in the improvement of the legal system to 
convict traffickers, including complicit officials?

    Answer. Although there is more to be done, we are encouraged by the 
Kyrgyz Republic's upgrade in the 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report to 
Tier 2 after three years on the Tier 2 watchlist. If confirmed, I will 
offer the Embassy's full support for the Kyrgyz Republic's efforts to 
combat human trafficking, including assistance to initiate 
investigations into potential cases of official complicity, and develop 
and disseminate anti-trafficking training materials for police and 
prosecutors.

    Question. The report additionally indicates a heavy reliance on 
international organizations for victim identification, what steps would 
you take as Ambassador to improve the Kyrgyz Government's ability to 
independently identify trafficking victims?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will encourage and offer to help the Kyrgyz 
Republic to implement the prioritized recommendations as noted in the 
2022 TIP report. We will work with our Kyrgyz partners to increase 
their capacity to investigate, prosecute, and convict persons complicit 
in human trafficking, including government officials, while respecting 
due process. We will also offer cooperation to increase Kyrgyz efforts 
to proactively identify and protect victims.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 Report on International 
Religious Freedom, the report indicates that the Kyrgyz Government 
claims Jehovah Witness texts as `extremist,' that it has opened up a 
criminal case against them, and has conducted raids of the offices of 
Jehovah's Witnesses.

   If confirmed, what actions would you take to urge the Government to 
        respect religious freedom and peacefully conclude the criminal 
        allegations against Jehovah's Witnesses in the state?

    Answer. The Kyrgyz Republic has a proud tradition of religious 
tolerance. If confirmed, I will emphasize the importance of the Kyrgyz 
Government upholding religious freedom for all, including religious 
minorities like the Jehovah's Witnesses.

    Question. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the U.N., including in elections 
for specialized bodies like the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who if 
elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. 
She is in a tough race that will require early, consistent engagement 
across capitals and within the U.N. member states.

   If confirmed, do you commit to demarching the Kyrgyz Government and 
        any other counterparts necessary to encourage their support of 
        Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will do all that I can to encourage 
Kyrgyz support for Ms. Bogdan-Martin's candidacy.

    Question. If confirmed, how can you work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify, recruit, 
and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior Program 
Officer (JPO) program at the U.N.?

    Answer. believe a strong U.S. role at the United Nations and other 
international organizations is vital. If confirmed, I will work with 
the International Organizations Bureau to advance this objective 
however I can, including by identifying qualified U.S. candidates for 
the Junior Program Officer and other programs.

    Question. Kyrgyzstan has a low rate of voting coincidence with the 
U.S. in the U.N. General Assembly and in the Security Council.

   What is your assessment of this issue?

    Answer. The Kyrgyz Republic has longstanding ties with its regional 
partners. If confirmed, I will call on Kyrgyz leadership to uphold the 
U.N. Charter and condemn the Russian Federation's further invasion of 
Ukraine and gross violations of international law. I will also continue 
to encourage the Kyrgyz Government to promote accountability for the 
PRC Government's use of forced labor as well as its genocide and crimes 
against humanity against Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and 
religious minority groups in Xinjiang, including ethnic Kyrgyz.

    Question. If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to 
engage with the Kyrgyz Government on anticipated votes in the U.N. 
system that would increase their voting coincidence with the U.S.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will ensure Kyrgyz leaders that they will 
find no better and fairer partner than the United States to help them 
achieve their goals. I will note our support for Kyrgyz environmental 
initiatives at the United Nations and offer further support in 
addressing the climate crisis. I will also reiterate our belief that 
all countries have a vital interest in defending the principles and 
values that keep us all safe, including the principle that no country 
may seize the territory of a sovereign state and no country has a veto 
over another's security partners or political path.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you promote democratic and anti-
corruption reforms in Kyrgyz Republic, and in what areas of government 
is progress most viable?

    Answer. President Japarov has publicly and repeatedly committed to 
combatting corruption, and, if confirmed, I will offer full U.S. 
support in this campaign, including through Embassy programming in 
partnership with Kyrgyz law enforcement bodies and relevant local 
community stakeholders. Through this engagement, we will seek to ensure 
that Kyrgyz anti-corruption initiatives are both effective and 
observant of the rule of law.
    In 2021, we designated former customs official Raimbek Matraimov 
under Global Magnitsky sanctions and raised the Transnational Organized 
Crime Rewards Program amount on known drug trafficker Kamchybek Kolbaev 
to $5 million. In 2019, our law enforcement personnel cooperated to 
return $4.6 million stolen by the former President's son, Maksim 
Bakiyev, to the Kyrgyz people. These efforts demonstrate our commitment 
to working with Kyrgyz authorities to combat these criminal networks 
and their corrupt influence in Kyrgyz society.

    Question. Corruption at all levels continues to be a problem in 
Kyrgyz Republic. Do you think that the use of the State Department's 
7031(c) visa ban authorities could be a useful tool for fighting 
corruption in Kyrgyz Republic? Why or why not?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will support all actions to hold corrupt 
officials to account, including through 7031(c) visa bans. I believe 
measures like this are vital in order to show that we are backing up 
our words with actions.

    Question. What is your stance on the continued application of the 
Jackson-Vanik amendment on the Kyrgyz Republic?

    Answer. The Kyrgyz Republic is not subject to the Jackson-Vanik 
amendment.

    Question. What benefits would the repeal of this amendment and the 
establishment of normal trade relations have for the Kyrgyz Republic 
and the U.S.?

    Answer. The United States enjoys normal trade relations with the 
Kyrgyz Republic.

    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Bishkek?

    Answer. I understand morale is high at the Embassy, largely due to 
its outstanding leadership. I know from experience how important that 
is and will do my utmost to ensure it continues. If confirmed, the 
health, security, and well-being of the Embassy community will be my 
highest priority.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Bishkek?

    Answer. Over my 30 years in the Foreign Service, I have seen some 
of the best aspects of leadership, including the importance of building 
strong teams, valuing diversity, and mentoring the next generation of 
U.S. diplomats. These are the values that guide me. I will prioritize 
the safety and security of the Embassy community above all else and 
maintain a culture of respect and trust at the Embassy.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Bishkek?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will focus on inclusivity to ensure that 
all Mission personnel know that I value their views and expertise. I 
will seek to instill a culture of trust that recognizes the unique 
talents of our staff members and encourages them to take ownership of 
their work. As the chief of mission, I will share credit for our 
successes but accept the blame for our setbacks. I believe in the 
importance of ``one team'' and, if confirmed, will emphasize this value 
as Ambassador.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I always endeavor to build strong teams with high morale. 
Accomplishing this requires a commitment to inclusion, focus on 
professional development, and culture of trust and respect for all 
colleagues. As a leader, I convey to my team that all opinions and 
ideas are welcome. I see mentoring as an obligation so that staff not 
only thrive in their current assignments but are prepared to succeed in 
future positions as well. I seek to recognize others' accomplishments 
as often as possible and will assume responsibility when things go 
wrong. I also understand well that the Ambassador's responsibilities 
are not limited to within the Embassy's walls. Mission staff sacrifice 
much in this line of work and they expect--and deserve--leadership that 
cares as much about the personal as the professional side. To that end, 
I will always prioritize the well-being of the Embassy community above 
all else.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. Never. As a leader it is one's responsibility to put staff 
in a position to succeed and offer counseling and instruction when they 
do not. I believe in addressing poor performance promptly, but always 
in a respectful manner.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. Good leaders utilize the talent around them and I expect to 
have a close, collaborative relationship with my DCM. In Bishkek, I 
will be serving with a DCM who served as chief of mission for over a 
year. I expect we will divide responsibilities in a way that sees the 
DCM focus more on internal Embassy matters, but of course I will rely 
on their expertise and experience in all that I do.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I expect we will divide responsibilities in a 
way that sees the DCM focus more on internal Embassy matters, though of 
course I will rely on their expertise and experience in all that I do. 
Specifically, I will rely on the DCM to chair the Emergency Action 
Committee and further DEIA efforts at Post, especially with regards to 
recruitment of new officers.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking. Do 
you believe that it is important to provide employees with accurate, 
constructive feedback on their performances in order to encourage 
improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their roles?

    Answer. I believe providing constructive feedback and mentoring is 
one of the most important roles a leader can play. This should happen 
throughout the year--not just when EERs are due--to give the employee 
time and opportunity to learn and develop. If confirmed, I will 
emphasize the importance of developing our staff and providing timely 
feedback at all levels of the Mission.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes. I believe providing clear, accurate, and direct 
feedback is one of the most important roles a leader can play.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Kyrgyz Republic. In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our 
embassy walls enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. Staff at our Mission in Bishkek routinely leave the Embassy 
to meet with Kyrgyz Government, private sector, and civil society 
interlocutors. If confirmed, I will encourage this practice, as there 
is no substitute for face-to-face diplomacy. I will regularly review 
procedures with our Regional Security Office to ensure that our staff 
can do their jobs safely.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. Officers at Embassy Bishkek regularly travel throughout the 
country and, if confirmed, I will continue to support such trips as we 
cannot understand a country only from its capital. Our network of 
American Corners act as a vital bridge between the Embassy and local 
communities and I will encourage--and seek appropriate funding for--
regular Embassy visits to these centers. I will also advocate for more 
Kyrgyz-language training at the Foreign Service Institute given the 
increasing prominence of Kyrgyz across the breadth of society.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in the 
Kyrgyz Republic?

    Answer. Public diplomacy programming in the Kyrgyz Republic is 
among the most robust in Central Asia. Our Embassy disseminates 
messages--in English, Kyrgyz, and Russian--through a range of social 
media platforms that highlight our shared values and the breadth and 
impact of U.S. efforts, countering Russian disinformation. Our 
programming supports civil society that bolsters democratic 
development, economic development, good governance, inclusive education 
and opportunities, and tolerance.
    Additionally, our Mission hosts large-scale regional programs, 
including the Central Asia Design Hub and multiple programs at the 
American University of Central Asia. Our American Center and seven 
American Corners throughout the country offer cultural programs, 
educational resources, and information on studying in the United States 
to tens of thousands of people per year.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. Russian disinformation is ubiquitous in the Kyrgyz 
Republic, flooding the press and social media with anti-U.S. 
propaganda. Staff are forced to dedicate significant time to refuting 
and countering these lies. Our Embassy Public Diplomacy Section has 
done a great job of highlighting the positive role the United States 
plays in the Kyrgyz Republic and, if confirmed, I will offer them all 
the support I can in these efforts.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. Our diplomats overseas are experts on the local environment 
and are best placed to tailor messages to Kyrgyz audiences. Having 
served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Central Asia, I saw firsthand 
the excellent cooperation between Mission Bishkek's Public Diplomacy 
team and their counterparts here in Washington. If confirmed, I will 
seek to maintain that level of collaboration.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel. If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat 
seriously?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will have no higher priority than the 
security and safety of the Mission community. I will commit to taking 
all anomalous health incident reports seriously and to investigate them 
in a transparent manner.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Bishkek personnel?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will work to build a culture of trust, 
respect, and transparency at the Mission, and talk as openly as I can 
to our Mission community.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
               to Lesslie Viguerie by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), like all communist 
parties, views all capitalist systems as a threat to their existence. 
Anywhere people are allowed to decide for themselves how to live their 
lives, protect their families and achieve their dreams undermines the 
CCP's narrative that only it is the arbiter of truth. It should be no 
surprise that the CCP has worked to undermine Kyrgyzstan, once called 
the ``island of democracy'' in Central Asia. Current Kyrgyz President 
Sadyr Japarov, with the support of the CCP and Vladimir Putin, has 
overseen a political transition that has concentrated his power and 
gone after opposition leaders, journalists, and activists.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. As Secretary Blinken has noted, the ruling Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP) has become more repressive at home and more 
aggressive abroad, making the PRC the most serious long-term challenge 
to the international order. If confirmed, I will continue to support 
the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the Kyrgyz 
Republic as we have for the last 30 years

    Question. Does the increasing influence of the CCP in Kyrgyzstan 
threaten American interests?

    Answer. We are concerned about the fact that the Kyrgyz Republic 
has a large debt burden to China. In many areas, Beijing's leaders seek 
unfair advantages; behave aggressively, non-transparently, and 
coercively; and undermine the rules and values at the heart of an open 
and stable international system. We will continue to support the 
sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the Kyrgyz 
Republic, and seek to expand cooperation, including to support the 
country's economic growth and resilience.

    Question. Kyrgyzstan has been among the region's largest recipients 
of U.S. democracy assistance. How does the erosion of democracy there 
support CCP narratives that democracy is not a better model than its 
totalitarian system?

    Answer. The Kyrgyz people are proud of their democracy. If 
confirmed, I will continue to emphasize our commitment to supporting 
the Kyrgyz Republic's democratic system of government, rule of law, and 
the human rights and freedoms the Kyrgyz people have won since 
independence.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to support pro-democracy 
groups and sectors in Kyrgyzstani society?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will advocate for Kyrgyz civil society and 
speak out against erosion of democratic governance, corruption, and 
threats to freedom of speech and association, in accordance with the 
values we share with the Kyrgyz people. It is critical that Kyrgyz 
leadership safeguards the gains made over the last 30 years and upholds 
media freedom, elevates the role of civil society, protects the human 
rights of all its people, including members of all minority groups, and 
strengthens judicial independence.

    Question. The Chinese Communist Party is orchestrating nothing less 
than a genocide of Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang. We all know of the 
Uyghurs' plight, but this genocide has also ensnared ethnic Kyrgyz and 
Kazakhs. Despite this, the Kyrgyzstani Government has been remarkably 
silent about the systematic killings, detentions and abuse levied 
against ethnic Kyrgyz in Xinjiang. Even more shocking, there are 
indications that CCP efforts to convince the Kyrgyzstani Government to 
forcibly repatriate ethnic Kyrgyz back to Xinjiang are gaining ground. 
Earlier this year, Representative Chris Smith and I helped Ovalbek 
Turdakan, a Christian Kyrgyz resident of Xinjiang who had fled to 
Kyrgyzstan to escape the CCP, to seek asylum in the United States.

   Why do you think the Kyrgyzstani Government is unwilling to stand 
        up to the CCP and call out its genocide of ethnic Kyrgyz in 
        Xinjiang?

    Answer. We will continue to encourage the Kyrgyz Government to 
promote accountability for the PRC Government's use of forced labor, as 
well as its genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and 
members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, 
including ethnic Kyrgyz. We respect the Kyrgyz Republic's desire to 
have peaceful and constructive relations with all its neighbors, 
including the PRC, but believe all countries must join together in 
calling for an immediate end to the PRC's atrocities and for justice 
for the many victims. We will strongly advocate that the Kyrgyz 
Government respect its international obligations regarding non-
refoulment of refugees and asylum-seekers.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to using your position to 
assist and protect ethnic Kyrgyz who flee to Kyrgyzstan to escape the 
ongoing genocide in Xinjiang?

    Answer. Yes, I commit to assisting and protecting ethnic Kyrgyz who 
flee to the Kyrgyz Republic to escape the ongoing genocide in Xinjiang. 
I will also advocate for Kyrgyz leadership to promote accountability 
for the PRC's use of forced labor as well as its genocide and crimes 
against humanity against Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and 
religious minority groups--including ethnic Kyrgyz--in Xinjiang.

    Question. In 2010, Chinese security services used Shanghai 
Cooperation Organization Channels to solicit the Kyrgyz Government to 
interrupt a film festival in Kyrgyzstan that a Chinese Uyghur human 
rights activist was planning to attend. At Beijing's request, Kyrgyz 
authorities subsequently stopped the screening of a film made by the 
Uyghur activist. How can we best combat the long arm of Beijing in 
Kyrgyzstan?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continually emphasize that the Kyrgyz 
Republic will find no better partner to achieve its development 
objectives than the United States. We recently celebrated 30 years of 
bilateral relations, during which the United States has provided over 
$2 billion in assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic; by contrast, China has 
provided unfair, non-transparent loans. In addition to U.S. bilateral 
support to the Kyrgyz Republic's development goals, the United States 
contributes to international development finance institutions which are 
making major investments into the Kyrgyz Republic's infrastructure 
needs.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
         to Hon. Daniel N. Rosenblum by Senator James E. Risch

U.S.-Kazakhstan Relations
    Question.  Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has had a somewhat 
diminished influence in Central Asia, notably in Kazakhstan, as it 
focuses its diplomatic efforts elsewhere. This has opened a window of 
opportunity for increased U.S. involvement in the country.

   In what ways can the United States best take advantage of this 
        opportunity and lay the foundation for more permanent progress 
        in the U.S.-Kazakhstan relationship?

    Answer. Since Kazakhstan's independence in 1991, the United States 
has invested in building strong and broad-based ties with the 
Government and people of Kazakhstan, from educational and cultural 
exchanges to foreign trade and military-to-military cooperation. Today, 
Kazakhstan continues to seek U.S. engagement as part of its ``multi-
vector'' foreign policy, which aims to maintain positive relations with 
all global powers. Since the 1990s, U.S. companies have been some of 
the largest investors in Kazakhstan, and even more U.S. companies may 
choose to move regional offices to Kazakhstan following Russia's 
further invasion of Ukraine. In the security sector, there are new 
opportunities to help Kazakhstan diversify away from Russian training, 
doctrine, and equipment, in ways that meet Kazakhstan's fiscal 
constraints and defense priorities. If confirmed, I will continue and 
expand upon our work to strengthen bilateral people-to-people ties, 
level the playing field for U.S. companies wanting to do business in 
Kazakhstan and promote U.S. alternatives for Kazakhstan's security 
needs.

    Question.  Kazakhstan has publicly stated they will abide by 
western sanctions, but has not formally make a commitment to do so. 
Should the United States seek a formal sanctions commitment from 
Kazakhstan? Why or why not?

    Answer. The United States should not seek a formal sanctions 
commitment from Kazakhstan, as doing so could be counterproductive and, 
additionally, provoke Russia to apply even greater pressure against 
Kazakhstan not to abide by U.S. and partner-country sanctions. The 
Kazakhstani Government already is actively engaging with the United 
States to ensure not only that it supports U.S. sanctions, but that 
Russia does not use Kazakhstan to evade these sanctions. For example, 
the Kazakhstani Government has created a website to help local 
companies keep track of international sanctions against Russia and 
Belarus, and the Government has facilitated the exit from Kazakhstan's 
financial sector of sanctioned Russian's banks. If confirmed, I will 
work to ensure that Kazakhstan's Government and business community 
continue to abide by western sanctions and that Kazakhstan's economy is 
not used to evade these sanctions.

    Question.  How will you work with Kazakhstan's Government and 
private sector to increase economic ties with the United States?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue and expand upon outreach with 
Kazakhstan's businesses, both public and private, to encourage business 
opportunities for U.S. companies. There already are strong U.S.-
Kazakhstan business ties in the hydrocarbon sector, and at least one 
U.S. bank has had offices in Kazakhstan for over 20 years. Sectors like 
agriculture; renewable energy; and tourism all show great promise for 
U.S. business. The U.S. --Kazakhstan Business Council, the Department 
of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service, and the Department of 
Commerce's Foreign Commercial Service provide services to build 
business relationships and help U.S. exporters. If confirmed, I will 
also continue to support the Kazakhstani Government's efforts to 
improve the business and investment climate to ensure a level playing 
field for U.S. companies.

    Question.  As Ambassador, how will you work to build people-to-
people ties between the U.S. and Kazakhstan, particularly to counter 
Russian influence?

    Answer. Russian influence and disinformation remain extremely 
prevalent in Central Asia and in Kazakhstan. If confirmed, I will use 
all the tools of our robust Public Diplomacy Section to engage the 
Kazakhstani people. In-person engagements, social media, and 
participation in local festivals and holidays all play a role. Our 
Embassy also has significant journalist training and countering 
disinformation programs that we will continue to utilize and hope to 
expand. The Government of Kazakhstan has also expressed interest in 
continued and increased collaboration in academic and professional 
exchanges and higher education partnerships and if confirmed, I would 
work to find mutually beneficial areas to expand in this sphere.

Energy and Critical Minerals
    Question.  Kazakhstan is a significant producer and exporter of 
crude oil and natural gas and has a significant amount of uranium 
resources that can be used for nuclear fuel.

   Could Kazakhstan be a viable alternative to Russia for energy 
        exports to Europe?

    Answer. Kazakhstan accounts for about 2 percent of the global oil 
market, but 90 percent of exported oil currently uses pipelines which 
transit Russia and thus are vulnerable to Russian interference. More 
than 50 percent of these exports is destined for European markets. 
Kazakhstan is actively seeking alternative export routes, especially 
across the Caspian Sea. In the longer term these routes may allow 
Kazakhstan's oil to become a viable alternative for Europe to Russia's 
oil, but Kazakhstan's exports are very unlikely to replace Russia's 
exports to Europe entirely, especially in the short term.

    Question.  What challenges stand in the way of Kazakhstan 
increasing its energy exports to Europe?

    Answer. The biggest challenge is geography. Kazakhstan exports 80 
percent of its oil via the Caspian Pipeline Consortium which transits 
Russia and thus is vulnerable to Russian interference. Another 10 
percent goes through other Russian pipelines. The only other viable 
option to Europe is the trans-Caspian Sea route; issues there include a 
limited number of tankers to transport oil from Kazakhstan's ports to 
facilities in Azerbaijan and limits on available capacity. Kazakhstan's 
export options are further limited by the fact that the closest ports 
on the western Caspian are in Iran and Russia.

    Question.  How could the U.S. help solve challenges that stand in 
the way of Kazakhstan increasing its energy exports to Europe?

    Answer. The biggest short-term challenge is lack of shipping 
capacity in the Caspian Sea to transport oil from Kazakhstan's ports to 
Azerbaijan. Another option is moving oil by rail to other ports, such 
as in Georgia, although these routes would also transit Russia. On 
routes, the United States should use a scatter approach. Allowing 
Kazakhstan to deliver energy exports to multiple ports takes full 
advantage of available capacity. Longer term, encouraging cooperation 
on expanded trans-Caspian pipeline capacity is the best way to supply 
energy to Europe without involving Russia.

    Question.  Could Kazakhstan be a viable alternative to Russia for 
uranium exports?

    Answer. Kazakhstan is the world's largest exporter of natural 
uranium, which it exports in the form of yellow cake to other 
countries, including Russia, which then convert and enrich the uranium 
into a form that can be used to fabricate fuel for nuclear reactors. 
Currently Russia owns roughly 40 percent of the world's conversion and 
enrichment infrastructure. Kazakhstan has categorically stated it will 
not enrich uranium. Therefore, while Kazakhstan will continue to be a 
strong exporter of natural uranium, it cannot provide an alternative to 
Russia's converted and enriched uranium exports.

    Question.  How could the U.S. help Kazakhstan develop its capacity 
to export uranium?

    Answer. Kazakhstan is the world's largest exporter of natural 
uranium, which it exports in the form of yellow cake to other 
countries, including Russia, which then convert and enrich the uranium 
into a form that can be used to fabricate fuel for nuclear reactors. 
Kazakhstan has categorically stated it will not enrich uranium. This is 
a decision made in part due to the role Kazakhstan played as the site 
of the Soviet Union's nuclear testing program, which left a legacy of 
nuclear contamination, environmental degradation, and health problems 
for the people of Kazakhstan. If confirmed, I will work to continue the 
United States' cooperation with Kazakhstan to remediate its Soviet era 
nuclear legacy, strengthen our collaboration on nuclear 
nonproliferation, and explore cooperation and research on the peaceful 
use of nuclear energy, where U.S. technology can play an important 
role.

    Question.  Should the U.S. help Kazakhstan develop its capacity to 
export uranium?

    Answer. Kazakhstan is already a major global exporter of natural 
uranium, including to the United States. Although most of these exports 
go through Russia, since 2018 Kazakhstan has shipped a portion of its 
uranium by sea through the Caspian to Azerbaijan. Kazakhstan is also a 
potential source of valuable rare earth elements. It is in the 
strategic economic interests of the United States that Kazakhstan 
brings these commodities to the global market, so they are not 
monopolized by other countries such as the PRC. If confirmed, I will 
encourage Kazakhstan's Government to diversify the country's trade 
routes and reduce trade barriers.

    Question.  Could Kazakhstan be a viable alternative to Russia for 
critical minerals or other commodities?

    Answer. Kazakhstan is also a potential source of valuable rare 
earth elements. It is in the strategic economic interests of the United 
States that Kazakhstan brings these commodities to the global market, 
so they are not monopolized by other countries such as the PRC, and 
steps already are underway to improve Kazakhstan's ability to identify 
mineral resources. If confirmed, I will encourage Kazakhstan's 
Government to diversify the country's trade routes and reduce trade 
barriers.

    Question.  Kazakhstan is landlocked and relies on trade routes 
through neighboring countries to conduct international trade.

   What challenges does Kazakhstan face in exporting energy because of 
        this, and how can the U.S. help protect Kazakhstan's ability to 
        export oil and gas (and other goods) from political pressure by 
        its neighbors?

    Answer. The biggest challenge is geography. Kazakhstan exports 80 
percent of its oil--its largest product which accounts for nearly one 
quarter of its GDP--via the Caspian Pipeline Consortium which transits 
Russia and thus is vulnerable to Russian interference. The only other 
currently viable option to export oil to world markets is the trans-
Caspian Sea route. The United States should use a scatter approach 
here. Allowing Kazakhstan to deliver oil to multiple ports takes full 
advantage of available capacity. Longer term, encouraging cooperation 
on expanded trans-Caspian pipeline capacity is the best way to supply 
energy to Europe without involving Russia. For other goods, Kazakhstan 
mostly is a transit country for PRC goods heading to Europe rather than 
a major exporter itself.

    Question.  How can the U.S. help Kazakhstan lessen its reliance on 
the sale of its energy resources and diversify its economy?

    Answer. The United States supports Kazakhstani Government efforts 
to diversify its economy, including by improving the education of its 
citizens so they can better compete in the global, knowledge-based 
economy. Kazakhstan already has taken important steps, such as sending 
thousands of students overseas for to receive higher education, and 
beginning to implement the goal of tri-lingual (Kazakh, Russian and 
English) public education to make the workforce more competitive. 
Kazakhstan has great potential for renewable energy, especially wind 
and solar. The U.S. Agency for International Development has done 
significant work in this area, including helping the Government set up 
renewable energy auctions and strengthening regional electricity grids 
throughout Central Asia. The Embassy recently supported thousands of 
women entrepreneurs to expand their networks and utilize e-commerce. 
U.S. companies are also investing hundreds of millions of dollars to 
support health, education, and entrepreneurship in Kazakhstan. If 
confirmed, I would build on existing efforts to encourage Kazakhstan to 
train its workforce and diversify its economy with an eye to the 
future, and advocate for Kazakhstan to use U.S. educational 
institutions, businesses, and technologies to do so.

Press Freedom
    Question.  Independent journalism that helps the public hold 
governments and corrupted elites accountable for their actions is under 
threat throughout Central Asia, and impacts the work of 
Congressionally-funded international media outlets such as RFE/RL. 
Throughout the region, governments do not consistently respond to 
requests for comments and interviews on questions of interest to RFE/
RL's audiences in the region, and local journalists working for RFE/RL 
are regularly targeted for retaliation for their journalistic work.
    In Kazakhstan, RFE/RL journalists have been routinely harassed by 
security agents as they carry out their journalistic duties to cover 
major events such as the violent, nationwide protests of January 2022 
and other recent expressions of popular discontent, and government 
officials have often ignored RFE/RL requests for comment on issues of 
importance to our audiences in the country, including alleged high-
level corruption among Kazakhstan's ruling elites.

   If you are confirmed as U.S. Ambassador, what will you do to 
        support the work of RFE/RL and ensure open access for 
        Congressionally-funded international journalists at your new 
        post?

    Answer. Our Mission is in contact with RFE/RL on a regular basis 
and monitors the situation closely. Creating meaningful opportunities 
for media and civil society, including RFE/RL's Kazakh service, to 
provide independent commentary and input on pending laws and policies 
is a crucial component of the democratic process. If confirmed, I will 
encourage the Ministry of Information to uphold constitutional 
protections for freedom of the press, while urging the Government to be 
more transparent in its decision-making processes, budgetary matters, 
and other operations of public interest.

Peace Corps
    Question.  Peace Corps left Kazakhstan in 2011. Do you believe that 
Peace Corps should aim to return to the Republic of Kazakhstan? Why or 
why not?

    Answer. Peace Corps is a valuable program that expands U.S. 
outreach and in so doing pays long-term dividends. The Kazakhstani 
Government has expressed interest in partnering with the U.S. Mission 
to Kazakhstan to expand on many of the services that the Peace Corps 
used to provide in country, such as English teaching. Therefore, if 
confirmed, I will focus on expanding and seeking increased funding for 
the multiple academic and professional exchange programs offered by our 
Public Diplomacy section.

Corruption and Reform
    Question.  If confirmed, how will you promote democratic and 
corruption reforms in Kazakhstan?

    Answer. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced a raft of 
political, economic, and security reforms and condemned high-level 
corruption in Kazakhstan, following the serious unrest of last January, 
which began with peaceful protests that were rooted in socioeconomic 
concerns. If confirmed, I will urge Kazakhstan's leadership to make 
good on these promised reforms, which are ostensibly aimed at 
strengthening representative democracy and reducing corruption. To this 
end, I also will support development of relevant programming and 
assistance, funding permitting, to build on past bilateral cooperation 
related to rule of law and good governance.

    Question.  In what areas of government do you consider progress on 
democratic and corruption reforms to be most viable for Kazakhstan?

    Answer. Kazakhstan is a young, dynamic, and well-educated country. 
Government reform efforts to increase the political participation of 
women, youth, and persons with disabilities, and, separately, to 
strengthen rural self-government have the potential to transform 
Kazakhstan's political system and improve accountability on issues like 
public finance and corruption. If confirmed, I will work to expand the 
U.S. Government's contacts with reform-minded members of these groups 
in parliament, government, and Kazakhstan's rural areas and work to 
ensure they have the skills to succeed in building a more democratic, 
stable, and prosperous Kazakhstan.

    Question.  Corruption at all levels continues to be a problem in 
Kazakhstan. Do you think that the use of the State Department's 7031(c) 
visa ban authorities could be a useful tool for fighting corruption in 
Kazakhstan? Why or why not?

    Answer. I believe measures like 7031(c) visa restrictions are vital 
in order to show that we are backing up our words with actions. If 
confirmed, I will support all actions to hold corrupt officials to 
account, including through 7031(c) visa restrictions.


Jackson-Vanik
    Question.  What is your stance on the continued application of the 
Jackson-Vanik amendment on Kazakhstan?

    Answer. Jackson-Vanik is an economic tool originally designed by 
Congress to address restrictions on emigration. The conditions which 
made Jackson-Vanik necessary no longer exist in Kazakhstan. We have 
more effective tools to address [remaining] human rights concerns, as 
appropriate, including sanctions authorities and the Trafficking in 
Persons, and human rights and international religious freedom reports.
    Central Asia is looking very differently at Russia, and the United 
States should be looking differently at Central Asia. At this pivotal 
moment in history, we should be doing everything in our power to shore 
up these states as they rebuff Russia's constant pressure and 
entreaties to support its unprovoked war in Ukraine.
    Every step we take to bring these countries closer to the West will 
reduce Russia's ability to pressure them to support its war in Ukraine. 
We should grant Kazakhstan Permanent Normal Trade Relations not only to 
demonstrate our solidarity with the people of Kazakhstan, but also as a 
measure to weaken Russia's grip on the region. Although ultimately this 
is a decision for Congress, the Department of State supports graduating 
Kazakhstan from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.

    Question.  What benefits would the repeal of this amendment and the 
establishment of normal trade relations have for Kazakhstan and the 
U.S.?

    Answer. Lack of Permanent Normal Trade Relations due to Jackson-
Vanik remains an irritant in bilateral relations, one that is raised in 
nearly every encounter with Kazakhstani officials. Graduating 
Kazakhstan from the Jackson-Vanik amendment would send a strong signal 
that we view Kazakhstan as a reliable partner that has over 30 years of 
independence and has left behind its Soviet past, and eliminating the 
need for an annual waiver process would provide assurances of stability 
for investors.

Human Rights and International Organizations
    Question.  In the State Department's 2021 Human Rights Report, 
human rights advocates asserted that the domestic definition of torture 
does not meet the definition in the U.N. Convention against Torture, 
and there were reports of more than 200 incidents of torture throughout 
the year.

   If confirmed, how will you work with the Kazakh Government in 
        moving away from torture, including by meeting the definition's 
        international standard?

    Answer. If confirmed I will continue to use vehicles such as the 
Human Rights Report toengage Kazakhstan's leaders on the need to come 
into line fully with Kazakhstan's international obligations. I will 
also explore opportunities to strengthen cooperation on anti-torture 
training, investigations, and oversight within Kazakhstan's justice 
sector and security sector in light of President Tokayev and other 
Kazakhstani leaders openly acknowledging and condemning torture 
following the January events.

    Question.  What actions would you take to hold those officers 
committing human rights abuses of torture accountable?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will urge Kazakhstan's Government to pursue 
credible and transparent investigations into allegations of torture and 
other human rights violations and prosecute offenders where 
appropriate. Provided sufficient information is available, I will also 
support actions to hold these officials to account through mechanisms 
like visa restrictions under Section 7031(c) of the State 
appropriations act and financial sanctions under the Global Magnitsky 
sanctions program, as applicable.

    Question.  The report also indicates that prison facilities 
conditions are harsh and life-threatening, with prison authorities 
rarely conducting proper investigation into mistreatment, not 
publishing statistics such as deaths in detention facilities, and 
failing to adequately improve conditions to meet international health 
standards.

   If confirmed, how would you work with government authorities and 
        international organizations to increase the transparency of 
        prison facilities and improve conditions?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will review available cooperative 
assistance opportunities with the aim to increase transparency and 
improve conditions in prison facilities and strengthen cooperation on 
anti-torture training, investigations, and oversight within 
Kazakhstan's justice sector and security sector.

    Question.  What steps can you take, if confirmed, to bolster human 
rights in country and within civil society?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will make the protection of human rights 
and the strengthening of an independent, vibrant civil society one of 
my main priorities in Kazakhstan. I will regularly raise these issues 
in all my government and non-government meetings, as human rights are 
fundamental to a prosperous and stable society and will direct my staff 
to do the same. I will make use of all available tools, including the 
annual human rights report, international religious freedom report, 
trafficking in persons report, and child labor report, as well as 
bilateral assistance opportunities, to engage the Government and civil 
society on these issues.

    Question.  In the State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons 
Report, Kazakhstan remained on Tier 2, showing efforts to improve on 
meeting minimum requirements to eliminate trafficking. However, the 
Government is lacking in key areas such as identification of victims 
and traffickers, insufficient legislative efforts, and maintenance of 
obstacles for foreign victims to access protection services unless a 
criminal case had been initiated against the traffickers.

   If confirmed, how will you work with Kazakh officials to improve 
        their practices at identification of victims and traffickers?

    Answer. Identifying victims and gaining their support to assist 
with the investigation and prosecution of traffickers is key to 
effectively combating human trafficking in Kazakhstan. Identifying 
victims is a critical first step in ensuring their ability to receive 
the support and resources they need. If confirmed, I will ensure 
trafficking in persons programming at the Embassy continues to support 
training for law enforcement and other first responders, and government 
agencies whose work puts them in contact with possible trafficking 
victims. Recent changes in the law requiring that services be provided 
to foreign trafficking victims is a demonstration of Kazakhstan's 
willingness to improve its reputation on trafficking in persons.

    Question.  If confirmed, what steps could you take along with the 
host government to minimize the obstacles currently presented to 
victims of human trafficking?

    Answer. The annual Department of State Trafficking in Persons 
Report is an effective diplomatic tool to engage foreign governments on 
human trafficking, and serves as a reminder to the Government of 
Kazakhstan of its need to increase its efforts in combating human 
trafficking and protecting the victims. Recent amendments to 
Kazakhstani law that now instruct agencies to provide services to 
foreign trafficking victims demonstrate the Government's intent to make 
changes that support victims. Additionally, work on a standalone law on 
trafficking in persons, which is a recommendation in the annual report, 
has begun and is expected to be released for public comment this year. 
The law will codify roles and responsibilities of various government 
agencies for trafficking victims. If confirmed, I will capitalize on 
this momentum to press for more conformity to international standards.

    Question.  Kazakhstan is constitutionally a secular state, however 
in the 2021 International Religious Freedom report, many minority 
religious groups, particularly those cited as `non-traditional', faced 
arrest, detention, and imprisonment for their religious beliefs.

   What is your assessment of this issue and how would you assess the 
        effects of U.S. efforts to urge greater governmental and 
        societal respect for international religious freedom?

    Answer. Kazakhstan's constitution defines the country as a secular 
state and provides for freedom of religion and belief as well as the 
freedom to decline religious affiliation; however, according to local 
and international observers, authorities continued to impose 
restrictions on and conduct additional scrutiny of what the Government 
considered ``nontraditional'' religious groups. If confirmed, I will 
ensure embassy officials continue outreach to a wide range of religious 
communities, their leaders, and religious freedom advocates, and 
encourage reform of relevant laws and guidelines so all citizens can 
conduct peaceful religious activities freely.

    Question.  If confirmed, how would you build upon past USG efforts 
to promote further religious freedom?

    Answer. If confirmed, I and all my staff will continue to urge 
respect for religious freedom, both in general public outreach 
opportunities and regarding specific cases. I will advocate for more 
changes to the country's law regulating religious practice and raise 
the U.S. Government's concerns about Kazakhstan's current restrictive 
laws on religious freedom, especially those related to censorship of 
religious literature, as well those imposing criminal penalties for 
peaceful religious speech or praying without registration. If 
confirmed, I intend to meet with representatives of all faiths and will 
instruct my staff to do the same, to demonstrate how the United States 
respects and values religious freedom.

    Question.  The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the U.N., including in elections 
for specialized bodies like the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who if 
elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. 
She is in a tough race that will require early, consistent engagement 
across capitals and within the U.N. member states.

   If confirmed, do you commit to demarching the Kazakh Government and 
        any other counterparts necessary to encourage their support of 
        Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I commit to demarching all necessary 
parties to encourage support for Ms. Bogdan-Martin.

    Question.  If confirmed, how can you work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify, recruit, 
and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior Program 
Officer (JPO) program at the U.N.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will regularly discuss the importance of 
qualified, independent personnel at the U.N. with Kazakhstani 
Government counterparts and instruct my staff to do the same. I will 
engage on behalf of American candidates consistently and to the best of 
my abilities work with the International Organizations (IO) bureau and 
other stakeholders to identify, recruit, and install qualified 
Americans in U.N. specialized bodies.

    Question.  Kazakhstan has one of the lowest rates of voting 
coincidence with the U.S. in the U.N. General Assembly and in the 
Security Council.

   What is your assessment of this issue?

    Answer. Kazakhstan has pursued since its independence in 1991 a 
``multi-vector'' foreign policy, which aims to maintain positive 
relations with all global powers, taking into account its geographic 
location and borders with both Russia and the PRC. If confirmed, I will 
engage the Kazakhstani Government early and regularly on votes in the 
U.N. system and ensure my staff does the same, to encourage voting with 
the United States and on behalf of the rules-based international order, 
on issues presented in the U.N. General Assembly.

    Question.  If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to 
engage with the Kazakhs on anticipated votes in the U.N. system that 
would increase their voting coincidence with the U.S.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will engage the Kazakhstani Government 
early and regularly on votes in the U.N. system and ensure my staff 
does the same, to encourage voting with the United States on issues 
presented in the U.N. General Assembly.

State Department Manangement and Public Diplomacy
    Question.  Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID.

   What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission Nur-Sultan?

    Answer. Morale at Embassy Nur-Sultan and Consulate General Almaty 
remains strong. I was heartened to hear about the Mission community's 
resilience as they recovered from the double hit of unrest in Almaty 
and the Omicron wave in January this year. I credit the strong 
leadership of our current Charge d'Affaires as well as the 
professionalism and sense of purpose that is shared across both the 
American and local staff. If confirmed, I will work to ensure morale 
remains high, by fostering an inclusive workplace, recognizing and 
rewarding employee excellence, making sure people have the tools, and 
training (and vaccines) to do their jobs, and prioritizing work-life 
balance.

    Question.  How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Sur-
Sultan?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work to maintain good morale at 
Mission Kazakhstan by modeling and creating a workplace environment 
that values respect, empathy, integrity, teamwork, and work-life 
balance. I also believe it is essential to recognize and reward 
employee excellence, and to make sure people have the tools, and 
training (and vaccines) to do their jobs.

    Question.  How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Nur-Sultan?

    Answer. I believe fervently in the concept of ``one team, one 
mission'' and have tried to apply it throughout my State Department 
career, including in a number of U.S. Government interagency settings. 
If confirmed, I will try to instill this approach at Mission Kazakhstan 
by facilitating an open and collaborative interagency coordination 
process, and by asking the country team to organize its work around the 
goals and objectives of our Integrated Country Strategy (ICS). I have 
found the best way to get ``buy-in'' to this approach is to model and 
encourage an inclusive and transparent leadership style, to deemphasize 
the differences among various agencies, and to stress what we share in 
common as a single country team with a single mission.

    Question.  Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of 
Mission. How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I would describe my management style as focused on 
empowering my team to do their jobs well. I try to achieve this by: 1. 
Setting clear goals and priorities; 2. Communicating early, often and 
transparently; 3. Being a good listener; 4. Being empathetic and 
emotionally intelligent; 5. Showing that I value good work and hard 
effort; and 6. Prioritizing work-life balance by encouraging attention 
to family and activities outside of the workplace. I try to avoid 
micromanaging those to whom I have delegated responsibility or picking 
favorites among the different elements of the team--everyone's 
contribution is essential to success.

    Question.  Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No, this is not acceptable behavior. If confirmed, I pledge 
to treat staff at all levels with the respect they deserve. My approach 
is: ``Praise publicly; when necessary, provide constructive criticism 
promptly but privately.''

    Question.  How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. I plan to have a close, collaborative relationship with my 
DCM. I am fortunate to have a DCM who will have served as Charge 
D'Affaires for over a year prior to my arrival, and who therefore is 
familiar with all Embassy operations. I see her as the Mission's Chief 
Operating Officer, and as my ``alter ego,'' capable of stepping in to 
assume Mission leadership when necessary.

    Question.  If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. I see her as the Mission's Chief Operating Officer and 
expect she will focus somewhat more on internal Embassy matters and 
somewhat less on external outreach than I. But I will rely on her 
advice and counsel in all matters. I expect she will take on key 
leadership responsibilities within the Mission, including all post-
level mentoring programs for entry-level and mid-level officers and 
local staff, and chair of the Emergency Action Committee. I would also 
expect that the DCM would share with me, if I am confirmed, leadership 
on matters related to the promotion of a diverse and inclusive 
workforce that fosters respect, productivity, and professional 
engagement across all sections and agencies. And I also see her as a 
force multiplier for both our government-to-government and public 
diplomacy efforts. By fully utilizing the DCM's skills and experience--
which have been proven during her past year serving as Charge 
d'Affaires--we will better achieve our agenda vis-a-vis the Government 
of Kazakhstan and reach a broader range of the Kazakhstani public with 
our messaging and outreach.

    Question.  In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe it is important to provide employees with accurate, 
        constructive feedback on their performances in order to 
        encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Yes. Accurate and timely feedback is important throughout 
the year, not just when evaluations are due. Productive development of 
staff is a continuous process and, if confirmed, I will emphasize the 
importance of this.

    Question.  If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I pledge to encourage direct, accurate 
feedback to improve performance and reward high achievers. This is one 
of a leader's most important tasks.

    Question.  It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of 
posts abroad to meet with local actors, including host government 
officials, non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats 
stationed in Kazakhstan.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. Mission Kazakhstan staff regularly leave the office to 
engage with host government officials, other diplomats, and private 
persons. Face-to-face contact is vital for diplomacy. If confirmed, I 
will continue this practice and will consult regularly with our 
security personnel about whether it remains safe for staff to do so.

    Question.  How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. Officers at Mission Kazakhstan--both the Embassy in Nur-
Sultan and the Consulate in Almaty--regularly travel within the country 
and, if confirmed, I will strongly encourage such trips. We cannot 
understand a country only from its capital and large cities. Our 
network of American Corners act as a vital bridge between the Embassy 
and local communities and I will encourage--and support appropriate 
funding for--regular Embassy visits to these centers.

    Question.  Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts.

   What is the public diplomacy environment like in Kazakhstan?

    Answer. Interest in U.S. culture, learning English, studying in, or 
traveling to the United States, and forming connections with U.S. 
businesses remains high. While technically free, the media environment 
in Kazakhstan is characterized by a lack of a professional journalist 
corps, a high degree of self-censorship, and periodic government 
blocking of websites allegedly propagating extremism or anti-government 
criticism. Russian-language media continues to be extremely influential 
in shaping Kazakhstanis' understanding of the world. If confirmed, I 
commit to ensuring our PD programs continue to counter disinformation 
through engaging journalists, encouraging English language learning and 
media literacy; engaging civil society to support human rights and 
democratic processes; and promoting the importance of inclusive, 
diversified economic growth.

    Question.  What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. While there is much interest in and many opportunities for 
collaboration, some U.S. policy priorities are still considered 
sensitive and controversial in Kazakhstan, especially outside large 
cities. There is also a vocal online group which claims some of the 
programs run by the U.S. Embassy in Kazakhstan are antithetical to 
traditional Kazakh values. If confirmed, I will support our Public 
Diplomacy Section's efforts to address these challenges and raise 
concerns with appropriate government authorities.

    Question.  How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. Mission Kazakhstan maintains effective lines of 
communication with relevant offices at Main State to craft appropriate 
messaging and alleviate any discrepancies. If confirmed, I will make 
sure these lines of communication remain open.

    Question.  ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will have no higher priority than the 
security and safety of the Mission community. I have already had to 
deal with several AHIs over the past three years in Tashkent. If 
confirmed, I will do everything possible at Mission Kazakhstan to 
ensure that employees who report a possible AHI receive immediate and 
appropriate attention and care and the incident is reported through 
appropriate channels.

    Question.  If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Nur-Sultan personnel?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I will be as open as possible with 
Mission Kazakhstan personnel to build a culture of trust and respect, 
as I have done at Mission Uzbekistan over the past three years.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
           to Hon. Daniel N. Rosenblum by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is orchestrating 
nothing less than a genocide of Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang. We all know 
of the Uyghurs plight, but this genocide has also ensnared ethnic 
Kyrgyz and Kazakhs. In Kazakhstan, we have seen signs that the Kazakh 
state has served as an extension of the CCP's transnational system of 
surveillance and repression. Ethnic Kazakhs who flee Xinjiang are 
denied permission to enter the country, civil society groups raising 
awareness of the genocide find their profiles on social media and 
YouTube blocked and removed. Several individuals may have even been 
forcibly repatriated to Xinjiang.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. As Secretary Blinken has noted, the ruling Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP) is the most serious long-term challenge to the 
international order. Beijing's coercive tactics--from Lithuania to 
Taiwan--are deeply destabilizing and threaten U.S. interests across the 
globe. PRC authorities have committed genocide and crimes against 
humanity against Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious 
minority groups in Xinjiang. Secretary Blinken has made clear that the 
United States stands with countries and people around the world in 
condemning the atrocities happening in Xinjiang, and if confirmed, I 
will advocate that Kazakhstan promote accountability for the PRC's 
atrocities against Uyghurs and members of other religious and ethnic 
minority groups--including ethnic Kazakhs--in Xinjiang.

    Question. Is the CCP's increasing control over the Kazakh state 
threatening ethnic Kazakhs?

    Answer. With an 1,100-mile shared border and deep historical, 
political, and economic links, Kazakhstan approaches its relationship 
with the PRC with great caution. If confirmed, I will work to support 
Kazakhstan's freedom to pursue a multi-vector foreign policy within 
which it can advance its national interests through cooperation with a 
variety of partners. That national interest includes promoting and 
protecting Kazakhstan's unique cultural identity, and the rights of 
members of all Kazakhstan's ethnic groups, including ethnic Kazakhs. If 
confirmed, I will also advocate that Kazakhstan's Government continue 
to uphold its international obligations regarding non-refoulement of 
refugees, and that it allows victims of PRC atrocities, their 
relatives, and NGOs advocating on their behalf to speak and organize 
freely.

    Question. Is Kazakhstan a possible template for how the CCP will go 
after its opponents who have fled overseas to other countries?

    Answer. Kazakhstan offers benefits, including a simplified pathway 
to citizenship, for ethnic Kazakhs from abroad, including individuals 
from the PRC. As a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, 1967 Refugee 
Protocol, and 1984 Convention Against Torture, Kazakhstan has an 
obligation to refrain from forcibly returning noncitizens to a country 
where they would be persecuted or tortured, and thus far has granted 
temporary refugee status to four individuals fleeing the PRC. If 
confirmed as Ambassador, I will continue to work with Kazakhstan and 
international organizations like the U.N. to ensure the safety of 
refugees, including those from Xinjiang, and encourage full compliance 
with the terms of the 1951 Refugee Convention, 1967 Refugee Protocol, 
and 1984 Convention Against Torture.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you press the Kazakh Government to 
recognize the genocide of ethnic Kazakhs in Xinjiang?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue to advocate that Kazakhstan 
publicly condemn the PRC's atrocities against Uyghurs and members of 
other religious and ethnic minority groups--including ethnic Kazakhs--
in Xinjiang. I will also advocate on behalf of freedom of expression 
and peaceful assembly, including for Xinjiang advocates, and for full 
protection of refugees, including those from Xinjiang, consistent with 
the 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 Refugee Protocol.

    Question. Earlier this year, Kazakhstan experienced the most 
significant anti-government protests in its history. It's clear from 
independent media that these initially peaceful protests expressed 
frustration with increasing prices, a stagnant economy, and rampant 
government corruption. The Government's crackdown on these protests, 
supported by Russian special forces, was so violent that many Kazakhs 
call the protests ``bloody January.''

   Are you aware of U.S. efforts to hold Kazakh officials accountable 
        for human rights abuses against peaceful protesters in 
        Kazakhstan? If so, please describe.

    Answer. Violent organized groups co-opted initially peaceful 
January protests and fomented violence on the streets of multiple 
Kazakhstani cities in an effort to weaken President Kassym-Jomart 
Tokayev or remove him from power. Violent rioters attacked and burned 
government buildings, looted commercial buildings, and killed 19 
members of Kazakhstan's security forces. In the face of the sudden 
violence and political uncertainty, President Tokayev called on the 
Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) to provide perimeter 
security around critical infrastructure and thereby help restore order.
    During the Government's response to the violence there were 
credible reports of abuse and excessive use of force by security 
forces, including credible allegations of torture and deaths of 
individuals in detention. More than six months after these events, the 
Government continues to investigate these credible allegations of 
abuses of power, killings, and torture. Nine members of security forces 
have been detained and another 15 have been identified as suspects and 
are reportedly under investigation. The Government has also detained 
senior members of the security forces on charges of treason and abuse 
of power for allegedly organizing or allowing the violence.
    The United States is actively working with civil society to 
encourage the Government of Kazakhstan to ensure that these 
investigations are credible and independent, and that victims and their 
families receive the accountability and justice they deserve. If 
confirmed, I will continue to press the Government of Kazakhstan to 
hold its security forces accountable for their actions in January and 
will ensure that my embassy team does the same.

    Question. What is your assessment of claims made by the Kazakh 
opposition that agents of the Kazakh Government embedded themselves in 
protests to spark violence and thereby justify a violent crackdown?

    Answer. The State Department's current understanding of the events 
is that violent organized groups co-opted initially peaceful January 
protests and fomented violence on the streets of multiple Kazakhstani 
cities in an effort to weaken President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev or remove 
him from power. Violent rioters attacked and burned government 
buildings, looted commercial buildings, and killed 19 members of 
Kazakhstan's security forces. In the face of the sudden violence and 
political uncertainty, President Tokayev called on the Collective 
Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) to provide perimeter security 
around critical infrastructure and thereby help restore order.
    During the Government's response to the violence there were 
credible reports of abuse and excessive use of force by security 
forces, including credible allegations of torture and deaths of

have been detained and another 15 have been identified as suspects and 
are reportedly under investigation. The Government has also detained 
senior members of the security forces on charges of treason and abuse 
of power for allegedly organizing or allowing the violence.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to support democracy 
activists and civil society in Kazakhstan?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue efforts to encourage and 
strengthen civil society and citizens' participation in Kazakhstan's 
governance and political process. I will explore ways to further build 
capacity and skills for more inclusive participation in all levels of 
Kazakhstani Government. I will also advocate on behalf of freedom of 
expression, peaceful assembly, and association, so that all those who 
so choose can peacefully express their political views and contribute 
to Kazakhstan's future.

               to Joey R. Hood by Senator Robert Menendez

Economic Concerns
    Question. As you know, Tunisian authorities have been in 
consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding a $4 
billion loan to address Tunisia's economic concerns. The sharp rises in 
grain and energy prices caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine are 
exacerbating inflation and widening the Government's budget deficit, 
leading to delays in state salaries and difficulties in paying for 
wheat imports.

   How can the U.S. work with other donor nations to encourage a 
        return to a transparent and inclusive system of democratic 
        governance?

    Answer. In tandem with our G7 and other international partners, if 
confirmed, I would continue to publicly and privately advocate for 
implementation of measures to return to democratic governance. I would 
also coordinate with international partners to align assistance 
programs to ensure they are encouraging a return to democratic 
governance and supporting economic stability through robust assistance 
to civil society, relief to citizens, and bolstering the private 
sector.

Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC)
    Question. Following President Saied's dismissal of parliament, the 
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) suspended its nearly $500 
million compact with the Tunisian Government. This compact includes 
projects to strengthen Tunisia's transportation, trade, and water 
sectors.

   Given that the signing of a compact hinges on Tunisia having a 
        democratically elected parliament, what is the current outlook 
        for the compact?

    Answer. Although the compact is ready for signing and 
implementation, MCC eligibility criteria requires partner countries to 
demonstrate a commitment to democratic governance. If confirmed, I 
would seek every opportunity to engage with Tunisia's leaders, civil 
society, media, political parties, unions, and other stakeholders 
advocate for the re-establishment of a democratic government 
accountable to their people. Until that occurs, the compact is unable 
to move forward.

    Question. How, if it all, should American security engagement with 
Tunisia change if Saied continues to consolidate power? Do you believe 
that threatening to curtail or suspend U.S. aid and security assistance 
to Tunisia would effectively pressure Saied to change course?

    Answer. The Tunisian military remains an apolitical and 
professional force that reports to civilian leadership. Tunisia 
continues to face a threat from ISIS and other U.S.-designated 
terrorist organizations as well as from instability in the region, 
especially in neighboring Libya. U.S. security assistance is critical 
in supporting Tunisian-led efforts to secure its borders, counter 
terrorism, and provide a safe and stable environment in the region.

Anomalous Health Incidents
    Question. I am very concerned about directed energy attacks on U.S. 
Government personnel (so-called Anomalous Health Incidents). Ensuring 
the safety and security of our personnel abroad falls largely on 
individual Chiefs of Mission and the response of officers at post. It 
is imperative that any individual who reports a suspected incident be 
responded to promptly, equitably, and compassionately.

   Do you agree these incidents must be taken seriously, and pose a 
        threat to the health of U.S. personnel?

    Answer. Yes, I fully agree this must be taken seriously.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to ensuring that any reported 
incident is treated seriously and reported quickly through the 
appropriate channels, and that any affected individuals receive prompt 
access to medical care?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will be committed to the safety and well-
being of Mission personnel and to working in close partnership with the 
President's AHI Interagency Coordinator, the Department's Health 
Incident Response Task Force, and the broader government-wide effort to 
ensure the full resources of the U.S. Government are brought to bear to 
get to the bottom of these incidents and to ensure access to needed 
care for those affected.

    Question. Do you commit to meeting with medical staff and the RSO 
at post to discuss any past reported incidents and ensure that all 
protocols are being followed?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I would be committed to providing 
Mission Tunisia personnel with the most up-to-date information 
available, as we learn more, including guidance on how to respond if 
they have concerns that they might have experienced an incident and how 
to access medical care.

Policy Priorities
    Question.  Please outline U.S. national security interests and your 
policy priorities as the United States Ambassador to Tunisia.

    Answer. If confirmed, my most important priority as ambassador 
would be the safety and security of Americans living in and visiting 
Tunisia. My next priority would be to help put Tunisia on a more stable 
and prosperous trajectory through inclusive and open economic growth. 
The country must enact necessary economic reforms that foster inclusive 
growth. Tunisia should return to a democratic system of checks and 
balances, with an effective and accountable government that protects 
human rights and fundamental freedoms. I would continue engagement with 
Tunisia's leaders, civil society, media, political parties, unions, and 
other stakeholders to re-establish a democratic government accountable 
to its people. Tunisia will continue to face persistent security 
threats caused by regional instability, the return of Tunisians from 
foreign conflict zones, and domestic terrorism. We will advocate for 
prioritization of Tunisian security forces' partnerships with the 
United States and avoidance of partnerships that undermine Tunisia's 
sovereignty and regional stability. Counterterrorism and military 
support will seek to focus continued Tunisian attention to the 
dismantling of domestic violent extremist organizations, securing 
Tunisia's land and sea borders, and participating in regional and U.N. 
security missions.

Democratic Backsliding
    Question. Initially a Democratic success story after the Arab 
Spring and Jasmine Revolutions, Tunisia's President Kais Saied is 
unilaterally dismantling Tunisia's democratic institutions. Further, 
Saied has been seemingly immune to international pressure to change 
course.

   Please outline your strategy for creating leverage with President 
        Saied and the prospects for halting Tunisia's democratic 
        backsliding and restoring the balance of power and rule of law.

    Answer. An independent and strong civil society is integral to an 
effective democracy, helping promote accountability, human rights, and 
fundamental freedoms. If confirmed, I would continue to support 
Tunisia's vibrant civil society while reiterating the need for the 
Government of Tunisia to respect human rights, including freedom of 
expression and association. U.S. support to civil society has been and 
will continue to be a critical component of our assistance to Tunisia. 
I would seek every opportunity to also urge the Government to see civil 
society as a partner in advancing democratic principles, public health, 
education, and human rights. With legislative elections scheduled in 
December, this is a crucial moment for the Government to demonstrate 
inclusivity and transparency in the new electoral law, taking into 
consideration the perspectives of civil society and political parties, 
which will be essential for the legitimacy and representativeness of 
the future Parliament.

    Question.  What are your takeaways from Tunisia's constitutional 
referendum and the resulting constitution?

    Answer. I acknowledge Tunisians' overwhelming concerns about 
corruption, economic mismanagement, and the ineffectiveness of past 
governments. I also note the concerns of many Tunisians regarding the 
lack of an inclusive and transparent process for the drafting of the 
new constitution, and concerns over the constitution's weakened checks 
that could threaten their democracy and human rights. If confirmed, I 
will encourage Tunisia's leaders to develop an effective, democratic 
government that protects human rights, freedom of expression and 
association, rule of law, and judicial independence, and promotes long-
term economic prosperity based on a system of checks and balances, a 
critical component for the health of all democracies.

    Question.  Is U.S. assistance an effective lever to influence 
Saied's conduct?

    Answer. We continuously review our assistance programs to ensure 
they align with our policy goals and values. Reductions in the 
Administration's FY 23/FY 23 budget request, in comparison to prior 
year requests, reflect our significant concerns over democratic 
backsliding. U.S. assistance that addresses the pressing needs facing 
the Tunisian people will continue, including our support for civil 
society and efforts to promote inclusive and sustainable economic 
growth.

    Question.  Would a unified message and coordinated assistance 
reductions tied to democratic benchmarks across the G7 better influence 
Tunisia's trajectory?

    Answer. Our work with partners including unified messaging from the 
G7 has been an important element in of our efforts to set democratic 
benchmarks that Tunisia should meet to preserve democratic 
institutions. In tandem with international partners, I would, if 
confirmed, continue publicly and privately to advocate for a swift 
return to democratic governance. I would also coordinate with 
international partners to align assistance programs to ensure they are 
encouraging a return to democratic governance and supporting economic 
stability through robust assistance to civil society, relief to 
citizens, and bolstering the private sector.

Mil-to-Mil Relationship
    Question. Elsewhere in North Africa, select members of Congress 
have sought to curtail the U.S.-Morocco mil-to-mil relationship over 
Western Sahara concerns--even as far as to reject Moroccan 
participation in AFRICOM's capstone exercise African Lion.

   Should the United States consider revoking Tunisian participation 
        in African Lion as a consequence of democratic backsliding? Why 
        or why not?

    Answer. The Tunisian military remains an apolitical and 
professional force that reports to civilian leadership. Tunisia 
continues to face a threat from ISIS and other U.S.-designated 
terrorist organizations as well as from instability in the region, 
especially in neighboring Libya. Military trainings and exercises, 
including African Lion, are critical in supporting Tunisian-led efforts 
to secure its borders, counter terrorism, provide safety and foster 
stability in the region.

Economy
    Question. According to the World Bank, the Tunisian economy has 
grown on average by a meager 1 percent annually. The Tunisian 
Government has tried to maintain social peace through extensive 
subsidies and expanding Tunisia's civil service--now among the largest 
in the world.

   What are the most effective tools to spur Tunisia's economic 
        recovery?

    Answer. The Government is negotiating a potential agreement with 
the IMF, and this could help support reforms that would benefit all 
Tunisians. One key aspect of the proposed reforms involves the 
development of the private sector, which would expand investment 
potential, reduce the influence of monopolies, and support local 
entrepreneurship. If confirmed, I would promote a vision of inclusive, 
open economic growth and stronger ties with U.S. companies.

    Question.  Are Kais Saied's ``anti-corruption'' reforms effectively 
addressing Tunisia's economic woes? How would you advise him to change 
course?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would work with our G7 partners to 
reinforce the message that many of Tunisia's corruption challenges can 
be addressed through an economic reform agenda. By reducing the 
nation's dependence on subsidies, supporting the private sector, and 
better managing government spending, including on public wages and 
state-owned enterprises, the President has the best chance of 
stabilizing his nation's economy while addressing corruption.

    Question.  How do you strike the balance between Tunisia's 
austerity measures (subsidies, expansion of civil service etc.) and 
necessary IMF reforms?

    Answer. A potential IMF program would be designed to support and 
enable core reforms that Tunisia needs to undertake urgently. These are 
reforms outlined in the Government's own economic reform agenda. 
Stakeholders, including the Government of Tunisia, the IMF, 
international donors, trade unions, and private sector representatives, 
broadly share an understanding of the reforms needed to address the 
economic crisis, although they differ on the details of how reforms 
should be carried out. Ultimately, only the Government of Tunisia can 
ensure reforms are implemented.

    Question.  How does Tunisia implement IMF reforms and prevent 
instability and unrest?

    Answer. Reforms are critical to Tunisia's political and economic 
stability. President Saied has a crucial role to play in explaining to 
the public his economic reform priorities as well as their urgency and 
necessity. He will also need to help Tunisians understand his 
government's plans to mitigate the impact of reforms on vulnerable 
citizens. If confirmed, in collaboration with our G7 partners, I would 
encourage President Saied to increase his communication with the 
Tunisian people about the importance of implementing proposed reforms.

Chinese Influence
    Question. What are the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) goals in 
Tunisia?

    Answer. The People's Republic of China (PRC) has increased efforts 
in recent years to deepen ties with Tunisia. PRC companies are active 
in the technology and infrastructure sectors. If confirmed, I would 
highlight the risks associated with PRC engagement that could impact 
Tunisia's security and sovereignty, as well as U.S. interests.

    Question.  Given Tunisia's strategic location, how does the United 
States plan to compete with China--particularly given cuts to U.S. 
assistance?

    Answer. Increased engagement with the Tunisian people, civil 
society, and government officials will be vital to mitigate the 
influence of the PRC Government. The United States will continue to 
advance our strategic interests in the region through diplomatic 
engagement, public outreach, and judicious use of foreign assistance 
and other funding. We will also coordinate with like-minded partners to 
put forward alternatives to PRC offerings of concern. We will at times 
need to collaborate with Tunisian Government agencies and entities to 
counter PRC messaging, influence, and funding. This is particularly 
important given the dominance of state-owned monopolies in a number of 
key sectors, including all major critical infrastructure.

    Question.  How do you strike the appropriate balance between 
pushing Tunisia to adopt democratic reforms and competing with China's 
`no strings attached' approach?

    Answer. The PRC has sought to expand its influence where countries 
face significant economic challenges and/or lack deliberative 
democratic processes. If confirmed, I would highlight those democratic 
values--the free exchange of ideas, respect for the rule of law, 
transparency, and accountability--would best position Tunisia to 
safeguard its security, sovereignty, and future prosperity against 
unwanted outside influence.

Ukraine Invasion and Food Insecurity
    Question.  Tunisia is among the most vulnerable countries, relying 
on Ukraine and Russia for 56 percent of its annual wheat imports. Many 
on the Tunisian ``street'' have argued that food insecurity will set 
conditions for a potential ``revolution'' on your watch.

   What are the most effective methods to address Tunisia's food 
        security and mitigate the impacts of Russian aggression in 
        Ukraine?

    Answer. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has worsened inflation and 
increased food insecurity everywhere, so the international community 
must redouble diplomatic pressure on Russia to end Putin's war of 
choice. If confirmed, I would focus on working with international 
partners to mitigate the impact of Russia's aggression on food security 
in Tunisia and would encourage Tunisian efforts to increase domestic 
food production and implement economic reforms. I would speak out, 
publicly and privately, against any Russian misinformation and 
disinformation that Putin and his acts of aggression against Ukraine 
are responsible for energy price increases and food insecurity in 
Tunisia.

Abraham Accords and Normalization with Israel
    Question.  What are the prospects and associated benefits/pitfalls 
for Tunisian normalization with Israel?

    Answer. The normalization of relations with Israel, including 
through the historic Abraham Accords, has led to greater peace and 
security in the region and deepened opportunities for expanded economic 
growth and cooperation. Administration officials regularly discuss with 
our partners in the region the benefits of improved regional 
cooperation, including with Israel, and I would plan to do so with 
Tunisian officials and citizens, as well, if confirmed.


    Question.  With the constitutional referendum placing consolidated 
power in President Saied's hands, the slide towards authoritarianism 
fails to provide institutional guarantees for human rights. This has 
left many human rights groups concerned over the undermining of the 
judicial system and other post-revolutionary gains.

   What is your assessment of the current situation on democratic 
        backsliding in Tunisia and the possible implications on human 
        rights in the country?

    Answer. The Tunisian people have experienced an alarming erosion of 
democratic norms over the past year. Since July 25, 2021, the 
suspension of constitutional governance, consolidation of executive 
power, and weakening of independent institutions have raised deep 
questions about Tunisia's democratic path, both in Tunisia and 
internationally. Together with international partners, we have urged an 
inclusive democratic reform process, emphasized continued protection of 
fundamental freedoms, and insisted on respect for judicial 
independence, as well as the rule of law. The U.S.-Tunisia bilateral 
relationship is strongest when there is a shared commitment to 
democratic values, human rights, and fundamental freedoms.

    Question.  If confirmed, how would you work with the host 
government to bolster human rights amid backsliding?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would continue to engage with the Tunisian 
Government at the highest levels to advocate for democratic 
institutions. In tandem with international partners, the Administration 
will continue to urge the Government to return to democratic 
governance--including separation of powers via a functioning 
legislature and an independent judiciary--by conducting reforms in a 
transparent and inclusive way.


    Question.  The State Department's 2021 Human Rights Report on 
Tunisia noted significant human abuses of torture by government agents, 
arbitrary arrests, military prosecution of civilian cases, restrictions 
of freedoms of expression, corruption, and violent threats and 
criminalization against LGBTQI+ communities.

   If confirmed, what actions with civil society groups and the host 
        government would you take to address these violations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue to prioritize programming 
that reinforces rule of law, protects human rights, and empowers civil 
society. The administration has shifted our planned activities to 
bolster civil society oversight of the judiciary and law enforcement, 
increase access to justice, promote judicial independence, and 
strengthen accountability mechanisms. The Department requires vetting 
for Tunisian military and law enforcement personnel and units and 
conducts end use monitoring of transferred equipment.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons 
Report, Tunisia remained on Tier 2, showing some efforts to improve on 
meeting minimum requirements to eliminate trafficking but continued to 
stymie progress in a few key areas. The Government failed to 
appropriately identify victims and traffickers, and lacked training to 
sufficiently understand and address trafficking cases, leading to some 
victims being penalized for acts traffickers compelled them to commit.

   If confirmed, how will you work with Tunisian officials to increase 
        their efficiency at identification of trafficking victims and 
        traffickers?

    Answer. Although the Government of Tunisia demonstrated significant 
and increasing efforts to combat human trafficking in 2022, including 
by convicting sex and labor traffickers for the first time in three 
years and significantly increasing investigations and prosecutions of 
traffickers, more can be done. If confirmed, I will continue to urge 
the Government to hold sex and labor traffickers criminally accountable 
using Tunisia's 2016 anti-trafficking law, which does meet 
international standards.

    Question.  If confirmed, what concrete steps could you take in your 
mission and with the host government to assist Tunisia to better meet 
the minimum standards and promote anti-trafficking work?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work closely with the Office to 
Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP Office) to continue to 
implement anti-trafficking programming, in addition to engaging with 
the Government to make progress on the priority recommendations noted 
in the 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report in order to meet the minimum 
standards for the elimination of trafficking. I would support the TIP 
Office's goal of measurably reducing human trafficking by building the 
capacity of government and justice sector officials to investigate and 
prosecute trafficking cases, as well as more effectively identify and 
protect trafficking victims through adequate care and legal 
representation.

    Question.  Previously, Tunisia was a country with Islam as its 
official religion, and a 99 percent Sunni Muslim majority. In the new 
constitution, Tunisia is no longer an Islamic State.

   What is your assessment of the implications for religious 
        minorities following the removal of Islam as the country's 
        religion from Article I of the constitution?

    Answer. It remains too early to tell what the implications for 
religious minorities will be following the removal from the 
constitution of the mention of Islam as the religion of the state. The 
constitution still notes that Tunisia is part of the Islamic community. 
If confirmed, I would continue to speak out against laws and policies 
that impede or threaten freedom of religion and would continue to 
stress with the Government the need to respect religious freedom for 
all, including members of Tunisia's religious minority groups.

    Question.  Prior to referendum, the 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report from the State Department notes that some religious 
minorities feel societal pressure to hide their beliefs and are not 
given full recognition of their religious rights. If confirmed, what 
actions would you take with the Tunisian Government to improve 
recognition of religious freedoms for all religions?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to working with others in the 
Department, including the Office of International Religious Freedom, to 
advance freedom of religion for all people, including members of 
religious minority groups. I would also hold regular meetings and 
discussions with members of religious minority and majority communities 
throughout the country and lead the mission in highlighting the 
importance of protecting members of religious minority groups and 
promoting interfaith dialogue.

    Question.  The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the U.N., including in elections 
for specialized bodies like the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who if 
elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. 
She is in a tough race that will require early, consistent engagement 
across capitals and within the U.N. member states.

   If confirmed, do you commit to demarche the Tunisian Government and 
        any other counterparts necessary to encourage their support of 
        Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question.  If confirmed, how can you work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify, recruit, 
and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior Program 
Officer (JPO) program at the U.N.?

    Answer. The Junior Professional Officer program is one of the key 
opportunities offered by the U.N. to encourage young professionals 
interested in serving in international organizations, and it provides 
them with hands-on experience across various U.N. agencies. If 
confirmed, I will work with the IO Bureau to identify qualified and 
diverse candidates for the JPO program.

    Question. Tunisia has one of the lowest rates of voting coincidence 
with the U.S. in the U.N. General Assembly and in the Security Council.

   What is your assessment of this issue?

    Answer. Tunisia supported two significant U.N. votes on Ukraine. If 
confirmed, I would continue to lobby Tunisia in support of other U.S. 
policy priorities at the U.N.

    Question.  If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to 
engage with the [Tunisians] on anticipated votes in the U.N. system 
that would increase their voting coincidence with the U.S.?

    Answer. Tunisia voted in favor of U.S.-sponsored U.N. General 
Assembly resolutions on Ukraine on March 25 (humanitarian resolution) 
and March 2 (resolution condemning Russia's invasion). If confirmed, I 
will continue to lobby Tunisia to support U.S. policy priorities at the 
U.N.

            state department management and public diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID.

   What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission Tunis?

    Answer. Mission Tunis, including the co-located Libya External 
Office, includes a high number of families and has strong morale, in 
part because Mission Tunis offers a number of job opportunities for 
qualified family members. The biggest issue affecting our locally 
employed staff's morale is wages. Their salaries remain roughly 65 
percent of people doing comparable work in the local labor market and 
are not keeping up with inflation. The Embassy has established a 
Mission-wide wage working group to analyze wage and inflation trends. 
If confirmed, I would work diligently to ensure that mission moral 
remains high for all employees, in part by ensuring that all colleagues 
feel valued, supported, and respected.

    Question.  How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Tunis?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to working closely with my 
leadership team to promote an environment that recruits for diversity 
and hires for merit, while also promoting inclusion on a daily basis. I 
would also continue focusing on the professional development of all 
employees and find creative ways to foster a good work-life balance 
despite high work demands. I am also committed to working closely with 
our locally employed staff to understand their concerns regarding their 
wages and would advocate for them where appropriate to ensure Mission 
Tunis can retain and continue to recruit strong talent.

    Question.  How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Tunis?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would meet early and regularly with 
colleagues throughout the Mission, and work with my interagency team to 
formulate, disseminate, and implement our unified mission vision.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I rely on an inclusive management vision, inviting 
colleagues of all backgrounds to share ideas and concerns as we 
formulate ways to advance U.S. interests. Once our vision is set, I 
consult regularly with people from across the organization to ensure 
they have the support and tools they need to fulfill their roles, and 
when they do not, I direct or advocate for change.

    Question.  Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No. It is never acceptable to berate subordinates.

    Question.  How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. I would entrust my Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) with being 
my ``alter ego,'' able to step in and lead any aspect of the mission at 
a moment's notice. To empower the DCM to be success in that role, I 
would ensure that they are privy to all appropriate information and 
included in all substantial decisions before they are made. I would 
also ensure that they have a public role and meaningful relationships 
with government officials to complement my efforts or stand in for me 
as needed.

    Question.  If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. In addition to the responsibilities described above, I 
would entrust my DCM with mentoring and guiding our more junior 
colleagues, playing the role of chief of staff for agency and section 
heads, presiding over the emergency action and family advocacy 
committees, and working closely with our Community Liaison Officer and 
others to ensure high mission morale.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. I firmly believe that providing employees with timely, 
accurate and constructive feedback is not only important but a key 
responsibility of all managers to ensure we can address any potential 
issues before they turn into serious problems. It is also a key way of 
recognizing and encouraging high performing employees and to inspire 
others to do the same. For our locally employed staff, I am very happy 
that Embassy Tunis will be one of the first posts in the Bureau of Near 
Eastern Affairs to implement Merit Based Compensation which I believe 
can be an effective tool to provide accurate and constructive feedback 
coupled with training plans focused on professional development.

    Question.  If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Tunisia.

   T1 In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our embassy 
        walls enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. U.S. diplomats are consistently in the field with grantees, 
implementing partners, and beneficiaries of economic assistance and 
public diplomacy programs, as well as local politicians, religious 
leaders, civil society activists, and businesspeople. We conduct robust 
outreach for educational, cultural, and exchange initiatives, as well 
as to correct the record of misinformation about the United States. If 
confirmed, I would continue these activities and seek ways to expand 
them, not just for myself but for all my colleagues.

    Question.  How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. Host country engagement is a critical component of 
diplomacy. If confirmed, I will work closely with my Regional Security 
Office to ensure that our diplomats able to safely accomplish our 
mission. Mission Tunis has a range of projects funded by the U.S. 
Government that are creating new job opportunities and providing relief 
to small businesses hardest hit by COVID. Those are important to 
highlight, celebrate, and build upon. There are also 73 American 
companies operating in Tunisia. If confirmed, I would encourage 
diplomats to visit these sites and partners to gain a deeper 
understanding of the economic needs facing average Tunisians and to 
highlight the economic investments that the United States is making in 
support of the people of both our countries.

    Question.  Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in 
Tunisia?

    Answer. Most Tunisians are enthusiastic consumers of American 
culture, so there is a great appetite for our educational, cultural and 
exchange programs. We have been able to reach our audience both in 
person and through a highly engaged social media environment. Many 
young Tunisians prefer to learn English and eagerly participate in our 
English language programs. The opportunities for our public engagement, 
especially in underserved areas outside of the large cities, are nearly 
endless. Our public diplomacy programs are making a real difference in 
the quality of life for thousands of young Tunisians through enhanced 
educational opportunities and, skills development.
    If confirmed, I would both participate in and strongly encourage 
outreach throughout Tunisia, particularly to historically underserved 
regions. and communities, in order to connect with a diverse range of 
Tunisian voices and U.S. voices. Public diplomacy is an important 
aspect of U.S. foreign policy efforts.

    Question.  What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. Tunisia is marked by a sometimes-slow bureaucracy, and 
security restrictions that preclude U.S. diplomats, some of our 
visiting experts, and cultural performers from traveling to some parts 
of the country. The growing but limited use of English can also present 
challenges. Russian and PRC misinformation and disinformation also pose 
challenges.

    Question.  How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. Main State provides guidance and support to our public 
diplomacy colleagues at Embassy Tunis for all our programs. The Public 
Affairs Section, on the other hand, provides insights on in-country 
developments, which helps them to appropriately match public diplomacy 
resources and programs with mission goals. This balance is crucial to 
achieving our policy objectives.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I would have no higher priority than the 
security and safety of Americans in Tunisia. I will commit to taking 
all anomalous health incident reports seriously and to investigate them 
in a transparent manner.

    Question.  If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Tunis personnel?

    Answer. Yes.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
                 to Joey R. Hood by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. Over the last several years, Tunisia and the People's 
Republic of China (PRC) have signed a series of agreements to develop 
closer economic, cultural, and technology ties. The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) is filling a vacuum left by the lack of investment from 
Europe, the United States, and the Gulf States, who have all 
prioritized other countries.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. We are proud to be Tunisia's security partner of choice and 
we continue to share deep economic and cultural ties with Tunisia. If 
confirmed, I would seek to maintain those relationships, in part by 
highlighting the risks associated with PRC engagement that could weaken 
Tunisia's security and sovereignty, and damage U.S. interests. 
Increased engagement with the Tunisian people, civil society, and 
government officials will be vital to mitigate concerning PRC efforts 
to influence Tunisia.

    Question. Does growing CCP influence in Tunisia threaten U.S. 
interests?

    Answer. The PRC has increased efforts in recent years to deepen 
ties with Tunisia. PRC companies are active in the technology and 
infrastructure sectors. If confirmed, I would seek to expand our 
efforts to promote a fair and equitable business climate for the 
benefit of U.S. investors and the security of our allies and partners. 
I would also strive to engage and educate decision makers in the 
Tunisian public and private sectors on the implications of PRC 
engagement in key areas such as smart cities and 5G technology.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to further encourage 
stronger ties between Tunisia, the United States, and its allies?

    Answer. The United States and Tunisia share deep economic, 
cultural, and military ties. If confirmed, I would promote a vision of 
inclusive, open economic growth, and stronger ties with U.S. companies. 
I would seek every opportunity to engage Tunisian civil society and 
urge the Government to see civil society as a partner in advancing 
democratic principles, public health, education, and human rights. If 
confirmed, I would help strengthen our robust security partnership for 
the benefit of both the United States and Tunisia. In tandem with 
international partners, I would continue to publicly and privately 
advocate for a swift return to democratic governance.

    Question. What are the prospects of incorporating Tunisia into the 
Abraham Accords?

    Answer. The normalization of relations with Israel, including 
through the historic Abraham Accords, has led to greater peace and 
security in the region, and has deepened opportunities for expanded 
economic growth and cooperation. Administration officials regularly 
discuss the benefits of improved regional cooperation, including with 
Israel, with our partners in the region, and I would seek every 
opportunity to do so with Tunisian officials and citizens.

    Question. Over the last year, President Kais Saied has dismantled 
the hard-fought gains of Tunisia's Arab spring. From dissolving the 
parliament to pushing through constitutional reforms to strengthen his 
power, President Saied is increasingly emulating his authoritarian 
predecessors. What is your assessment of the erosion of Tunisian 
democracy?

    Answer. The Tunisian people have experienced an alarming erosion of 
democratic norms over the past year. Since July 25, 2021, the 
suspension of constitutional governance, consolidation of executive 
power, and weakening of independent institutions have raised deep 
questions about Tunisia's democratic path, both in Tunisia and 
internationally. Together with international partners, the 
Administration has urged an inclusive democratic reform process, 
emphasized continued protection of fundamental freedoms, and insisted 
on respect for judicial independence and the rule of law. The U.S.-
Tunisia bilateral relationship is strongest when there is a shared 
commitment to democratic values, human rights, and fundamental 
freedoms.

    Question. Does this erosion of democracy present an opening for the 
CCP to increase its influence in Tunisia and North Africa?

    Answer. The PRC has increased efforts in recent years to deepen 
ties with Tunisia. In other contexts, the PRC has sought to expand its 
influence where countries face significant economic challenges or lack 
deliberative democratic processes. Increased engagement with the 
Tunisian people, civil society, and government officials will be vital 
to mitigate PRC influence of concern.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to reverse this erosion?

    Answer. The United States and international partners continue to 
call for an inclusive and transparent dialogue on Tunisia's political 
future. We acknowledge the concerns of many Tunisians regarding the 
lack of such a process, as well as the erosion of democratic 
institutions that could threaten Tunisia's democracy and respect for 
human rights. If confirmed, I would encourage Tunisia's leaders to 
forge an inclusive and accountable government that preserves the space 
for free debate and dissent, promotes long-term economic prosperity, 
and establishes the checks and balances critical to the health of all 
democracies. I would also seek every opportunity to engage Tunisian 
civil society and urge the Government to see civil society as a 
partner.

    Question. Noting Tunisia's support for U.N. resolutions on the 
humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, how do you plan to urge Tunisia to 
maintain solidarity with the Ukrainian people, as well as mitigate the 
negative impact of Russia's invasion on international food security?

    Answer. Tunisia imports over half of its wheat from the Black Sea 
region. The Russian attack against Ukraine has worsened inflation and 
increased food insecurity, including in Tunisia. We must all redouble 
diplomatic pressure on Russia to end this invasion. If confirmed, I 
would focus on working with international partners to mitigate the 
impact of Russia's aggression on food security in Tunisia and would 
encourage Tunisian efforts to increase domestic food production. I 
would also speak out, publicly and privately, against any Russian 
misinformation to make sure people in Tunisia understand that Putin and 
his acts of aggression against Ukraine are responsible for energy price 
increases and food insecurity.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
             Submitted to Joey R. Hood by Senator Ted Cruz

    Question. On April 16, 2022 you sent an e-mail to NEA saying ``over 
the past several months, a number of people have reported comments that 
certain candidates could not be hired because they are straight white 
men, they are not of the `right' religion.'' On July 26, State Dept. 
Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Abercrombie-Winstanley testified 
that she had never seen or cleared that email. Chairman Menendez stated 
immediately after her testimony that ``if there is an attribution then 
that person should come forward and it should be fully investigated 
what he has to say.''

   Please clarify the circumstances surrounding you sending that 
        email.

   Please list all State Department officials who cleared that email 
        and/or the guidance in that email.

   How many comments of that nature were reported to you?

   For each comment that was conveyed to you, please describe it.

   For each comment that was conveyed to you, who made those comments?

   For each comment that was conveyed to you, when were they made?

   Please provide all documents and materials related to the comments, 
        including emails, memos, cables, notes, decision memos, 
        briefing papers, instructions, etc. These should include any 
        documents or materials related to the comments themselves, as 
        well as to the drafting, clearing, and publishing of the email.

   Regarding the comment that people could not be hired because they 
        are not of the `right' religion: what religion was being 
        referenced?

   Sen. Menendez called on the author of that email to come forward 
        and have the circumstances surrounding the email fully 
        investigated. Why have you not come forward?

    Answer. The functions and duties of a Principal Deputy Assistant 
Secretary at the Department of State routinely include carrying out a 
variety of managerial roles, including recruitment of personnel from 
inside the Department to fill the Bureau's domestic and overseas 
positions. That personnel role includes ensuring that all Bureau 
personnel are aware that all personnel actions are taken in compliance 
with applicable rules and regulations, including Equal Employment 
Opportunity (EEO) laws that prohibit employment discrimination on the 
basis of (in relevant part) race, sex, religion, and disability. As 
Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Near Eastern 
Affairs, I was reminding our Bureau colleagues to follow EEO laws 
during the upcoming Foreign Service assignment season, as is done each 
year during assignment cycles. The email represented a restatement of 
longstanding Department polices and reflected review by the NEA front 
office and Department officials responsible for diversity, equity, and 
inclusion policy.
    All of the hearsay discussions mentioned in the notice e-mail came 
to my attention during the approximate time period of January to April 
2022 in the prelude to assignment season. Because these were all 
multiple hearsay examples of ``water cooler chatter,'' there was not a 
basis for specific action and the appropriate course was to remind the 
Bureau to adhere to EEO laws, as I did in the email, using these 
hearsay comments as illustrative examples of colloquial things 
colleagues may have heard but cannot be a factor in our assignments 
process

    Question. On January 7, 2022, the State Department issued a cable 
with guidance for overseas engagement with Iranian opposition groups. 
The guidance limited and, in many cases, prohibited officials from 
meeting with any such groups, and it described several specific ones. 
The guidance was reversed within a week. You are the official who 
approved the cable.

   Please clarify the circumstances surrounding you approving that 
        cable. Why did you approve it?

    Answer. When I reviewed that cable, it had already been reviewed by 
both career and political appointee professionals in the office of the 
Special Envoy for Iran, which indicated that the guidance in the cable 
was consistent with the then-Special Envoy's policy on Iran. My review 
of the cable, as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for NEA, was part 
of an institutional process to ensure coordination and deconfliction on 
issues not covered by the Special Envoy. My review did not reveal 
anything in other areas of USG policy that prohibited the content or 
intent of the cable.

    Question. Do you believe that the cable and guidance accurately 
reflected the Trump administration's policy?

   If so, please explain why you believe it was reversed within a 
        week.

    Answer. For decades, including during the Trump administration, the 
Department has managed and tracked contact between U.S. personnel, 
Iranian officials, and Iranian opposition groups. I understand the 
initial cable providing guidance on contact between U.S. personnel and 
Iranian opposition groups went into unnecessary detail about these 
groups and buried the main message, which was made explicit in the 
cable that superseded it the following week. That message stated that 
standing with the Iranian people was a cornerstone of the Trump 
administration's policy, and U.S. diplomats should engage actively with 
the Iranian diaspora but contact headquarters for specific guidance 
before engaging with representatives of opposition groups, since not 
all of them share objectives and interests that align with U.S. policy.

    Question. Please list all State Department officials who cleared 
that cable and/or the guidance in that cable.

    Answer. Both career and political officials in all relevant offices 
of the Department reviewed the cable, including the Secretary's Iran 
Action Group (which at that time included the Special Envoy for Iran), 
the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, the Office of the Legal 
Advisor, the Office of the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, the 
Office of the Deputy Secretary of State, the Secretary's Policy 
Planning Staff, the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, the 
Counter Terrorism Bureau, the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, the 
Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, the Bureau of European Affairs, 
the Bureau of African Affairs, and the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific 
Affairs.

    Question. The cable stated that engagement with opposition groups 
would be counterproductive to pressuring Iran into a comprehensive deal 
with Iran. Do you still agree with this assessment?

    Answer. I believe that the second cable stated administration 
policy much more clearly than the first one did: not all Iranian 
opposition groups' interests and priorities align with U.S. policy 
priorities. I agree with that assessment.

    Question. Do you believe that American overseas posts should limit 
their engagement with Iranian opposition groups?

    Answer. I am a firm believer in outreach to the Iranian people, 
both inside and outside Iran, which is why I led efforts in 2012 to 
create the first U.S. Government website dedicated to engaging with 
them. Recognizing the danger efforts like this represented to their 
rule, the regime blocked the site the day after it was launched and 
intensified its crackdown on Internet freedom. I believe that U.S. 
diplomats should use good judgment and seek guidance from the 
Department in engaging with representatives of Iranian opposition 
groups with which Department officials are not already in regular 
contact.

    Question. In early 2021 the State Department distributed internal 
guidance through emails about how to refer to the normalization between 
Israel and other countries. In the emails, staffers were instructed 
that the State Dept. would no longer refer to the normalization as the 
``Abraham Accords,'' and the use of ``normalization agreements'' 
instead was indicated, according to a June 4 report by the Washington 
Free Beacon. You told me that in our interview that you do not remember 
any memo relating to that guidance.

   Did you know the guidance was being issued?

    Answer. No. I do not recall seeing such guidance.

    Question. Did you clear any such guidance, as described in the 
emails revealed by the Washington Free Beacon?

    Answer. I do not recall clearing any such guidance.

    Question. Do you agree that State Department officials should not 
use the phrase ``Abraham Accords?''

    Answer. No. I believe that Department officials should celebrate 
the historic achievement represented by the Abraham Accords, which is 
why I fully supported prominent public statements by administration 
officials on the one-year anniversary of their signing. In addition, I 
worked diligently to help the Accords bear fruit for the United States, 
our partner Israel, and the United Arab Emirates by helping to lead 
efforts within the Department to establish the Israel-India-United 
States-United Arab Emirates grouping (I2U2) and recommending that 
senior officials support the initiative. Secretary Blinken participated 
in an inaugural meeting of the I2U2 foreign ministers in October 2021, 
and on July 14, President Biden participated in an I2U2 summit meeting 
to announce major joint investment projects. In their joint statement, 
the leaders said, ``We reaffirm our support for the Abraham Accords and 
other peace and normalization arrangements with Israel. We welcome the 
economic opportunities that flow from these historic developments.'' I 
also strongly supported senior Department officials engaging in the 
U.S.-Israel-UAE Religious Co-Existence Working Group, including 
approving the following quote from an Under Secretary of State for the 
joint statement: ``The Abraham Accords represent one of the most 
significant strategic shifts over my three decades of diplomacy in this 
region and bring clear-cut benefits not just to the countries and 
peoples concerned, but to the rest of the world as well.''

    Question. Please transmit copies of those emails. The Washington 
Free Beacon reviewed at least two of them.

    Answer. I do not recall seeing any such emails and any such e-mails 
are records of the State Department, which I do not control.

    Question. Please transmit any other internal guidance--emails, 
memos, cables, notes, decision memos, briefing papers, instructions, 
etc.--that instructed staffers not to use the phrase ``Abraham 
Accords.''

    Answer. I do not recall seeing any such internal guidance and any 
such documents are records of the State Department, which I do not 
control.

                   follow up questions submitted to 
                 joey r. hood by senator cruz--number 1
          Question. In the QFRs submitted pursuant to your nomination,, 
        I asked you about guidance distributed within the State 
        Department in early 2021 which instructed staffers to no longer 
        refer to the Abraham Accords as ``Abraham Accords,'' but 
        instead to call them ``normalization agreements.'' The 
        existence of the guidance was revealed by the Washington Free 
        Beacon (WFB) in a June 4 article. I asked you whether you 
        cleared that guidance, and asked that you transmit copies of 
        that or any other ``internal guidance . . . that instructed 
        staffers not to use the phrase `Abraham Accords.' '' You 
        repeatedly stated that you don't recall clearing or seeing any 
        such guidance.
          On June 27, 2021 you and other senior administration 
        officials held a briefing for journalists in Rome, Italy. 
        Secretary Blinken and Israeli PM Yair Lapid had just met. State 
        Department Spokesperson Ned Price also participated in that 
        briefing. The briefing was held on deep background. The WFB 
        article about the ``Abraham Accords'' guidance had been 
        published earlier that month. In that briefing, you told 
        journalists that you had been involved in clearing the 
        guidance.


     Do you recall saying that or anything similar in the briefing, 
            and if not do you recall discussing the guidance at all in 
            the briefing?

          Answer. I do not recall discussing any Department guidance in 
        that briefing, but I recall responding to questions on this 
        matter by saying effectively to ``blame the misunderstanding on 
        me as the Acting Assistant Secretary for the Near Eastern 
        Affairs Bureau.'' In doing so, I sought to put an end to media 
        speculation that there had been such guidance and instead to 
        explain that there had been working-level discussion about how 
        to focus on widening and deepening not just the historic 
        Abraham Accords, but also the peace treaties, and other 
        agreements between our partner Israel and its neighbors, as 
        well as Israel and non-Muslim majority countries. At no time 
        did the Secretary stop referring to the Abraham Accords as 
        ``the Abraham Accords,'' and the Department, with the Bureau of 
        Near Eastern Affairs, released statements celebrating their 
        one-year anniversary shortly after that briefing, referring to 
        them as the Abraham Accords. The Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs 
        also organized remarks and an event the Secretary co-hosted 
        with then-Foreign Minister Yair Lapid (a virtual ministerial) 
        in honor of the Abraham Accords' first anniversary.

          Question. Hady Amr, who currently serves as the Special 
        Representative for Palestinian Affairs within the Department's 
        Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, has consistently been involved 
        in producing press guidance relating to Israel. For example, on 
        July 6 and 7, he generated guidance in response to a story 
        published in the WFB alleging that the State Department had 
        misled Congress about Palestinian terrorism. Mr. Arm was 
        involved in generating that guidance starting July 6 after the 
        story was flagged for him by Spokesperson Price and he cleared 
        that guidance on July 7 for NEA/FO, the Bureau's front office. 
        The guidance was then collected and distributed. The email 
        thread was titled ``GC on response to Free Beacon Article on 
        Pal Congressional Report and Response to question on Abraham 
        Fund.''


     Please described any role played by Mr. Amr in also generating 
            the early 2021 guidance instructing staffers not to use the 
            phrase ``Abraham Accords'' but to use ``normalization 
            agreements'' instead.

          Answer. I do not recall any guidance generated by Mr. Amr of 
        this nature.

          Question. Did you clear any such guidance, as described in 
        the emails revealed by the Washington Free Beacon and as you 
        discussed with journalists on June 27 in Rome?

          Answer. I do not recall clearing any such guidance and I have 
        provided my recollection of the June 27 press backgrounder in 
        Rome on this issue.

          Question. Are you aware of anyone else at the State 
        Department who cleared such guidance?

          Answer. I am not aware of anyone else at the Department who 
        cleared any such guidance.

          Question. In the QFRs submitted pursuant to your nomination, 
        I asked you to list all State Department officials who cleared 
        the email that you sent on April 16, 2022, in which you stated 
        that a number of people had reported comments that certain 
        candidates could not be hired because of race, gender, and 
        religious considerations. I noted that State Dept. Chief 
        Diversity and Inclusion Officer Abercrombie-Winstanley 
        separately testified that she had never seen or cleared that 
        email. I also asked you ``Regarding the comment that people 
        could not be hired because they are not of the `right' 
        religion: what religion was being referenced?'' In your answer 
        you did [not] clarify any aspect of these circumstances or 
        questions.


     Did you report or refer any of the comments described in your 
            April 16, 2022 to the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, or 
            discuss any of those comments with anyone in the Office of 
            Diversity and Inclusion? If so, which officials? If not, 
            why not?

          Answer. I reported, referred, and discussed the relevant 
        comments with the relevant offices of the Department, which 
        included the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.

          Question. Regarding the comment that people could not be 
        hired because they are not of the `right' religion: what 
        religion was being referenced?

          Answer. The Department does not take into account a person's 
        religious faith in hiring decisions. This comment came in the 
        context of someone wondering whether a non-Muslim could prove 
        as effective as a Muslim engaging on issues related to Muslim-
        majority countries. No hiring decision was made on the basis of 
        this comment.

                   follow up questions submitted to 
                 joey r. hood by senator cruz--number 2
          Question. In the QFRs submitted pursuant to your nomination, 
        and again in follow up questions, I asked you about guidance 
        distributed within the State Department in early 2021 which 
        instructed staffers to no longer refer to the Abraham Accords 
        as ``Abraham Accords,'' but instead to call them 
        ``normalization agreements.'' In follow up questions, I asked 
        you about a briefing for journalists that took place on June 27 
        in which you participated, and specifically about any comments 
        you made related to that early 2021 ``Abraham Accords'' 
        guidance. You said that you told reporters ``effectively to 
        `blame the misunderstanding on [you] as the Acting Assistant 
        Secretary for the Near Eastern Affairs Bureau.' '' I also asked 
        you about any role played by then-Deputy Assistant Secretary 
        (DAS) for Israel and Palestinian Affairs Hady Amr in generating 
        or clearing the guidance about not using ``Abraham Accords.'' 
        You said you did ``not recall any guidance generated by Mr. Amr 
        of this nature.''
          On Feb 4, 2021 Rachel Rubin, the press officer for Israel and 
        Palestinian Affairs in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs 
        (NEA), emailed Meghan Dean, another press officer, saying ``we 
        are no longer using 'Abraham Accords' to refer to the 
        normalization of relations between Israel and other 
        countries.'' The email instructed staffers that further 
        language would be sent when the language was ``cleared'' and 
        that no references should be made to Abraham Accords in the 
        meantime. Hady Amr was then DAS for Israel and Palestinian 
        Affairs. The email thread was about Mr. Amr's calls to 
        counterparts and public affairs guidance about those calls.


     Were you aware of this specific email or the instructions 
            referenced in the email?

          Answer. No.

          Question. Did you clear this specific email or the 
        instructions referenced in the email?

          Answer. I do not recall clearing this specific email or the 
        instructions referenced in them.

          Question. The email instructed staffers to wait for new 
        language that would not include ``Abraham Accords.'' Did you 
        clear such new language on or after Feb 4, i.e. not the 
        guidance but new language written in line with that guidance?

          Answer. I do not recall clearing new language on or after 
        February 4. I recall a number of working-level conversations, 
        stretching back into the Trump administration, about how to 
        refer to Israel's past and potential future agreements with its 
        Arab neighbors in a way that would maximize the chances of 
        deepening existing agreements and reaching new agreements. In 
        those conversations, it was noted that the Kingdom of Morocco 
        declined to join the Abraham Accords, pursuing instead an 
        agreement under its own terms, and that other governments 
        wanted their treaties with Israel recognized in public as such. 
        There was broad consensus at the working level that other Arab 
        countries seeking to establish diplomatic relations with our 
        partner Israel would likely do so not by joining the Abraham 
        Accords, but by forging their own understandings. All of these 
        factors gave rise to working-level discussions about how to 
        refer to present and future agreements in the most inclusive 
        fashion possible, but they did not, to my knowledge, result in 
        a written policy not to refer to Israel's agreements with the 
        UAE and Bahrain as the ``Abraham Accords.'' This is why many 
        U.S. officials, including our Charges d'Affaires in Abu Dhabi, 
        Manama, and Jerusalem, as well as the Secretary of State and 
        others, never stopped using the term in public discourse, and 
        it is also why I cleared on the concept proposal and the 
        remarks used when the Secretary hosted a ministerial and issued 
        statements celebrating the one-year anniversary of the Abraham 
        Accords. I also supported the Bureau's work to take advantage 
        of the historic nature of the Abraham Accords to foster 
        investment agreements between the Abraham Accords signatories 
        and India.

          Question. These instructions reversed a core priority of the 
        previous administration. They were generated in reference to 
        calls made by Mr. Amr, in a policy area overseen by Mr. Amr, 
        and sent by the press staffer responsible for public affairs in 
        that policy.


   In your experience in NEA, what would be the role of the DAS of the 
        relevant office in generating such instructions?

          Answer. In general, the bureau's press officers draft 
        language that is then cleared by a desk officer, office 
        director and/or the DAS, among others.

          Question. In your experience in NEA, what would be the role 
        of the DAS of the relevant office in clearing such 
        instructions?

          Answer. In general, press guidance is cleared by a desk 
        officer, office director, or DAS.

          Question. Would be it unusual for those instructions to be 
        generated without input from that DAS?

          Answer. No.

          Question. Would be it unusual for those instructions to be 
        distributed without being cleared by that DAS?

          Answer. No.

          Question. Would it be unusual for those instructions to be 
        generated without input from the subject of the guidance, i.e. 
        Mr. Amr?

          Answer. No.

          Question. Would it be unusual for those instructions to be 
        distributed without input from the subject of the guidance, 
        i.e. Mr. Amr?

          Answer. No.

          Question. Please describe any role played by Mr. Amr in 
        formulating these instructions or having them distributed, 
        including asking for them to be generated or clearing them.

          Answer. I am not aware of any role played by Mr. Amr in 
        formulating, generating, or clearing these instructions or 
        having them distributed.

          Question. In the QFRs submitted pursuant to your nomination, 
        and again in follow up questions, I asked you about an email 
        that you sent on April 16, 2022, in which you stated that a 
        number of people had reported comments that certain candidates 
        could not be hired because of race, gender, and religious 
        considerations. I noted that State Dept. Chief Diversity and 
        Inclusion Officer Abercrombie-Winstanley separately testified 
        that she had never seen or cleared that email. In your response 
        to follow up questions, you said that you ``reported, referred, 
        and discussed the relevant comments with the relevant offices 
        of the Department, which included the Office of Diversity and 
        Inclusion.''


   Did you ever report, refer, or discuss these comments with Chief 
        Diversity and Inclusion Officer Abercrombie-Winstanley? If so, 
        please describe the nature of the discussion, if not, why not?

          Answer. I reported these general comments and sentiments to 
        Ambassador Abercrombie-Winstanley, and discussed that hiring 
        decisions should never be made on the basis of gender, race, 
        religion, and disability. I sent that guidance email in order 
        to stress that such comments and sentiments do not comport with 
        Department policy, and would be prohibited if part of a hiring 
        decision. I am not aware of any hiring decisions made on the 
        basis of these comments.

          Question. Are you aware of anyone else who reported, 
        referred, or discussed these comments with Chief Diversity and 
        Inclusion Officer Abercrombie-Winstanley?

          Answer. No.

          Question. Do you consider the comments to have been 
        sufficiently acute that they should have been elevated to Chief 
        Diversity and Inclusion Officer Abercrombie-Winstanley?

          Answer. Yes, as a policy matter, which is why I sought the 
        Ambassador's input, though the CDIO has no operational role in 
        the day-to-day EEO law administration.

                 joey r. hood by senator cruz--number 3
          Question. In the QFRs submitted pursuant to your nomination, 
        and again in follow up questions, I asked about guidance 
        distributed within the State Department in early 2021 which 
        instructed staffers to no longer refer to the Abraham Accords 
        as ``Abraham Accords,'' but instead to call them 
        ``normalization agreements.'' The guidance was distributed on 
        Feb 4 in an email between press staffers with the instruction 
        ``we are no longer using 'Abraham Accords' to refer to the 
        normalization of relations between Israel and other 
        countries.''
          On June 27 you told reporters in Rome, Italy ``effectively to 
        `blame the misunderstanding on [you] as the Acting Assistant 
        Secretary for the Near Eastern Affairs Bureau.' '' Nevertheless 
        you have said that you were not aware of the Feb 4 email or the 
        instructions to use ``normalization agreements'' instead of 
        ``Abraham Accords.'' I am seeking to clarify the degree to 
        which you knew about the existence of this policy and any 
        actions you took regarding it, or whether the policy had been 
        set from within your bureau and for the State Department 
        without your knowledge.
          On April 1, 2021, Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters that 
        he was capable of saying the words ``Abraham Accords'' but that 
        the State Department ``call[s] them normalization agreements.'' 
        The full exchange was extensive and received broad coverage--




                  ``Question: Okay. And then just as an aside, what 
                does this--what do you call these agreements between--

                  ``Mr. Price: They're normalization agreements.

                  ``Question: Yeah, but what are the--what is the name

                ``Mr. Price: Normalization agreements.

                  ``Question: No, there's a specific name that they all 
                signed onto. I believe you know what it is.

                  ``Mr. Price: Look, we call them--we call them 
                normalization agreements. That's--

                  ``Question: Why do you not--

                  ``Mr. Price: That's precisely what they are.

                  ``Question: --use the name that the leaders of these 
                countries signed onto--

                  ``Mr. Price: We're--

                  ``Question: --which is the Abraham Accords? Why is 
                that--

                  ``Mr. Price: I'm not averse to using that. I'm 
                describing what these are. These are normalization--

                  ``Question: Well, then can you say it for me, please?

                  ``Mr. Price: Of course I can say the term ``Abraham 
                Accords,'' Matt.

                  ``Question: Thank you.

                  ``Mr. Price: But we call them normalization 
                agreements.''



          Question. On June 4 the Washington Free Beacon reported the 
        existence of the policy, citing ``one source with direct 
        knowledge'' and ``two internal State Department emails'' 
        reviewed by the outlet. The State Department did not deny the 
        details of the story, and indeed it is now clear that they 
        could not deny it.

     Did you ever become aware of the existence of the State 
            Department policy instructing inter alia public affairs 
            staffers to only refer to the ``Abraham Accords'' as 
            ``normalization agreements?'' If so, please describe when 
            and how you became aware of the policy, and whether you 
            sought to have it reversed.

          Answer. I do not recall becoming aware of any such Department 
        policy instructing anyone to refer to the Abraham Accords 
        exclusively as ``normalization agreements.''

          Question. Regarding Spokesperson Price's April 1 press 
        briefing in which he said that the State Department ``call[s] 
        them normalization agreements'' not ``Abraham Accords'': did 
        you discuss that statement with him after the briefing in any 
        way (e.g. personally, phone, email, text, chat, etc.)? For 
        example, did you ask him whether that was actually the State 
        Department's policy, why it was the policy, who set it, when it 
        was set, and so on? If you did not, why not? If so, please 
        describe the exchanges.

          Answer. I recall that there were working-level discussions, 
        stretching back into the Trump administration, about how to 
        refer to Israel's past and potential future agreements with its 
        Arab neighbors in a way that would maximize the chances of 
        deepening existing agreements and reaching new agreements, 
        because it was clear that other governments may not wish to 
        join the Accords but to forge their own normalization 
        agreements with Israel. I do not recall asking Mr. Price if it 
        was Department policy not to refer to the Abraham Accords as 
        such because I do not recall believing that this was Department 
        policy, having witnessed the Secretary, our Charges d'Affaires 
        in Jerusalem, Abu Dhabi, and Manama, as well as other senior 
        U.S. officials, refer to the Abraham Accords as such on a 
        regular basis. I recall discussing with Mr. Price and others, 
        however, that it was becoming clear--as evidenced by the April 
        1 press briefing and the Washington Free Beacon article--that 
        there was some public misperception about the Biden 
        administration's appreciation for the Abraham Accords because 
        of the use of the term ``normalization agreements'' to refer to 
        the varied agreements Israel has concluded with its neighbors. 
        I recall discussing with colleagues the need to correct that 
        misperception in our public remarks. That was reflected in the 
        language used in a series of statements, op-ed pieces in 
        Washington and in the region, and events celebrating the one-
        year anniversary of the Abraham Accords, as well as working on 
        projects that could widen and deepen the Abraham Accords.

          Question. Regarding Spokesperson Price's April 1 press 
        briefing in which he said that the State Department ``call[s] 
        them normalization agreements'' not ``Abraham Accords'': did 
        you discuss that statement with anyone after the briefing in 
        any way (e.g. personally, phone, email, text, chat, etc.)? For 
        example, did you seek to determine whether that was actually 
        the State Department's policy, why it was the policy, who set 
        it, when it was set, and so on? If you did not, why not? If so, 
        please describe the exchanges.

          Answer. I recall engaging with colleagues around that time 
        about the need to correct the misperception that the 
        Administration did not support the Abraham Accords or wish to 
        refer to them as such.

          Question. Regarding Spokesperson Price's April 1 press 
        briefing in which he said that the State Department ``call[s] 
        them normalization agreements'' not ``Abraham Accords'': please 
        transmit any email or text threads in which you participated 
        about his statement.

          Answer. My search of my records has not produced any such 
        communications, though you would need to make requests for 
        Department records to the Department.

          Question. Regarding the Free Beacon June 4 story that cited 
        two emails instructing staffers to use ``normalization 
        agreements'' not ``Abraham Accords'': did you attempt to 
        determine whether the story was accurate? For example, did you 
        inquire if the emails existed, why they were sent, who sent 
        them, when they were sent, and so on? If you did not, why not? 
        If so, please describe the exchanges.

          Answer. I recall urging colleagues to find ways to correct 
        the misperception that the Administration did not appreciate 
        the Abraham Accords or wish to refer to them as such. I recall 
        pursuing if anyone had seen the emails referenced by the Free 
        Beacon, and I recall being told no. I also recall engaging with 
        staff about finding ways to widen and deepen the Abraham 
        Accords so that the signatories' relationships did not settle 
        into a ``cold peace,'' as had been the case for some of 
        Israel's other relationships. That effort to deepen and broaden 
        substantive cooperation included support for the ``I2U2'' 
        project between one of the Abraham Accords signatories--the 
        UAE--and Israel, India, and the United States. When Secretary 
        Blinken launched that effort, the Department's public statement 
        noted that, ``The Secretary reiterated the Biden 
        administration's support for the Abraham Accords and 
        normalization agreements and discussed future opportunities for 
        collaboration in the region and globally.''

          Question. Regarding the Free Beacon June 4 story that cited 
        two emails instructing staffers to use ``normalization 
        agreements'' not ``Abraham Accords'': did you ever attempt to 
        acquire or read the cited emails? If you did not, why not? If 
        so, please describe the steps you took to acquire or read the 
        cited emails.

          Answer. I recall pursuing at the time if anyone had seen 
        emails of this nature, and I recall colleagues saying that they 
        had not.

          Question. Regarding the Free Beacon June 4 story that cited 
        two emails instructing staffers to use ``normalization 
        agreements'' not ``Abraham Accords'': please transmit any email 
        or text threads in which you participated about the story.

          Answer. I have not found any emails or texts in my records 
        with regard to this story, and any request for Department 
        records will need to be addressed to the Department.

                                *  *  *

                   follow up questions submitted to 
                 joey r. hood by senator cruz--number 4
          Question. In the QFRs submitted pursuant to your nomination, 
        and again in follow up questions, I asked you about guidance 
        distributed within the State Department in early 2021 which 
        instructed staffers to no longer refer to the Abraham Accords 
        as ``Abraham Accords,'' but instead to call them 
        ``normalization agreements.'' The guidance was distributed on 
        February 4 in an email between press staffers with the 
        instruction ``we are no longer using 'Abraham Accords' to refer 
        to the normalization of relations between Israel and other 
        countries.'' On April 1 Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters 
        that the policy of the State Department was to call ``call them 
        normalization agreements.'' On June 4 the Washington Free 
        Beacon (WFB) confirmed the existence of the policy, citing 
        ``two internal State Department emails'' reviewed by the 
        outlet.
          During this time period, i.e. February 4 to June 4, you were 
        Acting Assistant Secretary for the Near Eastern Affairs Bureau 
        (NEA). I am seeking to clarify the degree to which you knew 
        about the existence of this policy and any actions you took 
        regarding it, or whether the policy had been set from within 
        your bureau and for the State Department without your 
        knowledge.
          You have confirmed that you eventually took responsibility 
        for the public controversy over the issue: you told reporters 
        in a non-public briefing on June 24 ``effectively to `blame the 
        misunderstanding on me as the Acting Assistant Secretary for 
        [NEA].''' Nevertheless, you have also replied that you were not 
        aware the guidance was issued on February 4, that you did not 
        ask Mr. Price specifically about his comments on April 1, and 
        that when you asked others whether they had seen the emails 
        referenced in the June 4 WFB story they told you no. You have 
        also said that you searched your digital records and found no 
        communications on these issues.
          Finally, you cited a statement by Sec. Blinken using the 
        phrase ``Abraham Accords'' from October 2021, well after the 
        policy had been publicly confirmed by the WFB and the State 
        Dept. moved to reverse it.
          More broadly, these statements are difficult to align with 
        the full public record.
          By March 11 Mr. Price was already referring to the Abraham 
        Accords as normalization agreements. Even the section in the 
        State Dept.'s official transcript for that day's press briefing 
        is labeled ``ISRAEL/NORMALIZATION AGREEMENTS''--




                  ``Question: My question is: What concretely are you 
                guys doing to expand the Abraham Accords? Are you 
                talking to Saudi Arabia, for example, about them 
                recognizing Israel? Could you tell us a little bit 
                about what concretely you're doing? Thank you.

                  ``Mr. Price. Absolutely. Well, when it comes to Prime 
                Minister Netanyahu's travel, we'd refer you to the 
                Government of Israel regarding his travel. As we have 
                said, as the Secretary said yesterday, we welcome, we 
                support the normalization agreements between Israel and 
                countries in the broader Muslim world. It is something 
                that we will seek to build on. It is something that we 
                have welcomed from the previous administration and 
                something, again, we will seek to build on going 
                forward. We have discussed it in the bilateral context 
                with some of our partners in the Arab and Muslim world. 
                It is something that we have discussed with the 
                Israelis. I wouldn't want to get ahead of where--of 
                private conversations at this point, but I expect 
                before too long, you will--we'll be in a position to 
                say more and you'll be in a position to see more about 
                how we are going to build on that.''




          On May 10 Mr. Price again pointedly and exclusively referred 
        to the Abraham Accords as normalization agreements--




                  ``Question: Right. Okay. So then let me ask something 
                on the Abraham Accords. Do you think it might actually 
                be counterproductive in that they make it easier for 
                the Israeli Government not to meet the aspirations of 
                Palestinian people for an independent state?

                  ``Mr. Price: The normalization agreements, and--is 
                something that we support. It is something that we 
                think is not only good for Israel, it is good for the 
                region. Improved ties between Israel and its Arab 
                neighbors is something that we will continue to support 
                in our diplomacy and engagement, both with the Israelis 
                and Arab states.

                  ``Question: But could it be counterproductive because 
                it doesn't actually give any leverage or any benefit to 
                the Palestinians?

                  ``Mr. Price: The normalization agreements are one 
                element of our engagement in the region. Of course, we 
                continue to engage in the context of a two-state 
                solution, and I think if you saw Jake Sullivan's 
                readout, if you've seen our recent statements, if you 
                were provided with call transcripts--most of which we 
                read out--you would see our emphasis on a two-state 
                solution. So we can do both. We can work to see 
                improved ties between Israel and its neighbors, just as 
                we work to forge some advance in the prospects of a 
                two-state solution.''




          On May 18, White House Spokesperson Jen Psaki said ``Aside 
        from putting forward a peace proposal that was dead on arrival, 
        we don't think they did anything constructive, really, to bring 
        an end to the longstanding conflict in the Middle East.''
          In a previous question, I asked you whether you discussed 
        with Mr. Price his April 1 statement about the Abraham Accords, 
        i.e. that the State Dept. ``call[s] them normalization 
        agreements.'' You said: ``I do not recall asking Mr. Price if 
        it was Department policy not to refer to the Abraham Accords as 
        such because I do not recall believing that this was Department 
        policy.'' You also said ``I recall discussing with Mr. Price 
        and others, however, that it was becoming clear--as evidenced 
        by the April 1 press briefing and the Washington Free Beacon 
        article--that there was some public misperception about the 
        Biden administration's appreciation for the Abraham Accords 
        because of the use of the term `normalization agreements'. I 
        recall discussing with colleagues the need to correct that 
        misperception in our public remarks.''
          I also asked you about any role played by then-Deputy 
        Assistant Secretary of State for Israel and Palestinian Affairs 
        Hady Amr in generating or clearing the guidance. Mr. Amr's 
        office oversaw this policy area and the State Dept. official 
        who issued the guidance was the press officer for Israel and 
        Palestinian Affairs. You suggested you have no knowledge of any 
        role he played.


     Was Mr. Amr one of the colleagues with whom you spoke regarding 
            what you describe as the need to correct misperceptions 
            ``because of the use of the term `normalization agreements' 
            ''? If so, please describe the nature of that discussion: 
            when did it happen, what was the topic, what was Mr. Amr's 
            reaction. If you did not discuss this topic with him, why 
            not?

          Answer. Yes, DAS Amr was one of the colleagues with whom I 
        spoke regarding the need to correct misperceptions about the 
        Administration's support of the Abraham Accords. I do not 
        recall the precise date of these discussions, as they would 
        have been part of our daily consultations, but I recall that 
        DAS Amr agreed with this need.

          Question. You replied to a previous question by saying you 
        discussed with Mr. Price the ``public misperception'' about the 
        Biden administration's stance on the Abraham Accords ``as 
        evidenced [inter alia] by the April 1 press briefing.'' Did 
        that discussion take place before or after his May 10 press 
        briefing, in which he again pointedly emphasized that the State 
        Dept. calls them ``normalization agreements''? If the 
        conversation happened before, why do you believe he 
        nevertheless reemphasized the position despite your concerns, 
        including in your capacity as Acting Assistant Secretary for 
        NEA? If the conversation happened was after the May 10 press 
        briefing, why did you wait as long as you did to have the 
        conversation?

          Answer. To the best of my recollection, this discussion took 
        place after the June 4 press briefing in Rome identified in 
        previous questions for the record. I regret that I did not act 
        faster and more decisively to help dispel the notion that the 
        Biden administration did not support the Abraham Accords.

          Question. You have testified that you did not know about the 
        February 4 email instructing public affairs staffers to call 
        the Abraham Accords ``normalization agreements.'' Do you 
        believe that it was inappropriate to clear or implement that 
        guidance without your awareness, in your capacity as Acting 
        Assistant Secretary for NEA?

          Answer. Yes. I believe such proposed guidance should also 
        have been discussed with our Charges d'Affaires in Abu Dhabi, 
        Manama, and Jerusalem, who told me that they never received 
        instructions not to refer to the Abraham Accords in public 
        exclusively as ``normalization agreements.''

          Question. Do you believe that the policy outlined in the 
        February 4 email, i.e. to refer to the Abraham Accords as 
        ``normalization agreements,'' was in the national security 
        interests of the United States? Please also describe any 
        effects that you believe it had on U.S. diplomacy more broadly.

          Answer. I do not believe it was Department policy to refer to 
        the Abraham Accords exclusively as ``normalization 
        agreements,'' although I am now aware that the aforementioned 
        press guidance shared between press officers existed. I do not 
        believe that press guidance constituted a policy decision, nor 
        do I believe that it was in the national security interests of 
        the United States because it contributed to confusion in some 
        quarters of the public regarding the Administration's support 
        for the Abraham Accords specifically.

          Question. It would have been relatively straightforward for 
        you to trace Mr. Price's public statements and comments. There 
        would have been language in his briefing book, email threads in 
        which State Dept. officials from your bureau cleared that 
        language, at least one specific list of officials clearing on 
        behalf of specific offices in your bureau, etc. Did you try to 
        obtain any of these materials? If you did not, why not? If you 
        did, did you succeed and if so please describe the materials.

          Answer. I did not seek these materials. Then-candidate Biden 
        expressed his support for the Abraham Accords when they were 
        signed and Secretary Blinken, as a nominee testifying before 
        the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also expressed the new 
        administration's support for the Abraham Accords (by name). For 
        me, those were the clearest expressions of Biden administration 
        policy with regard to the Abraham Accords. Once I became aware 
        of the public misperception of the Administration's support for 
        the Abraham Accords, I began discussing with colleagues the 
        need to address it, not only through public statements but also 
        through activities and initiatives that would provide a ``warm 
        peace'' for the people of the signatory countries. I believed 
        that this public misperception stemmed largely from the fact 
        that administration officials had stated that they were 
        conducting a review of the Abraham Accords, along with most 
        other policies in their first months in office. I recognize and 
        take responsibility for the confusion these discussions may 
        have contributed to in the early months of the Biden 
        administration; as Acting Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern 
        Affairs, I regret that I did not take more decisive action 
        earlier to clarify the Administration's support for the Abraham 
        Accords specifically, along with Israel's other current and 
        potential future diplomatic relationships.

          Question. Mr. Price pointedly and exclusively used 
        ``normalization agreements'' in his March 11 press briefing and 
        explicitly told reporters in his April 1 press briefing that 
        the State Dept. refers to the Abraham Accords as normalization 
        agreements. You have said that you did not believe that was the 
        State Dept.'s policy. What was the basis for your belief, i.e. 
        that he had repeatedly mischaracterized State Dept. policy? In 
        previous answers you have gestured toward presumably 
        contradictory statements made by other State Dept. officials. 
        To the extent that you believe they are relevant, please cite 
        them specifically.

          Answer. Among other public statements were the following: On 
        January 27, 2021 at a press availability, Secretary Blinken 
        said, ``First, as we've said, we very much support the Abraham 
        Accords. We think that Israel normalizing relations with its 
        neighbors and other countries in the region is a very positive 
        development, and so we applauded them, and we hope that there 
        may be an opportunity to build on them in the months and years 
        ahead.'' In a March 11, 2021 press briefing, the White House 
        Spokesperson referred to the Abraham Accords as such, noting 
        that the Administration was reviewing them. A June 9, 2021 
        joint statement on the eighth U.S.-UAE Economic Policy 
        Dialogue, in which I participated, noted that the two 
        delegations ``commended the historic signing of the Abraham 
        Accords in September 2020.''

          Question. At any time--after March 11, April 1, or May 10--
        what was your understanding regarding why Mr. Price kept 
        publicly telling journalists the opposite of what you 
        understood to be the State Dept.'s policy?

          Answer. My understanding is that Mr. Price was following 
        guidance offered by press officers that had not been reviewed 
        by me and that sought to be as inclusive as possible in 
        discussing Israel's past and potential future diplomatic 
        agreements with its Arab neighbors.

          Question. Regarding Mr. Price's May 10 press briefing, in 
        which he pointedly emphasized that the State Dept. refers to 
        the Abraham Accords as ``normalization agreements'': did you 
        discuss that statement with him after the briefing in any way 
        (e.g. personally, phone, email, text, chat, etc.)? For example, 
        did you ask him whether that was actually the State 
        Department's policy, why it was the policy, who set it, when it 
        was set, and so on? If you did not, why not? If so, please 
        describe the exchanges.

          Answer. I would note that on May 10, I was on a trip that 
        included stops in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and 
        Iraq. I do not recall watching this press briefing or hearing 
        about it from my staff. I do not recall asking Mr. Price if it 
        was Department policy not to refer to the Abraham Accords as 
        such because I do not recall believing that this was Department 
        policy, having witnessed the President, the Secretary, our 
        Charges d'Affaires in Jerusalem, Abu Dhabi, and Manama, as well 
        as other senior U.S. officials, refer to the Abraham Accords as 
        such. While I do not recall the date, I recall discussing with 
        Mr. Price and others that it was becoming clear--as evidenced 
        by the press briefing exchanges and the Washington Free Beacon 
        article--that there was some public misperception about the 
        Biden administration's appreciation for the Abraham Accords 
        because of the use of the term ``normalization agreements'' to 
        refer to the varied agreements Israel has concluded with its 
        neighbors. I recall discussing with colleagues the need to 
        correct that misperception in our public remarks and actions. 
        That was reflected in the language used in a series of 
        statements, op-ed pieces in Washington and in the region, and 
        events celebrating the one-year anniversary of the Abraham 
        Accords, as well as working on projects that could widen and 
        deepen the Abraham Accords. I certainly regret that I did not 
        act faster to help correct that public misperception, believing 
        as I did that initiatives to deepen the Abraham Accords, such 
        as the ``I2U2'' Ministerial and investment projects would send 
        powerful messages of support.

          Question. In your assessment, did Ms. Psaki's May 18 
        statement, i.e. ``Aside from putting forward a peace proposal 
        that was dead on arrival, we don't think [the Trump 
        administration] did anything constructive, really, to bring an 
        end to the longstanding conflict in the Middle East,'' 
        contribute to what you describe as the ``public misperception 
        about the Biden administration's appreciation for the Abraham 
        Accords.''

          Answer. Yes.

          Question. In your own assessment, is it accurate to assess 
        that aside from putting forward a peace proposal that was dead 
        on arrival the Trump administration didn't do anything 
        constructive to bring an end to the longstanding conflict in 
        the Middle East?

          Answer. As a member of the Foreign Service, I have served 
        under Democratic and Republican administrations. I proudly 
        served in the Trump administration as Deputy Chief of Mission 
        in Kuwait, as Deputy Chief of Mission and Charge d'Affaires in 
        Iraq, and as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State 
        under Assistant Secretary David Schenker in the Bureau of Near 
        Eastern Affairs. I believe that the Administration accomplished 
        a great deal in trying to bring an end to the longstanding 
        conflicts in the Middle East, including--inter alia--supporting 
        and facilitating the signing of the Abraham Accords, as well as 
        Morocco's re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel 
        and efforts to resolve the conflict over the region known as 
        the Western Sahara. I believe the Trump administration also 
        exerted constructive efforts in supporting the Iraqi Security 
        Forces, including the Iraqi Kurdistan Region's Peshmerga 
        forces, in liberating Iraqi territory from ISIS, as well as 
        helping communities targeted for genocide to recover. These 
        included Yezidis, Christians, and Muslims, both Sunni and Shia. 
        In my time under the last administration, I regularly 
        represented and defended the Trump administration's policies in 
        the Middle East, including on Capitol Hill. Thank you for the 
        opportunity to address this question.

                                *  *  *

                   follow up questions submitted to 
                 joey r. hood by senator cruz--number 5
          Question. In QFRs submitted pursuant to your nomination, and 
        again in follow up questions, I have been asking you about a 
        policy distributed by the Near Eastern Affairs Bureau (NEA) in 
        which State Dept. staffers were instructed not to refer to the 
        Abraham Accords as ``Abraham Accords,'' but instead to call 
        them ``normalization agreements.'' During the period this 
        guidance was in place you were Acting Assistant Secretary for 
        NEA. You have confirmed that on June 24 you told journalists, 
        not for publication, ``effectively to `blame the 
        misunderstanding on me as the Acting Assistant Secretary for 
        [NEA].' ''
          The policy was set around February 4, 2021, when instructions 
        to that effect were distributed. The policy lasted roughly 
        through June 4, when the Washington Free Beacon (WFB) confirmed 
        the instructions, citing ``two internal State Department 
        emails'' reviewed by the outlet. In between, Spokesperson Ned 
        Price publicly confirmed and followed the guidance: he referred 
        to the Abraham Accords as ``normalization agreements'' in press 
        briefings on March 11, April 1, and May 10, and during his 
        April 1 briefing he said the State Dept.'s policy regarding the 
        Abraham Accords was to ``call them normalization agreements.''
          As discussed in previous questions, this policy was both 
        consistently implemented and went through NEA. The February 4 
        email was distributed by Rachel Rubin, the press officer for 
        Israel and Palestinian Affairs. Language used by Mr. Price in 
        his press briefings would have been discussed over email 
        threads with NEA officials, and there would have been a list of 
        officials who cleared on behalf of NEA offices. Canned public 
        affairs guidance about the Middle East generated by NEA 
        followed the guidance. Other public affairs products regularly 
        cleared by NEA officials, including on behalf of NEA/FO, 
        exclusively used ``normalization agreements.'' The WFB story 
        indicated that the outlet asked for comments, and any response 
        would have been discussed with and cleared by NEA officials.
          Nevertheless--you have said you did not know any such policy 
        was in place. More specifically, you have said that you did not 
        know NEA distributed the email, that you don't recall seeing or 
        clearing any such guidance, that you asked staffers for details 
        about the relevant emails but they denied knowing about them, 
        that you did not call for any materials related to the language 
        Mr. Price was publicly using, that you did not ask him about 
        that language, that you did not watch or hear about at least 
        one of his press briefings about the issue, that you are not 
        aware of any role played by then-Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
        Israel and Palestinian Affairs Hady Amr in formulating or 
        clearing the instructions, and that you have no digital 
        communications about this controversy or about the guidance or 
        about the WFB story.
          You have said that you didn't ask for further details because 
        you didn't believe the guidance reflected the Biden 
        administration's policy toward the Abraham Accords, which you 
        have characterized as supportive. You have cited four 
        statements on this question. Three were outside the time the 
        guidance was seemingly in place, i.e. February 4 to June 4, and 
        a fourth was by White House Spokesperson Jen Psaki criticizing 
        the Accords. None are tenable examples of relevant supportive 
        language.
          You have also said that it was inappropriate to implement the 
        guidance without you clearing it, in your capacity as Acting 
        Assistant Secretary for NEA, and that the ``misunderstanding'' 
        undermined the perception of America's commitment to our Middle 
        East allies.
          I am deeply troubled by this breakdown in process and 
        substance, both because of what it suggests about the Biden 
        administration's policymaking regarding our Israeli allies, and 
        the degree to which it speaks to your nomination for Ambassador 
        to Tunisia, an extremely challenging post.


     In retrospect, what specific steps do you believe you should have 
            taken to avoid the breakdown, and why?

          Answer. I regret that I did not establish an internal policy 
        of reviewing all new press guidance to ensure that it fully and 
        accurately reflected the President's stated policy positions, 
        including support for the Abraham Accords, along with Israel's 
        agreements with its other Arab neighbors.

          Question. To what extent do you believe the breakdown is 
        relevant to broader organizational challenges within NEA, both 
        domestically and abroad at American embassies? What specific 
        steps do you believe need to be taken to avoid similar 
        incidents in the future?

          Answer. It is not unusual for press officers to offer 
        guidance that is not cleared at the highest levels of the 
        Bureau due to the need to respond to media inquiries quickly. 
        Having learned from this experience, in any future leadership 
        position in Washington or overseas, I will establish with my 
        staff an internal policy of personally reviewing any changes in 
        press guidance.

          Question. Please assess the damage to American national 
        interests caused by the belief that the Biden administration 
        had prohibited the use of ``Abraham Accords'' to refer to the 
        Abraham Accords?

          Answer. I do not assess there to have been damage to U.S. 
        national interests due to this misperception, primarily 
        because, fortunately, the President himself and the Secretary 
        of State were on record commending the historic nature of the 
        Abraham Accords and expressing the Biden administration's 
        support for them.

          Question. Do you believe that Ms. Rubin distributed the 
        guidance to use ``normalization agreements'' in place of 
        ``Abraham Accords'' without being instructed to do so, i.e. `on 
        her own'? If so, please explain why she did so. If not, to the 
        best of your current knowledge--

     Who instructed Ms. Rubin to distribute the guidance?

          Answer. To the best of my current knowledge and recollection, 
        and after conferring with colleagues in the NEA front office at 
        the time, I am not aware that anyone in the NEA front office 
        sent any instruction with regard to this press guidance.

          Question. Who cleared on Ms. Rubin distributing the guidance 
        to use ``normalization agreements'' in place of ``Abraham 
        Accords?''

          Answer. After conferring with colleagues in the NEA front 
        office at that time, I am not aware that anyone in the NEA 
        front office cleared on such guidance. NEA's press officers do 
        their best to provide press guidance as quickly as possible.

          Question. To the best of your current knowledge, who cleared 
        on the language that Mr. Price used in his press briefings, and 
        specifically his statement on April 1 that regarding the 
        Abraham Accords the State Dept. ``call[s] them normalization 
        agreements?''

          Answer. To the best of my knowledge, Spokesman Price's press 
        guidance relevant to countries in the NEA region is normally 
        drafted and sent to the spokesman by NEA press officers.

          Question. You have said that you spoke to Mr. Amr in broad 
        terms about the controversy and about emphasizing that the 
        Biden administration supported the Abraham Accords, and that he 
        was supportive. The stance is in tension with statements he 
        made before entering the Administration, in which he expressed 
        hostility toward the Trump administration's Middle East 
        peacemaking. It is also in tension with the contents of a memo 
        he drafted in late February, The U.S. Palestinian Reset and the 
        Path Forward, in which he called for re-centering the Israeli-
        Palestinian issue in the context of ``normalized relations'' 
        between our Israeli and Arab allies. Please describe the extent 
        to which Mr. Amr was supportive of the Abraham Accords.

          Answer. In all my conversations with DAS Amr, he expressed 
        support for strengthening the Abraham Accords, as well as 
        Israel's other agreements with Arab governments, and support 
        for negotiating new agreements between Israel and governments 
        of Muslim-majority countries.

                                       U.S. Senate,
                            Committee on Foreign Relations,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:04 a.m., in 
Room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Tim Kaine 
presiding.
    Present: Senators Kaine [presiding], Menendez, Booker,

              OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TIM KAINE,
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA

    Senator Kaine. Good morning to all. This hearing of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee will come to order.
    We are here to consider important ambassadorial nominees: 
William Duncan to be Ambassador to El Salvador; Hugo Rodriguez 
to be Ambassador to Nicaragua; Candace Bond to me Ambassador to 
Trinidad and Tobago; Heide Fulton to be Ambassador to Uruguay; 
and Robert Faucher--did I get that right, Robert?
    Mr. Faucher. That is correct.
    Senator Kaine. Robert Faucher to be Ambassador to Suriname.
    I want to congratulate all of you on your nominations and 
provide thanks to you and your--for your willingness to serve 
and thanks especially to members of your family because you 
cannot do one of these posts without them sacrificing.
    I will, first, introduce the nominees. Then I will offer 
opening remarks and turn to Ranking Member Rubio for opening 
remarks, and then we will then have opening statements from 
each of the nominees before proceeding to questions.
    William Duncan is senior inspector in the Office of the 
Inspector General at the Department of State, previously served 
as consul general in Monterrey and before that as DCM at the 
U.S. Embassy in Mexico City.
    Foreign Service Officer since 1992. Happy 20th anniversary. 
He also served in Asuncion, Madrid, Baghdad, Mexico City, 
Bogota, San Salvador, and Matamoros. A native of Louisiana, Mr. 
Duncan has a bachelor's degree and a juris doctorate from the 
University of Arkansas and is fluent in Spanish.
    Hugo Rodriguez, Jr., is a senior advisor in the Bureau of 
Western Hemisphere Affairs at State. He most recently served as 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemispheres, 
focused on Central America and Mexico. Previously, Mr. 
Rodriguez served as the DCM at the U.S. Embassy in Asuncion, 
Paraguay, and as consul general at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico 
City.
    Other overseas assignments include Lima, Peru, Rome, Italy. 
He is a native of Pennsylvania but, to my liking he holds an 
MBA from the Darden School of Business at the University of 
Virginia and a bachelor's degree from Hampden-Sydney College. 
He is fluent in Italian and Spanish.
    Candace Bond currently serves as the president and CEO of 
AESA, Inc., a Los Angeles-based real estate and community 
development business advisory services company. She is also a 
board member of California Head Start, the chair elect of the 
board of the Greater L.A. Education Foundation, and chair of 
the MLK Health and Wellness Community Development Corporation.
    She served on the board of the L.A. County Office of 
Education, the nation's largest regional educational agency. 
Ms. Bond also serves on the California State Treasurer's 
Housing, Economic Development, Jobs, and Opportunity Zone 
Committee. She graduated with both a bachelor's degree and an 
MBA from Harvard.
    Heide Fulton is the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for 
Western Hemisphere Programs in the Bureau of International 
Narcotics and Law Enforcement.
    She previously served as the director of the Office of 
Mexican Affairs, led the U.S. Embassy in Honduras as DCM and 
Charge d'Affaires. She served overseas in Kabul, Quito, Phnom 
Penh, and Manila and is a former Pearson Fellow, which is a 
prestigious fellowship of members of the State Department and 
Senate offices where she had the fortune to serve in the office 
of Senator Menendez.
    Ms. Fulton was also an active duty Army officer as a 
quartermaster with the U.S. Army in Virginia, Germany, 
Luxembourg, Netherlands, and Italy. She retired from the U.S. 
Army Reserve in June of 2020 after 28 years of service. She was 
born in Buffalo, a graduate of Boston College and Troy State 
University, and is fluent in Spanish.
    Finally, Robert Faucher most recently served as the 
principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Conflict 
and Stabilization Operations. Prior, he was director of the 
Office of Western European Affairs in the Bureau of European 
and Eurasian Affairs, and has held positions in the offices of 
U.N. Political Affairs and U.N. Specialized and Technical 
Agencies in the Bureau of International Organizational Affairs.
    Faucher has served as the DCM at U.S. embassies in Belgium, 
Ireland, Suriname, and Luxembourg. He grew up in Arizona, holds 
degrees from Arizona State University, Edinburg University, and 
the National War College, and he is fluent in Dutch and French.
    Very, very talented panel. So my remarks, I want to 
congratulate all of you on the nominations. Representing the 
U.S. and the American people in any capacity is an honor.
    To represent with the title of ambassador is a true, true 
distinction and I am sure, based on each of your impressive 
professional backgrounds, you will serve with real distinction 
in these roles.
    I am pleased to chair the nomination hearing for these five 
important posts throughout the Western Hemisphere--El Salvador, 
Nicaragua, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Suriname.
    I always talk about the importance of this region to the 
United States. Not only do we share deep and important 
cultural, historical, and economic ties, but we also have 
interests in addressing the shared challenges together with 
countries throughout the region. Having our best team in the 
field is absolutely critical to advancing those interests as 
well as our values in the Western Hemisphere.
    Our relations with Salvador are fragile. We have watched 
with growing concern as El Salvador's government has taken an 
increasingly authoritarian turn after a somewhat promising 
beginning with a government that was not connected with sort of 
past challenges in El Salvador.
    Having an ambassador in place to advance values and 
interests in El Salvador and continue our support for the 
Salvadoran people will be critical.
    In Nicaragua, the Ortega regime sham elections last year, 
including the imprisoning of many, many presidential candidates 
and their intensifying attacks against opposition figures or 
other critics including religious leaders--the order connected 
with Mother Teresa just got kicked out of Nicaragua by 
President Ortega--these are significant concerns.
    We need to continue pressing for the restoration of 
democratic rights in Nicaragua and work with regional and 
international partners to support the Nicaraguan people in 
finding a way forward.
    So, Mr. Rodriguez, you will have your work cut out for you 
and we look forward to hearing about your approach in Managua, 
should you be confirmed.
    In the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago share a commitment to 
democracy. They have remained a steadfast partner of the United 
States in the Caribbean. We have strong cultural ties, a 
vibrant diaspora community in the United States, and this 
August, Trinidad and Tobago will be celebrating 60 years of 
independence.
    Having a confirmed ambassador will send an important signal 
reaffirming our partnership with Trinidad and Tobago and, in 
particular, I will ask questions in this regard with respect to 
the ability of Trinidad and Tobago to be a force for energy 
security in a world where there is significant energy 
insecurity.
    Uruguay is considered one of the strongest democracies in 
the world and that fact deserves a lot more recognition in 
Washington and elsewhere. Uruguay seeks greater cooperation 
with the U.S.
    My view is that we should support that cooperation and I 
look forward to hearing from Ms. Fulton about how we can 
strengthen ties with this very important partner.
    Finally, Suriname's 2020 election of President Santokhi 
offers the potential to a new chapter in U.S. relations with 
Suriname following President Bouterse's decades-long rule which 
included his and his son's separate convictions as drug 
traffickers and his own conviction for the 1982 December 
murders in Suriname.
    Suriname, like Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana, also offer 
prospects for advancing energy security in the world and I 
would like to direct questions to Mr. Faucher about how we can 
work on that.
    So we look forward to hearing from each of you today. I 
look forward to working with you.
    And now I am proud to introduce the ranking member, Senator 
Rubio, who has been such a strong champion for U.S. relations 
in the Americas. I am very, very glad we have a chance to work 
together.
    Senator Rubio?

                STATEMENT OF HON. MARCO RUBIO, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA

    Senator Rubio. Mr. Chairman, thank you for scheduling this 
hearing, and you have been a great partner to work with on this 
and I appreciate and look forward to working with you on this.
    Again, I want to congratulate each of you for your 
willingness to serve. Thank you for your willingness to serve 
and congratulate you on your appointments and your nominations.
    And I guess I do not really have an opening statement. I do 
have sort of a mini rant to open, and it is not about any of 
you individually. It has more to do with our region.
    When I hear people talk about we need to care more about 
the Western Hemisphere, it is reminiscent of, like they say, 
you also need to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables. It is a 
good thing for you, it is good for your health, and you should 
really do it. But most of us never get around to it. Well, 
speaking for myself anyway.
    So the point being is this is not just a nice thing to do. 
It is critical to our national security and our national 
economic interests. Geography matters. It matters for a lot of 
different reasons and--but it matters because proximity 
matters.
    Because we see it firsthand. There is economic--look at the 
migrant crisis that we face on the border today. Those are all 
people coming from places where life is not good, and at the 
cornerstone of why life is not good in those countries--the 
violence, the economic deprivations, whatever it may be--is 
poor governance and bad decisions made over a sustained period 
of time.
    That alone is a national interest. But then not to mention 
we do have near peer adversaries. We did not 25 years ago. The 
United States lived in a unipolar world where we were the only 
show in town.
    Now there are at least one unprecedented near peer 
adversary. The Chinese Communist Party is a challenge to the 
United States, unlike--greater even though what the Soviet 
Union was because they are a commercial rival, a technological 
rival, a geopolitical rival, a diplomatic rival, and a 
commercial one.
    And in addition to all of that, they are also a military 
threat to the country as they continue to develop and have an 
interest in the region. They want to extract minerals and have 
mineral rights, certainly.
    But they also want leverage. They want control over 
countries so that they will vote with them in international 
fora and, ultimately, so they could potentially position 
themselves either on a rotational basis or permanently all over 
the world militarily and the like.
    In essence, they would love nothing more than to encircle 
the United States and to have--put themselves in a position in 
each of the countries, for example, that all of you have been 
nominated to serve in but, more broadly, in the region.
    They want to be in a position one day to, no matter who 
gets elected in those countries, do whatever they want because 
that country owes them too much money and they own too many 
things in that country to break away from it.
    And so that is the fundamental challenge that all of you 
are walking into, and in the context of that is how I think we 
need to guide our foreign policy and so I hope we will have a 
chance to talk about that today.
    If you go through some of the countries highlighted here in 
today's hearing, in Uruguay we have a president who has been 
trying to work with the United States on things like reducing 
barriers to trade.
    But, unfortunately, because we do not have a strategic 
approach to that relationship--this is not a partisan attack. I 
think you can say that of virtually any administration in the 
last 30 years.
    Because we do not have a well thought out and executed a 
strategic approach to the region you have someone who, 
basically, feels like his only options for development are to 
cut a deal with the Chinese Communist Party--do a deal with the 
devil in that regard.
    In Suriname, you have a president who is struggling to 
manage more than a billion dollars in Chinese debt that he--
that his predecessor took on, and we have this administration 
that has the single-minded focus on climate change and, 
therefore, does not seem interested in helping them develop 
markets and/or their capabilities because it happens to be oil 
and gas.
    And in El Salvador we have a very interesting situation. On 
the one hand, we have seen some of the--obviously, there has 
been economic chaos, some of the internal political things.
    I am not a big fan of everything that has been done there. 
But I am--I also think it is a relationship that it is 
important for us to manage appropriately, and, you know, our 
charge, I believe, has left post and sort of announced some 
strategic pause in efforts to reach out to them.
    So as we talk about going there, Mr. Duncan, you are--it is 
a very, very challenging situation and one that I would love to 
hear your thoughts as to what the road forward is because I am 
hoping that we can still have a relationship in El Salvador 
that is pragmatic.
    We do not have to clap or celebrate all the stuff people do 
that we do not necessarily think is good. But I also think we 
have a national interest concern there that needs to be 
balanced.
    In Trinidad and Tobago, the prime minister, unfortunately, 
continues to be a supporter of the Maduro regime and it is 
signing agreements to join the Belt and Road Initiative of the 
Communist Party.
    Nicaragua is a horrific disaster. I think it is the second 
poorest country in the hemisphere. But more importantly and 
just as important is the--I mean, this is a country where the 
president arrested every one of his political opponents. If you 
ran for president you went to jail.
    I mean, that is--I mean, not even Putin, everybody. He at 
least has an official opposition. Here, this is--it is pretty 
stunning the direction that has taken, and even more troubling 
is they have now rolled out the red carpet. It is an open 
invitation for both Chinese and Russian military stationing in 
the region.
    I think the Russians have their hands full right now but 
you could see a presence there. But the Chinese may one day 
take them up on it and that would be--I mean, if we wake up in 
a world where the Chinese have a military basing arrangement in 
our own hemisphere it would be a very troubling turn in 
regional affairs and one that, I think, is a threat that we 
cannot overlook.
    So all of these places we are facing some real challenges 
and I am hopeful that we will be able to talk about those 
today.
    Again, I am grateful for your willingness to serve. But we 
have got big problems on our hands in this region and we better 
start taking it seriously or we are going to wake up in less 
than a decade living in a very different world than the one we 
live in now and the one we grew up in.
    Thank you.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Senator.
    So there is an embarrassment of riches. I have already done 
introductions, but for Ms. Bond you have got a second 
introducer that is even better and that is Senator Booker.
    After he does an introduction of you we will go, beginning 
with Mr. Duncan and move from my right to left, and each of you 
will do your opening statements, if you could.
    Senator Booker?

               STATEMENT OF HON. CORY A. BOOKER,
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY

    Senator Booker. Mr. President, I cannot tell you how 
great----
    Senator Kaine [continuing]. Mr. President? I really love 
that.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. You will always be my president, sir.
    Senator Kaine. Because I was Lieutenant Governor of 
Virginia and president of the Senate. That has been a title 
that has been applied to me in that August.
    Senator Rubio. But you were referred to as Your Excellency 
in that role.
    Senator Kaine. No. As Governor I was your Excellency. As 
Lieutenant Governor I was Mr. President.
    Senator Booker. Mr. Grand----
    Senator Kaine [continuing]. Virginia does things 
differently.
    Senator Booker. Mr. Grand Poobah.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. I cannot tell you how thrilled I am that I 
get this privilege to introduce somebody that I have known for 
some years now, and I wonder, Mr. President, if you know what 
an Alaskan sled dog, a worker bee in the spring, and an Olympic 
athlete all have in common. They are all jealous of Ms. Bond's 
work ethic.
    She is an extraordinary person and, in fact, if James Brown 
was the hardest person--working person in show business, she is 
one of the hardest working people I have ever met in public 
service.
    She brings a long and distinguished record of leadership to 
this position. She is chair of the Malibu Foundation, board 
member of the Women's Founders Network and a member of the 
Southern California Edison Clean Energy Access Working Group.
    She also serves on the California State Treasurer's 
Housing, Economic Development, Jobs, and Opportunity Zones Ad 
Hoc Committee. Earlier in her career, she was president--a 
title that has eluded us, all of us here--and CEO of Infusion 
Media Partners and serves as both VP and general manager of 
Essence Entertainment, which is--has biblical importance to the 
Black community.
    Her wide-ranging business background, her commitment to 
effecting meaningful, substantive, thorough social change is 
just awesome. She has experience addressing a host of critical 
issues for the larger American community from health, housing, 
education, workforce development, and is, for all of those 
reasons, an extraordinarily well qualified person to be 
Ambassador of Trinidad and Tobago.
    If there is any criticism I have, and I should lay that 
plain on the table, is that her education is one of two safety 
schools. She has her BA from Harvard and her MBA from Harvard 
Business School.
    But despite that blemish, she is a recipient of numerous 
awards of leadership from her peers, awards of leadership and 
service, including the Women Leaders of Los Angeles 2021 award 
selected by the Los Angeles County Office of Education, the 
Women of Distinction award by the Special Network of Needs, 
just to name a few.
    Presently, she serves as a board member of California Head 
Start, a program and organization very dear to me. She is chair 
elect of the board of the Greater LA Education Foundation and 
chair of the MLK Health and Wellness Community Development 
Foundation.
    Ms. Bond also served on the board of the Los Angeles County 
Office of Education, the nation's largest regional education 
agency.
    Look, I am confident that her distinguished record of 
leadership, of service, of love of country and patriotism 
demonstrated by action will make her a great Ambassador to 
Trinidad and Tobago.
    And then, finally, I will say all my Trinidadian friends 
have told me throughout the years that the best carnival all 
throughout the Caribbean is in Trinidad.
    Well, I do not know what kind of celebration they will have 
in the future but I know that when this incredible person is 
confirmed as Ambassador, we, in the Senate, should have a 
carnival to celebrate that good and wise choice.
    Thank you.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Senator Booker.
    Ms. Bond, he set a pretty high bar. You better be good.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Kaine. But now what we will do is we will begin 
with Mr. Duncan. Your full statements are in the record. We 
would ask you to keep your verbal statement to less than five 
minutes. We are glad to hear from all of you and we will just 
move right to left--from my right to left across the dais.
    Mr. Duncan, welcome.

STATEMENT OF WILLIAM H. DUNCAN OF TEXAS, A CAREER MEMBER OF THE 
SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-COUNSELOR, NOMINATED 
   TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE 
    UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR

    Mr. Duncan. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and distinguished 
members of the committee, it is an honor to appear before you 
today as the President's nominee to be the next United States 
Ambassador to the Republic of El Salvador.
    I deeply appreciate the privilege and responsibility it is 
to be considered for confirmation as Ambassador. I deeply 
respect the role of the Senate and the work of ensuring that 
our nation has a foreign policy that reflects our values.
    Please allow me to recognize my wife, Nora, who is with me 
today, and our daughters, Clare, Irma Nora, and Laura, and our 
grandson, Ace.
    Let me also thank President Biden and Secretary Blinken for 
this opportunity and for their confidence in me.
    My 30-year Foreign Service career has taken me to many 
countries, including El Salvador, also Mexico, Colombia, 
Paraguay, among others, as well as many domestic assignments 
working on Western Hemisphere affairs.
    It has also given me the opportunity to work in service of 
U.S. policy supporting democracy, human rights, and the rule of 
law.
    The relationship between El Salvador and the United States 
has been very close for the last four decades, through a 
terrible civil war, a complex peace process, and into today's 
challenges such as fighting transnational organized crime and 
promoting prosperity.
    The United States has stood with El Salvador, and over 
those years many Salvadorans have become our fellow citizens. 
Two and a half million Salvadorans now live here. They make an 
enormous contribution to our national story through their 
extraordinary creativity and work ethic, and to El Salvador 
through billions of dollars in remittances returned each year.
    I started my Foreign Service career at a consulate on the 
U.S.-Mexico border. I learned there that there is no higher 
duty for us than the protection of American citizens. If 
confirmed, that would be my number-one priority.
    We face a serious challenge from irregular migration from 
northern Central America, some of it from El Salvador. During 
many years in Mexico, I had the opportunity to learn what it 
means to make that trek.
    One thing is clear to me. It is a dangerous journey 
undertaken by desperate people. I know from living there that 
Salvadorans are proud. If they could make a better, safer, and 
more stable life in El Salvador, I believe most would choose to 
stay.
    If confirmed, I would do everything in my power to see that 
the assistance provided by Congress to address the root causes 
of irregular migration is spent effectively, and while we are 
not the only country offering assistance, we are notable for 
supporting and promoting the long-term well-being of our 
partners as opposed to seeking our own short-term advantage.
    El Salvador has no better friend than the United States of 
America. I recognize there are concerns about the strength and 
direction of El Salvador's democracy, and while I will always 
act with respect for the sovereignty and dignity of the 
government of El Salvador, if confirmed, I would be an advocate 
for democracy, human rights, and combating corruption and 
impunity.
    These are not only moral imperatives, they are the best 
guarantee for the long-term stability and prosperity of any 
country. No country in the Western Hemisphere can alone 
successfully confront transnational organized crime. We must 
work together.
    Strengthening the rule of law in El Salvador is essential 
if we are going to discourage irregular migration. Without the 
rule of law, El Salvador will never have the economic growth it 
needs nor will it be able to prevent human rights abuses and 
attacks on civil liberties, reduce gender-based violence, or 
defeat the threat from criminal gangs, all drivers of irregular 
migration.
    Promoting the interest of U.S. businesses in El Salvador 
would also be a priority if I am confirmed. It is important to 
prosperity here at home, but I am also convinced U.S. 
businesses at their best set an example of transparency and 
fair dealing that will be emulated.
    I have had the honor to serve in challenging leadership 
positions such as Deputy Chief of Mission in Mexico City. In 
that tour of duty and others, I was fortunate to work with the 
representatives of many U.S. Government agencies.
    If confirmed, I would dedicate myself to the success of 
each U.S. agency's mission in El Salvador.
    I have also had the honor to work with fellow Americans and 
foreign national employees from a wide variety of backgrounds. 
We are a diverse nation and should have an overseas presence 
that proudly respects that diversity.
    I look forward to this opportunity to advance America's 
interest in El Salvador, if confirmed, and I stand ready to 
answer any questions you may have today and in the future.
    Thank you.

STATEMENT OF HUGO F. RODRIGUEZ, JR., OF PENNSYLVANIA, A CAREER 
    MEMBER OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-
    COUNSELOR, NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND 
PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC 
                          OF NICARAGUA

    Mr. Rodriguez. Good morning.
    Chairman Kaine, Ranking Member Rubio, distinguished members 
of the committee, it is an honor to appear before you today as 
President Biden's nominee to serve as the next United States 
Ambassador to Nicaragua.
    I am grateful to President Biden and Secretary Blinken for 
their trust and confidence in me and, if confirmed, I look 
forward to working with you and your colleagues in Congress to 
advance the interests of the United States in Nicaragua.
    Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to thank my 
parents, Gail and Hugo Rodriguez, Sr., my five brothers and 
sisters, my teachers and professors, and my State Department 
colleagues. I have learned from them all the value of hard 
work, especially in service to others, and the importance of 
listening deeply before speaking.
    I want to thank my daughters, Alison and Annalia, for 
making our peripatetic life richer and more meaningful, hardly 
ever complaining about our many moves and long working hours.
    And most of all, I want to thank my wife and fellow Foreign 
Service Officer, Karen Rodriguez. This career has been a team 
effort and I owe anything I have achieved to Karen's 
enthusiastic support, her wise counsel, and her enduring 
willingness to shoulder more than her share of the home burden 
in addition to her day job. She inspires me every day.
    In 1958, my father left the Dominican Republic, fleeing a 
dictatorship that allowed average Dominicans no space for 
freedom and no hope of achieving their dreams.
    Unfortunately, Nicaraguans now face a similar situation 
since last November's election when Daniel Ortega and Rosario 
Murillo deprived Nicaraguans of any real choice and 
Nicaraguans' hopes for democracy and prosperity were dashed.
    More than 180 political prisoners, including political 
opposition figures, human rights defenders, student leaders, 
journalists, religious groups, and civil society 
representatives remain behind bars, deprived of their human 
rights.
    The Nicaraguan government also closed civic space at an 
alarming rate, shuttering more than 700 associations, 
universities, foundations, and other nonprofits in 2022 alone.
    As a result of the escalating climate of repression, fear, 
and hopelessness, along with the Ortega-Murillo government's 
failure to address people's basic needs, hundreds of thousands 
of Nicaraguans are now refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants 
throughout the region.
    The United States has spoken out against these abuses and, 
if confirmed, I will continue to do so, not because we have any 
intention of meddling in Nicaragua's internal affairs but 
because it is our commitment under the Inter-American 
Democratic Charter, which both the United States and Nicaragua 
signed in 2001.
    As President Biden has stated, the Inter-American 
Democratic Charter obligates the hemisphere to stand up for the 
democratic rights of the Nicaraguan people.
    If confirmed, I commit to working with Congress, 
interagency colleagues, and international partners to press for 
a return to democracy, respect for human rights, and the 
immediate release of all political prisoners in Nicaragua.
    While we fundamentally disagree with the actions of the 
Ortega-Murillo government, the relationship between our two 
countries goes much deeper than political leadership.
    More than 400,000 people of Nicaraguan descent live in the 
United States. Around 6,000 Americans visit Nicaragua each year 
and another 20,000 reside there.
    The United States has long supported economic development 
throughout Central America and a prosperous, stable, and 
democratic Central America is, clearly, in our interest.
    That is why, if confirmed, I will engage with voices across 
Nicaraguan society to share our vision of inclusive economic 
growth, as stated by the President at the recent Summit of the 
Americas in Los Angeles.
    We will look to support civil society groups that provide 
essential services in the areas of health care, education, and 
poverty relief, including organizations the Nicaraguan 
government has targeted.
    We will do what we can to offer the Nicaraguan people a 
better future in their own country. We know that addressing the 
root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement 
throughout Central America and including Nicaragua involves 
ensuring respect for human rights, generating economic 
opportunity, and improving citizen security. These improvements 
require governments to uphold the rule of law and combat 
corruption.
    If confirmed, I will advocate for a change of course so 
that the Nicaraguan people may work to recover their democracy, 
provide for their families, and regain hope for their future.
    Mr. Chair, Ranking Member, and committee members, I thank 
you again for your consideration of my nomination and I welcome 
your questions.

   STATEMENT OF CANDACE A. BOND OF MISSOURI, NOMINATED TO BE 
  AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED 
    STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

    Ms. Bond. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Rubio, 
and distinguished members of the committee. It is my honor to 
appear as President Biden's nominee for U.S. Ambassador to the 
Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.
    I am proud to have my husband, Steve McKeever, our 
daughter, Maddox, and my brother, Les Bond, Jr., here today. 
They have been constantly supportive through this process. I am 
also thankful for the love and support of my son, mother, and 
many family members who are watching this hearing.
    Our family represents a proud line of Black educators, 
professionals, and community leaders. Descended from slaves, 
our family has made meaningful contributions to the fabric of 
our nation. Ours is a very American story.
    My mother, Anita Bond, was the first Black female graduate 
from St. Louis University. She graduated magna cum laude and 
she recently received her honorary doctorate. She also served 
as president of the St. Louis School Board and on President 
Lyndon Johnson's Civil Rights Commission.
    My late father, Dr. Les Bond, was a prominent physician, 
surgeon, and community leader and was appointed to the St. 
Louis Board of Police Commissioners.
    Other prominent members of our family, including Julian 
Bond, former NAACP chairman, were passionate about improving 
the quality of life for their communities. Theirs are the 
shoulders on which I proudly stand. I have sought to apply my 
abilities to devise solutions that lift people up, strengthen 
communities, and inspire sustainable change.
    After completing my graduate education, I held senior 
executive positions at leading cultural, media, and 
entertainment companies. At AESA, Inc., I advised public and 
private entities in areas of social impact, community and 
business development.
    I played a key role in advancing transformational 
infrastructure and commercial projects that served my 
community. I also worked to improve our public education system 
for over 2 million families as an official for the Los Angeles 
County Office of Education.
    As chair of the MLK Community Development Corporation, I am 
working to improve health equity and access to care for 
underserved populations.
    Additionally, I have fought to ensure that no community is 
left out of our clean energy future, representing small 
businesses and environmental groups on California's utility 
consumer advisory panel.
    The values instilled in me by my family and my experiences 
as a business and community leader have equipped me to advance 
the common interests of the United States in Trinidad and 
Tobago as Ambassador.
    As a specialist in building strong public-private 
partnerships, I understand the value of good governance and 
promoting equitable economic prosperity and ensuring that 
democracies can meet the needs of and deliver for their people.
    If confirmed as an ambassador, I will work to promote 
accountability and transparency and combat corruption, which 
not only helps improve overall climate for foreign direct 
investment and trade but also enables inclusive and sustainable 
economic growth for all citizens.
    As the U.S. looks to partner with countries to reduce 
climate impacts and bolster energy security, Trinidad and 
Tobago is well positioned to help speed the development of 
clean energy infrastructure and climate adaptation projects in 
the region.
    While natural gas remains a cornerstone of Trinidad and 
Tobago's economy, it is looking ahead towards diversifying its 
energy resources. Through support for improved access to 
financing and technical assistance, the U.S. can help spur 
Trinidad and Tobago's transition to a sustainable and resilient 
economy.
    Of course, my greatest responsibility, if confirmed, will 
be ensuring the safety and security of the 13,000 American 
citizens living in Trinidad and Tobago, and the thousands more 
who visit each year for business and tourism.
    Keeping Americans safe also requires the diligent 
implementation of Caribbean Basin Security Initiative-funded 
citizen security programs that work to prevent gang violence, 
reduce violent crime, and strengthen Trinidad and Tobago's 
judicial system.
    Trinidad and Tobago is a regional leader on security and a 
partner in the fight against transnational organized crime. I 
look forward to working with the government of Trinidad and 
Tobago and international partners to help better support 
vulnerable populations, including victims of human trafficking 
as well as Venezuelan migrants and refugees.
    I hope to work together with this committee to address 
pressing diplomatic matters in Trinidad and Tobago and the 
broader region.
    I am humbled by the honorable mission President Biden, Vice 
President Harris, and Secretary Blinken have asked me to take 
on as Ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago, and if confirmed, I 
pledge to dedicate my skills and energy to strengthen our 
diplomatic and economic ties to Trinidad and Tobago to advance 
U.S. interests in the world and to promote American democratic 
values.
    I am happy to answer any questions that the committee may 
have and I look forward to working with you, if confirmed.

                 Prepared Statement of Candace A. Bond

    Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and distinguished 
members of the committee. It is my honor to appear as President Biden's 
nominee for U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.
    I am proud to have my husband, Steve McKeever, our daughter, Maddox 
and my brother, Les Bond Jr. here today. They have been constantly 
supportive through this process, and I am thankful for the love and 
support of my son, mother, and many family members who are watching 
this hearing.
    Our family represents a proud line of Black educators, 
professionals, and community leaders. Descended from slaves, our family 
has made meaningful contributions to the fabric of our nation. Ours is 
a very American story.
    My mother Anita Bond was the first Black female student to graduate 
magna cum laude from Saint Louis University where she recently received 
her honorary doctorate. She also served as president of the St. Louis 
School Board and on President Lyndon Johnson's Civil Rights Commission. 
My late father Dr. Les Bond was a prominent physician, surgeon, and 
community leader and was appointed to the St. Louis Board of Police 
Commissioners. Other prominent members of our family, including Julian 
Bond, former NAACP Chairman, were passionate about improving the 
quality of life for their communities. Theirs are the shoulders on 
which I proudly stand. I have sought to apply my abilities to devise 
solutions that lift people up, strengthen communities, and inspire 
sustainable change.
    After completing my graduate education, I held senior executive 
positions at leading cultural media and entertainment companies. At 
AESA, Inc. I advised public and private entities in the areas of social 
impact, community, and business development. I played a key role in 
advancing transformational infrastructure and commercial projects that 
served my community. I also worked to improve our public education 
system for over two million families as an official for the Los Angeles 
County Office of Education. As chair of the MLK Community Development 
Corporation, I am working to improve health equity, access to care for 
underserved populations. Additionally, I have fought to ensure that no 
community is left out of our clean energy future, representing small 
businesses and environmental groups on California's utility consumer 
advisory panel. The values instilled in me by my family and my 
experiences as a business and community leader have equipped me to 
advance the common interests of the United States and Trinidad and 
Tobago as ambassador.
    As a specialist in building strong public-private partnerships, I 
understand the value of good governance in promoting equitable economic 
prosperity and ensuring that democracies can meet the needs of and 
deliver for their people. If confirmed as ambassador, I will work to 
promote accountability and transparency, and combat corruption, which 
not only helps improve the overall climate for foreign direct 
investment and trade but also enables inclusive and sustainable 
economic growth for all citizens.
    As the United States looks to partner with countries to reduce 
climate impacts and bolster energy security, Trinidad and Tobago is 
well-positioned to help speed the development of clean energy 
infrastructure and climate adaptation projects in the region. While 
natural gas remains a cornerstone of Trinidad and Tobago's economy, it 
is looking ahead toward diversifying its energy resources. Through 
support for improved access to financing and technical assistance, the 
United States can help spur Trinidad and Tobago's transition to a 
sustainable and resilient economy.
    Of course, my greatest responsibility if confirmed will be ensuring 
the safety and security of the 13,000 American citizens living in 
Trinidad and Tobago and the thousands more who visit each year for 
business and tourism. Keeping Americans safe also requires the diligent 
implementation of Caribbean Basin Security Initiative-funded citizen 
safety programs that work to prevent gang violence, reduce violent 
crime, and strengthen Trinidad and Tobago's judicial system.
    Trinidad and Tobago is a regional leader on security and a partner 
in the fight against transnational organized crime. I look forward to 
working with the Government of Trinidad and Tobago and international 
partners to help better support vulnerable populations, including 
victims of human trafficking as well as Venezuelan migrants and 
refugees. I hope to work together with this committee to address 
pressing diplomatic matters in Trinidad and Tobago and the broader 
region.
    I am humbled by the honorable mission President Biden, Vice 
President Harris, and Secretary Blinken have asked me to take on as 
Ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago. If confirmed, I pledge to dedicate 
my skills and energy to strengthen our diplomatic and economic ties to 
Trinidad and Tobago, to advance U.S. interests in the world, and to 
promote American democratic values. I am happy to answer any questions 
the committee may have.


    Senator Kaine. Thanks so much.
    Ms. Fulton?

STATEMENT OF HEIDE B. FULTON OF WEST VIRGINIA, A CAREER MEMBER 
  OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-COUNSELOR, 
NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF 
   THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE ORIENTAL REPUBLIC OF 
                            URUGUAY

    Ms. Fulton. Chairman Kaine, Ranking Member Rubio, members 
of the committee, it is an honor to be here today as President 
Biden's nominee to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to the 
Oriental Republic of Uruguay.
    I am humbled by the trust and confidence that President 
Biden and Secretary of State Blinken have shown by putting my 
name forward for consideration at this pivotal moment in our 
bilateral relationship and, if confirmed, look forward to 
working with you and your teams to enhance the opportunities 
presented before us.
    I am grateful for the support of my family, including my 
husband, James Fulton, a Foreign Service specialist and retired 
Army Special Forces Officer, and our two children, Anam-Cara 
and Cormac Fulton.
    I would also like to thank my parents, Bob and Gretchen 
Bronke, who have instilled in me the values of hard work, 
dedication, and integrity, which they have modeled throughout 
their lives. I regret that travel and work commitments have 
prevented any of them from joining me but I am very happy to 
have the support of a longtime friend and Senate staffer, 
Barbara Prior, with me today.
    Throughout my career at the State Department, I have led 
complex organizations and negotiated large-scale initiatives. 
This includes my present position as the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary in the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law 
Enforcement where I oversee Western Hemisphere programs and our 
aviation portfolio.
    In this capacity, I oversee more than $2 billion of 
programming in 28 countries. I have hands-on experience 
combating corruption, strengthening the civilian law 
enforcement capacity of our partners, shaping our rule of law 
programs throughout the hemisphere, and fighting to stem the 
flow of synthetic drugs and other narcotics that have killed 
more than 100,000 Americans over this past year.
    I helped to shape the Bicentennial Framework with Mexico, 
which reset and rejuvenated our security cooperation with this 
key partner.
    I led the U.S. mission in Honduras during a tumultuous 
period of contested 2017 national elections where I protected 
U.S. interests and preserved our strategic objectives.
    I have drawn on my formation of 28 years as an Army officer 
and 25 years as a public diplomacy practitioner to forge strong 
relationships based on open communication and mutual 
understanding. These have been hallmarks of my career.
    If confirmed, I look forward to working closely with you 
and this committee and others in Congress to use these skills 
to enhance our robust bilateral relationship with Uruguay and 
to advance the interests and security of the American people.
    This will include significant focus in three areas: 
enhancing economic ties between our nations, working with 
Uruguay as a democratic leader in the hemisphere, and 
strengthening the position of the United States as one of 
Uruguay's key diplomatic partners.
    Uruguay is a valued partner in the Western Hemisphere. With 
its large middle class, strong history of democratic values, 
and dedicated engagement in multilateral organizations, Uruguay 
is one of the most economically and politically stable 
countries in Latin America.
    Uruguay has spoken out strongly against Russia's illegal 
invasion of Ukraine and democratic backsliding in the region, 
in addition to welcoming more than 20,000 refugees fleeing the 
dictatorship in Venezuela.
    Uruguay has historically played a key role in global 
peacekeeping efforts as one of the world's top troop 
contributing nations per capita.
    Uruguay is recognized as a global leader in its use of 
renewable energy sources, and we are expanding our joint 
efforts towards more sustainable agriculture.
    If confirmed as Ambassador, I will work diligently to 
strengthen cooperation with the government of Uruguay and 
international organizations to combat transnational criminal 
organizations and all forms of trafficking.
    The United States is one of Uruguay's largest trading 
partners and an important investor. If confirmed, I will seek 
to deepen economic ties and develop new business opportunities 
in Uruguay on behalf of U.S. companies.
    As Uruguay prepares to implement its 5G networks, I will 
also, if confirmed, encourage Uruguay to embrace the principles 
of competition and technology neutrality while prioritizing 
security, resilience, and innovation.
    In closing, I look forward to working closely with you and 
your teams and other relevant stakeholders to advance our 
national security interests, to maintain a strong relationship 
with Uruguay, and to support continued cooperation on defending 
democratic institutions in the region.
    I think that we have tremendous opportunities with the 
Oriental Republic of Uruguay, a country with an outsized 
influence in the region.
    Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, members of the committee, 
it is an honor to be here before you and I look forward to your 
questions.
    Thank you.

    The United States is one of Uruguay's largest trading partners and 
an important investor. The United States buys over 70 percent of 
Uruguay's services exports, estimated at a value of $1 billion. The IT 
and software sector is booming, creating increased opportunity for U.S. 
investment, which is mutually beneficial. If confirmed, I will seek to 
deepen economic ties and develop new business opportunities in Uruguay 
on behalf of U.S. companies. As Uruguay prepares to implement its 5G

    Senator Kaine. Thank you so much.
    And, finally, Mr. Faucher?

 STATEMENT OF ROBERT J. FAUCHER OF ARIZONA, A CAREER MEMBER OF 
   THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-COUNSELOR, 
NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF 
    THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF SURINAME

    Mr. Faucher. Thank you. Good morning.
    Chairman Kaine, Ranking Member Rubio, distinguished members 
of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear 
before you as President Biden's nominee to be the next U.S. 
Ambassador to the Republic of Suriname.
    I want to thank President Biden and Secretary Blinken for 
their confidence in me and I look forward, if I am confirmed, 
to working with Congress to advance U.S. interests in Suriname 
and the Caribbean region.
    Before I start, I would like to introduce today my wife, 
Noraly, who is here with me today. Noraly has been a source of 
inspiration, strength, and wisdom throughout our years together 
and I owe much to her.
    I would also like to express my profound thanks to my 
daughters, Stephanie and Melissa, who cannot be here but are 
watching from Rotterdam. I would like to recognize them for 
their repeated personal sacrifices as they, too, have proudly 
served our nation as representatives abroad.
    Suriname is a peaceful young democracy that is among the 
most ethnically and religiously diverse countries in the world. 
Although not well known in the United States, Suriname's roots 
are intertwined with our nation's founding through English 
colonization in the early 17th century.
    With the 1667 Peace of Breda, the Netherlands traded its 
New York colonies, including Manhattan, for the English colony 
of Suriname. This was later followed by the establishment of 
Maroon communities in Suriname's interior alongside indigenous 
Amerindian communities.
    In addition, enslaved Africans were freed in 1863 and 
contract laborers were recruited from China, India, and Java. 
As a result, Suriname enjoys a rich ethnic mosaic. It is a 
nation where Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and 
indigenous religions live peacefully and productively together.
    Since independence in 1975, Suriname has strengthened its 
democratic institutions and traditions. Reinforcing democracy 
and promoting respect for human rights and the rule of law are 
fundamental to U.S. relations with Suriname.
    If confirmed, I will vigorously continue these efforts and 
will support civil society and independent media and human 
rights defenders, who play a critical role in these efforts.
    Suriname was once one of the more isolated countries in the 
Western Hemisphere. It increasingly serves as a crucial nexus 
among South America, the Caribbean, and the transatlantic 
world. Suriname is a key U.S. partner in the region and the 
well-being of the United States is connected to Suriname 
through ties of commerce and geography.
    Decades of diplomatic relations between our two countries 
have developed strong economic and security partnerships. If 
confirmed, I commit to deepen our mutually beneficial economic, 
security, and democracy partnerships.
    Suriname also has tremendous development potential and, if 
confirmed, I will work with the Surinamese government to 
develop opportunities for economic growth and increased trade 
and assist its economic recovery following the COVID-19 
pandemic.
    As the biggest exporter to Suriname and its third largest 
importer, the United States provides critical high value 
materials for Suriname's economy.
    Our partnership looks likely to expand as major offshore 
oil reserves have been discovered, explored, and secured by 
American companies. The massive new oil wealth will transform 
Suriname and, if confirmed, I will deepen our economic and 
commercial relationship to advance both Surinamese and American 
prosperity and equitable economic growth, mindful of the threat 
of corruption.
    Suriname is also emerging as a global leader on the climate 
crisis response. More than 93 percent of the land surface in 
Suriname is covered by protected native forests. It is one of 
the few carbon negative countries in the world.
    Yet, problems persist. The gold fields of Suriname have 
drawn U.S. companies and the U.S. Government is supporting 
efforts to curb illicit mining and deforestation and the use of 
mercury, all of which gravely damage Suriname's environment.
    If confirmed, I look forward to partnering with Suriname to 
support its efforts to expand its positive environmental 
record.
    Suriname seeks greater military and law enforcement 
cooperation with the United States. It is a key member of the 
Caribbean Basin Security Initiative and partners with us in 
combating narcotics and human trafficking, and if confirmed, I 
will work to bolster Suriname's security capabilities, fight 
corruption, and strengthen our security and law enforcement 
cooperation.
    Finally, our embassy in Paramaribo has an exceptional team 
that works hard to advance bilateral relations, protect U.S. 
citizens abroad, and work with the government of Suriname to 
accomplish our foreign policy goals. Ensuring it is safe, 
secure, and well-resourced will be a top priority for me if I 
am confirmed.
    Thank you for your consideration of my nomination and I 
look forward to answering your questions.

    Senator Kaine. Thank you so much to all the witnesses.
    Before we begin five-minute rounds of questions, I do have 
a few questions to ask each of you. This is an important part 
of the hearing and it is designed to make sure that you will 
all be responsive to this committee, should you be confirmed.
    In these questions I am going to ask I would ask each of 
you to provide just a yes or no answer.
    First, do you each agree to appear before this committee 
and make officials from your office available to the committee 
and designated staff when invited?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    Senator Kaine. Do you commit to keep this committee fully 
and currently informed about the activities under your purview?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    Senator Kaine. Do you commit to engaging in meaningful 
consultation while policies are being developed, not just 
providing notification after the fact?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    Senator Kaine. Do you commit to promptly responding to 
requests for briefing and information requested by the 
committee and its designated staff?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    Senator Kaine. Thank you very much.
    We will now begin five-minute rounds of questions.
    I will start with you, Mr. Rodriguez.
    What a difficult time in Nicaragua and what a difficult 
post to which you have been nominated. I attended the Summit of 
the Americas in Los Angeles in June and it was interesting.
    There was quite a flap, as you know, about who should be 
invited to the summit, and a number of the nations in the 
Americas were critical of the United States for not having a 
full invitation of all countries in the hemisphere.
    As I was speaking to some of those leaders who were 
critical--some chose not to attend, some attended and were 
critical--it was interesting, they complained to me about the 
fact that Cuba and Venezuela had not been invited. No one 
complained that Nicaragua had not been invited, and I found 
that interesting.
    And when I asked them, hey, you have talked about Cuba and 
Venezuela but you have not mentioned Nicaragua, even those who 
strongly believe that Cuba and Venezuela should have been 
invited pretty much said Nicaragua was a disaster.
    We have got no--we cannot, with a straight face, make an 
argument that a president who imprisoned all of his rivals and 
has installed his wife as vice president and is throwing Mother 
Teresa and other--Mother Teresa's organization and others out 
of the country--we cannot with a straight face claim that they 
should have been invited to the summit.
    So what a difficult, difficult time. What space for U.S. 
sort of pro-democracy pro-human rights activity or support for 
organizations that are engaged in pro-human rights activity, 
what space exists within Nicaragua that you could promote, 
should you be confirmed?
    Mr. Rodriguez. Thank you, Senator.
    You are exactly right. It has really been a really 
lamentable turn of events, really, since 2018 in Nicaragua.
    The space has been increasingly limited. However, we still 
maintain a strong and well-led USAID contingent in country, 
working with those human rights defenders and other NGOs that 
continue to operate in country and increasingly working with 
those who are operating or directing operations from outside of 
the country.
    So those spaces still exist and, if confirmed, I look 
forward to redoubling our efforts to make sure that those 
voices are able to be heard across Nicaragua and across the 
region.
    You mentioned the opinion that our neighboring countries 
across the region have for Daniel Ortega and for the, really, 
terrible undemocratic turn the country has taken.
    That is a huge opportunity for us. Bringing that opinion 
forward from our neighbors in the region, elevating that 
sentiment, elevating those voices, has a big effect, not just 
across Nicaragua but also on the government of Nicaragua.
    They are increasingly becoming a pariah state within the 
region and I think we need to focus on bringing along that 
regional support to help raise that additional voice and those 
additional pressures on the government of Nicaragua.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you very much.
    I want to turn now to Mr. Faucher and Ms. Bond.
    Three nations in the region the democracy trend is in the 
right direction and they have significant energy resources at a 
time when there is global energy insecurity--Guyana, Suriname, 
Trinidad and Tobago.
    Senator Rubio and I just had a meeting with the president 
of Guyana, President Ali, right before this hearing began. He 
was in our office and it was a productive visit.
    Guyana had a proposal on the table for an IDB loan to 
develop their natural resources. The U.S. vetoed the loan in 
March. The IDB would not provide the $180 billion loan to allow 
Guyana to develop their energy resources and it was the U.S. 
that vetoed it.
    I am really struck by an incoherence in this 
administration's sort of energy policy. So there is three 
goals. We want to battle climate change. We want to help 
nations who are allies wean themselves away from dictators in 
terms of getting energy supply.
    We also have an interest in any country with whom we have 
an alliance to help them develop their economies in a positive 
way to produce economic activity that can help their people.
    I am very confused at the message that the Administration 
is sending on energy policy. Vetoing an IDB loan for Guyana but 
encouraging Saudi Arabia to pump more oil to help our allies, 
often canceling U.S. domestic oil leases at the same time as we 
are trying to help our allies wean themselves away from Russian 
energy.
    I do not expect you to solve these three goals and 
harmonize them. But what I have been waiting for is the 
Administration putting some policy on the table that expresses 
how they are trying to harmonize these goals.
    In particular, what might you do, should you be confirmed--
and I will begin with you, Mr. Faucher--what might you do to 
help Suriname or Trinidad and Tobago appropriately develop 
their energy resources, guarding against corruption and some of 
the other issues?
    Because, look, if we are going to veto loans to nations 
like Guyana, China is just going to step in and do those 
loans--I mean, let us not kid ourselves here--and then we end 
up losing influence with nations that would rather partner with 
the United States.
    What can you do, should you be confirmed, to help advance 
appropriate development of these nations' economies?
    Mr. Faucher. Mr. Senator, thank you very much for that 
question.
    This is really one of the critical issues in front of us 
right now as we look for Suriname's continued forward 
development of its democracy, its human rights structures, as 
well as its economy.
    Suriname is sitting on vast oil reserves, as we understand 
it, off its coast and American companies have been involved in 
developing and extracting that oil wealth. They have done this 
without support from the United States government.
    They have not asked for our support, as I understand it, 
nor has, if I am aware of it, Suriname asked for any kind of 
loans through the IDB or other organizations of that nature.
    My role, if I am confirmed as Ambassador, is to ensure that 
American companies can continue to compete for those oil 
licenses and contracts in the region and make sure that there 
is a fair and level playing field for that form of competition 
so that they do not lose out to countries like the PRC and 
others who might then be able to influence Suriname in negative 
ways.
    I would note, however, that Suriname's move toward 
democracy predates the discovery of oil off its shores and it 
has been making the right steps in that.
    And if I am confirmed as Ambassador, I will continue to 
support and work with the Surinamese government to ensure that 
it continues its economic and development as a democracy.
    Thank you.
    Senator Kaine. With the sufferance of my colleagues, I am 
over time but I would like to give Ms. Bond the chance to 
briefly answer the question as well.
    Ms. Bond. Yes. This is an important issue that came up in 
the Summit of the Americas, and the Vice President brought 
forth a new U.S.-Caribbean initiative that would really look at 
energy security and the development of three specific areas and 
taking a regional approach as opposed to an individualized 
country approach focused on energy security, focused on food 
security as well as finance.
     What we are really looking for is to leverage that 
opportunity and to look at long-term sustainable growth and 
focus in these areas, working on a regional basis as opposed to 
an individual basis.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you so much.
    Senator Rubio?
    Senator Rubio. Thank you, again, all for coming in.
    Let me start with you, Mr. Faucher. I am just going to go 
down the row here, if I can, in the time I am allotted.
    We have talked about energy, the role that it plays, its 
development when it comes to Suriname, its importance, and so I 
did want to ask, there is a--the President has an executive 
order and it tasks the Treasury and the State Department to 
develop a strategy to only support financing programs and 
stimulus packages and debt relief initiatives that are aligned 
with and support the goals of the Paris Agreement.
    And, I mean, it has already had an impact on an IDB 
decision with regards to Guyana, but I am real concerned about 
how that would impact the ability of U.S. companies and us to 
continue to encourage the development, even as we want them to 
diversify in their economy and we want to support them in that.
    I mean, why--are we here--does that executive order hold 
the potential of being viewed as us telling the people of 
Suriname that they cannot develop an advanced and modern 
economy because it clashes with our support of the Paris 
Agreement?
    Mr. Faucher. Thank you, Mr. Senator, for that question. It 
is a very important issue that we talked a little bit about 
this morning.
    I would say if American companies come to me, if I am 
confirmed as Ambassador, and ask for assistance in dealing with 
the Surinamese government on oil issues or oil commercial 
contracts, I will have to look at each case individually to 
make sure that the assistance I am able to give them conforms 
with any executive order that is delivered by the President.
    I am unaware of any kind of a push at all or statements by 
us that we do not want Suriname to develop its oil reserves or 
move forward and improve its economy. I think there is a 
recognition that there will be a need for oil for the decades 
ahead even though we are trying to diversify energy resources 
throughout the world.
    Suriname, as I stated in my statement, is a carbon negative 
country. It is meeting its requirements under the Paris Accord 
at this time and I think it is committed to continuing to do 
so.
    And so I will work with Suriname to make sure it also meets 
its environmental----
    Senator Rubio. Again, and when you have an executive order 
that, basically, asks Treasury and the State Department to 
structure financing programs and stimulus work and debt relief 
initiatives to be aligned to the climate agreement, there is 
the real concern--I think, the legitimate concern--that that 
would impact our ability to be of assistance in anything that 
has to do with oil and natural gas exploration, and we will see 
how that plays out. I hope that is not the case because I think 
that would negatively impact our relationship.
    Ms. Fulton, on Uruguay, I have talked about a couple--I 
think it is the first in the ranking by Freedom House and the 
World Justice Project in terms of democracy and rule of law, 
and as they are looking to revise the Trade and Investment 
Framework Agreement with the U.S.--I am sorry, in their new 
trade protocols that mirror what we have done with Brazil and 
Ecuador--it is clear that they are eager to establish even more 
transparency measures and anti-corruption measures.
    So I have outlined a couple things, I think, we can do to 
really strengthen this relationship. We have a willing partner 
and a stable country. There are a lot of good news coming out.
    Unfortunately, I will tell you, for a while, they think we 
are not--we do not care, like we are not paying attention to 
them and that we are not--we are ignoring. It is one of those 
countries that says, we are doing everything right. We are 
everything you say that you want countries in the region to be 
but we are not getting the attention we want.
    I have talked about a couple things that we should do. The 
first is expanding the Development Finance Corporation's role 
in facilitating investment there. The problem we have is they 
are classified by the World Bank as a high-tech country, and so 
the World Bank sort of prevents us.
    But I think that is one of those things that requires us to 
go back and reexamine how that is used and I really hope that 
we will look for ways to restructure that program so that 
countries like this, the country that JPMorgan, by the way, 
says is the least risky country in Latin America for 
investment, that the existence--that we are not prevented to 
DFC's facilitating programs there.
    And then the other thing, I think there is a real 
opportunity to expand cooperation on security space and 
counternarcotics, and cooperation with them on space and 
satellite data sharing, for example, would help us crack down 
on the black market that now exists in data.
    Are those two things that you would commit to exploring 
and, perhaps, pushing forward?
    Ms. Fulton. Absolutely. Thank you, Senator.
    I agree with what you are saying and would be, if 
confirmed, looking forward to finding opportunities to working 
with you and your team to see how we can rethink some of the 
impediments that currently prevent us from expanding our 
cooperation and seeking additional tools to enhance these areas 
of opportunity.
    Senator Rubio. Before I run out of time here, Mr. 
Rodriguez, the CAFTA is an agreement--preferential trade 
arrangement--among free nations.
    Is Nicaragua a free nation? And if they are not then what 
is the--should we continue to provide the preferential trade 
benefits that CAFTA provides to free nations?
    I mean, the point of it was to encourage the opposite of 
everything that Ortega and his crazy wife, who is the vice 
president, are doing.
    Mr. Rodriguez. Thank you, Senator Rubio.
    Let me just say, if confirmed, I would support using all 
economic and diplomatic tools to bring about a change in 
direction in Nicaragua.
    Removing Nicaragua from CAFTA-DR is a, potentially, very 
powerful tool and something we have to seriously consider. I 
know we currently exclude Nicaragua from supporting functions 
under CAFTA-DR--trade development capacity[CE3] building 
activities, and the like.
    But if confirmed, I commit to working with USTR and other 
agencies within the U.S. Government to evaluate all possible 
means for bringing that pressure to bear on Nicaragua.
    Senator Rubio. Mr. Duncan, real quick. I am already over 
time by a minute, but I did want to touch on El Salvador. It is 
a difficult puzzle to unpack.
    Certainly, the trend lines there in terms of President 
Bukele's view of the United States deteriorated rapidly in the 
last couple of years to the point now where it is now a really 
troubling situation.
    I am very troubled by it, and he did not seem to care a lot 
about what U.S. foreign policy is with regards to the country, 
very openly criticizes and mocks the U.S. and other Western 
institutions.
    And the reality of it is that, despite all this, we have to 
contend with the fact that his popularity remains pretty high 
and his party has enjoyed electoral gains as a result.
    So for whatever reason he is tapping into some populist 
sentiment in the country that is converting itself into 
political support and that, I think, gives him license, at 
least domestically, to continue down this trend line.
    But there is an interesting dynamic. On the one hand, we 
are carrying out this name and shame campaign from Washington 
where we are sanctioning individuals and calling them out for 
their alleged corruption and behavior and the like, and on the 
other hand you see them negotiating with the IMF where we are 
the leading contributor towards, and it seems like the--our 
administration is holding open the possibility that there would 
still be an IMF arrangement, I would imagine, because the 
understanding that if we did not there could be a mass 
migration event that would impact neighboring countries and/or 
they could turn to alternative means of financing outside of 
the structured system that the United States has influence 
over.
    How do we balance our national interest and desire to have 
not just stability there but some relationship with this 
campaign that is being carried out to--that, I think, has led 
to pretty open diplomatic hostility?
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you for the question, Senator.
    I think, first and foremost, we have to approach the 
Salvadoran government as we should most governments, from a 
position of respect and acknowledge, as you said, that they 
choose their own leaders and it appears that their current 
president is, indeed, at this point, very popular. That is a 
reality and we must recognize that.
    However, I think it is also true, as you indicated in your 
opening statement, that there have been some developments in El 
Salvador that do not seem to be conducive to strengthening 
Salvadoran democracy and there have also been some economic 
trends that are somewhat concerning.
    With respect to the sanctions you referenced, I think it is 
important for us to use the tools Congress has given us, 
whether that is Global Magnitsky or the Section 353 list or 
Section 7031(c)--to use those tools appropriately to target 
individuals who have been involved in acts of corruption or 
acts that undermine democracy or the rule of law, and I think 
we can do that while continuing to maintain a respectful 
relationship with the government of El Salvador. I do not see 
any inconsistency there.
    With respect to the IMF negotiations, which you mentioned, 
I am not up to date on exactly where those negotiations are. I 
believe they are still talking to the IMF.
    I know the IMF has publicly expressed some concerns that 
they, as I understand it, want to see satisfied before they 
move forward with that loan. So as far as I know, no final 
decision on that has been made.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you so much.
    Senator Menendez?
    The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I want to thank you and the ranking member for holding this 
hearing.
    As the chairman of the full committee, I appreciate that 
chairs and rankings who preside over nomination hearings is one 
of the fundamental responsibilities that we have to move 
nominees forward and I appreciate those of my colleagues who 
have fulfilled that duty during this work period.
    Congratulations to all the nominees and your families who 
are with you. This hearing comes at a time when human rights 
and fundamental freedoms face numerous challenges in our 
hemisphere, and champions of democracy are needed now more than 
ever.
    In Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega has become what he once fought 
to overthrow--a ruthless dictator. His disdain for democracy 
and decency are a test to the international community as we 
confront the rising global tide of authoritarianism.
    In El Salvador, President Bukele is wielding populism and 
new digital tools to perpetuate a cult of personality even as 
he undermines El Salvador's democratic institutions at an 
alarming rate.
    If confirmed, the leadership of each of the nominees here 
today will be indispensable to confronting the challenges in 
forging new opportunities for the United States and Latin 
America and the Caribbean.
    Let me take a point of personal privilege to briefly 
recognize Deputy Assistant Secretary Heide Fulton.
    Ms. Fulton was a Pearson Fellow in my office from 2009 to 
2010. The contributions she made during her time with us, 
including helping draft the first version of what would later 
become the OAS Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 that came 
into law, were a testament to her decades of experience in 
Latin America and the Caribbean.
    I would like to take credit that all of the successes she 
has had since then as a result of her time with me, but it is 
her incredible abilities and we are glad to see her being 
considered for the Ambassador to Uruguay.
    Mr. Rodriguez, Nicaragua has been in a state of crisis 
since April 18th of 2018. That was the day the anti-government 
protests triggered a years-long wave of repression that has 
killed 329 people, injured thousands, and condemned 190 
political prisoners to arbitrary detention in conditions 
amounting to torture.
    The Ortega regime has no shame. They have jailed, expelled, 
harassed political opponents, former lawyers, business 
partners, representatives of the Catholic Church.
    They have shuttered organizations that feed and shelter 
Nicaraguans. They have closed eight of the country's 
universities. They have attempted to withdraw from the 
Organization of American States all while cozying up to Russia. 
They have even kicked out Mother Teresa's Missionaries of 
Charity.
    Nicaragua is on the path to becoming a totalitarian 
dictatorship. We often talk about how to respond to crises 
instead of investing more in prevention. Our RENACER Act, which 
was signed into law last year, lays out a framework for U.S. 
policy, but we need to act now.
    So if you are confirmed, what steps would you take to 
mobilize a robust international strategy to prevent the onset 
of a deeper humanitarian crisis in Nicaragua?
    Mr. Rodriguez. Thank you, Senator.
    If confirmed, as you point out, we really need to mobilize 
voices from across the region and around the world to call out 
the human rights abuses, to call out the undemocratic actions 
that the government of Daniel Ortega is taking, and we need to 
call for the immediate release of the 190 political prisoners 
that you mentioned.
    If confirmed, I commit to working with U.N. Human Rights 
Council, OAS--excuse me--our partners in Europe and Canada, to 
seek their voice and their action in the form of sanctions, to 
join our efforts to highlight the abuses, and to isolate the 
regime of Daniel Ortega.
    The Chairman. Let me follow up with something that Senator 
Rubio raised. Our RENACER Act lays out congressional guidance 
on suspending Nicaragua from the CAFTA-DR trade agreement, and 
I know it is a powerful tool. Same thing with El Salvador.
    But we entered into these agreements with a universal 
concept of who we were entering into. Nicaragua, certainly, 
does not fall in that category at this point in time.
    What steps will you take to implement what the law says and 
do you commit to keeping this committee informed on a quarterly 
basis on the nature of Russia's deepening cooperation with 
Nicaragua?
    Mr. Rodriguez. Yes, Senator.
    I commit to keeping the committee informed. In addition, if 
confirmed, sir, I commit to adding my weight to the full 
implementation of the RENACER Act, as I mentioned, working with 
USTR and others on the CAFTA-DR question, continuing to 
implement the Act in terms of holding officials in Nicaragua 
accountable for the human rights abuses.
    We recently sanctioned another 23 individuals under Section 
353 thanks to the RENACER Act. That is a new capacity that we 
have and we are taking full advantage of it.
    Again, Senator, if confirmed, I will work with our 
interagency colleagues to maximize the pressure both through 
RENACER and all of the tools that the Senate can----
    The Chairman. I look forward to that. We need a strong 
voice there.
    Mr. Chairman, may I have the indulgence of the chair for 
another minute?
    Senator Kaine. Yes, you may.
    The Chairman. Mr. Duncan, I was a little surprised at your 
response to Senator Rubio about President Bukele's popularity. 
Hitler was popular. Putin is popular in Russia. It does not 
mean that because a person is popular in their country that, in 
fact, we do not press extremely hard on violations of human 
rights and democracy.
    Are we agreed on that?
    Mr. Duncan. We are, indeed, agreed on that, Senator.
    The Chairman. Okay. So we have an increasing challenging 
situation in El Salvador, one that threatens both the future of 
democracy in the country and bilateral relations with the 
United States.
    Over the last two years, President Bukele has presided over 
a number of alarming setbacks for democratic governance: 
undermining judicial independence, intimidating opposition 
lawmakers by using security forces to occupy the legislature, 
negotiating political pacts with gangs, regularly attacking 
journalists and media outlets.
    And in addition to these actions, Bukele has also 
repeatedly used his network of Twitter trolls to attack and 
threaten not only government critics within El Salvador but 
also United States officials, including my colleague in the 
House of Representatives, Congresswoman Norma Torres.
    It is amazing what he is doing, directing against a member 
of the United States Congress and former Ambassador Jean Manes.
    So I want to hear from you. Do you commit to prioritizing 
these issues in discussions with President Bukele and senior 
officials within his government?
    Mr. Duncan. Yes, Senator, I do make that commitment to you, 
and I must tell you that I think the exchange with--regarding 
Representative Torres was absolutely unacceptable and I would, 
certainly, be happy to make that clear to the Salvadoran 
government.
    The Chairman. What other steps do you believe the United 
States needs to take to prevent further democratic backsliding 
in El Salvador?
    Mr. Duncan. Senator, I think, first of all, I agree with 
you. There have been a number of developments in El Salvador 
over the last two years that are concerning when it comes to 
the strength and the health of El Salvador's democracy.
    I think we have made judicious use of the various sanctions 
tools that Congress has given us to highlight some of those 
problems, whether it is the removal of the supreme court 
magistrates in the constitutional chamber, the gang truce that 
you referred to, or other acts of either corruption or acts 
that tend to undermine democracy, and I think we need to 
continue using those tools appropriately, judiciously. But we 
need to keep using them to send the message that El Salvador's 
best future lies on the path of democracy.
    The Chairman. All right.
    Mr. Chairman, thank you for your indulgence and I will have 
a series of questions for the record. I do not want the rest of 
you to think I have no issues for you. I do.
    But in deference to my colleagues who are still here, I 
would like substantive--substantive underlined here--responses 
to them before I consider putting you on a business meeting 
agenda.
    Thank you very much.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you so much.
    Senator Portman?
    Senator Portman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, 
Mr. Chairman.
    Look, it is a complicated political environment and I 
really appreciate all of you being willing to step up and serve 
your country. For all of you but one you have been serving your 
country through Foreign Service and have accomplished a great 
deal to get to the level that that you are as ambassadors.
    But we need your help. I mean, this is discouraging what is 
going on, Uruguay being the exception, and to the comments by 
Senator Rubio, I think we do not take advantage of these 
relatively pro-democracy pro-U.S. center and center right 
governments enough and do not show them enough love and 
support, and that is one reason we end up with more difficult 
situations, as we see in pretty much every other country 
represented, even with regard to Suriname with regard to their 
opening to China, which concerns me greatly, and the Belt and 
Road Initiative.
    So that would be--I would echo those concerns and I think 
we need to redouble our efforts to demonstrate our support for 
those countries that are standing up for democracy, human 
rights, and allied with us.
    With regard to El Salvador, I am going to come at this a 
little differently. On the U.S. border, we are experiencing 
something unparalleled. We have never seen it before.
    We have record levels of people, drugs, coming across the 
border. We have got three months left in the fiscal year until 
we know what the final numbers are. Already we are at record 
levels in the year in the history of our country, and this is 
based on so-called encounters.
    But it is true that El Salvador has been sending people to 
the United States for a long time, legally and illegally. In 
fact, I am told that $7 billion in remittances went to El 
Salvador last year. That is the World Bank figure. That is a 
quarter of the GDP of El Salvador.
    And yet, you have Bukele treating the United States 
relationship in a way that would indicate that he does not want 
to cooperate or work with us and yet there is this strong 
connection. I do not know quite how to use that leverage. But 
$7 billion in remittances.
    One question I would have for you, Mr. Duncan, because you 
have been at this a while--you have got a lot of experience in 
Latin America--Title 42 is about to be revoked if the 
Administration has its way and, roughly, half of the people who 
are stopped at the border and turn back are turned back because 
of Title 42. And yet, we have record levels of illegal 
migration.
    So without Title 42 being in place it would be a flood and 
that is because of our asylum policy, in my view, primarily but 
it is also other changes that the Administration made.
    What do you think about that? Do you think human smugglers 
and drug cartels will in come from Salvador in increased 
numbers if Title 42 is revoked at the border?
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you for the question, Senator.
    I am afraid I cannot speak to what the effect of a 
revocation of Title 42 would be.
    Senator Portman. I think you can.
    Mr. Duncan. Nor can I tell you because I am not involved in 
the conversations about Title 42. What I can say is that, as 
you correctly pointed out, we have been seeing irregular 
migration from Central America.
    El Salvador is a part of that. I think they, in the last 
year or so, have been in fourth place, about 6 percent of the 
total behind Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala.
    I think if I were confirmed I would be very focused on 
implementing the Administration's strategy with regard to the 
root causes of migration. I think democracy needs to be 
strengthened in El Salvador because I think that is critical to 
prosperity.
    I think we need to keep working with the Salvadorans to 
strengthen the rule of law and try and reduce crime and 
violence.
    Senator Portman. Yeah, I am just talking--let me interrupt 
you if I could.
    I mean, that is fine. We have spent, I do not know, $3.6 
billion in the last five years in Central America with regard 
to the root causes and the migration has increased, not 
decreased.
    So I am not against dealing with the root causes. But that 
is not the issue. The issue is the pull factor. We went to 
Latin America, some of us here, including the chairman 
recently, and the presidents of the countries we visited--four 
of them--in Latin America and Central America all said the same 
thing, basically, which is you guys are pulling our people 
north with your policies.
    So you have a role to play there. You say you cannot speak 
to it. I hope you will speak to it because I think our own 
policies are, largely, the reason that you see this pull for 
the region. And the illicit drugs are not produced in El 
Salvador but, boy, it is a major transit country for cocaine 
and heroin, in particular.
    So I hope that, if confirmed, you will get involved in 
these issues and not just the root causes, as important as they 
are.
    The Salvadoran cooperation on counterdrug and anti-gang 
efforts, I assume you are aware that we do not get the 
cooperation that we would like to have.
    Do you commit that you will work on increasing our level of 
cooperation in that area?
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you, Senator. Yes, absolutely.
    Counternarcotics has been one of the areas where we have 
had some success in our collaboration with the Salvadorans and, 
if confirmed, I would seek to do everything in my power to 
increase that collaboration.
    We have also worked with them and are working with them, I 
should say, on border intelligence, on alien smuggling. I think 
those are areas that can even be expanded and that is what I 
would seek to do, if confirmed.
    Senator Portman. I will have other questions in writing for 
your other colleagues. But, again, thank you all for your 
willingness to serve.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Senator Portman.
    Senator Hagerty?
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and 
congratulations to all of our nominees who are here today. I 
can think of no greater honor than to represent the greatest 
nation in the world in the countries that you are seeking to 
represent the United States of America.
    I would like to start with you, Ms. Bond, on the first 
question to talk about the Chinese Communist Party and its 
interference, its malign influence, in the Western Hemisphere 
has grown significantly. Clearly, it has become more visible in 
the past decade.
    Beijing is using its predatory economic behavior to target 
the region for its commodities and its raw materials. That is 
the target. I believe we should be doing everything we can to 
reshore our supply chains back to the United States from China 
and, as appropriate, to near shore supply chains to friendly 
countries like those in the Caribbean and in Latin America.
    Efforts to support private sector investments in emerging 
markets are especially critical at this time of strategic 
global competition with China, and as the United States 
reshores its supply chains this will create big near shoring 
opportunities for our friends in this hemisphere.
    So I wanted to get your perspective, Ms. Bond, on China's 
diplomatic and economic engagement in Trinidad and Tobago and 
how you see that unfolding and the posture you might adopt 
there.
    Ms. Bond. Thank you, Senator, for that question.
    Indeed, PRC incursions are happening all over the world and 
the Caribbean is no exception, nor is Trinidad and Tobago. They 
were one of the first to join the Road and Belt Initiative.
    However, if confirmed as Ambassador, I will do everything 
in my power to ensure that we are positioned to be the partner 
of choice to Trinidad and Tobago.
    I would be a strong advocate for private sector investment 
and continue our strong working relationship with Trinidad and 
Tobago, particularly in safety and security and creating a more 
level playing field for private investment and U.S. investment 
in the country.
    The United States has been and continues to be one of 
Trinidad and Tobago's largest markets for LNG exports. It is 
seventh in the world in terms of LNG exports and it has one of 
the largest gas liquefaction facilities in the Western 
Hemisphere with a great deal of institutional knowledge, which 
I think they can share regionally.
    It is also one of the top exporters of urea ammonium 
nitrate fertilizer and just last week the U.S. International 
Trade Commission approved the import of this fertilizer, which 
you know will address issues of agricultural production----
    Senator Hagerty. Certainly.
    Ms. Bond.--as well as assist with global food supplies.
    So, if confirmed, these are areas that I would continue to 
work on and continue to bolster trade with the United States 
and our partners.
    Senator Hagerty. I encourage you to continue to support 
stronger energy production here in this hemisphere. We are 
doing everything in this country to reduce energy production 
right now, much to my chagrin, but I see the opportunity there 
and I am very pleased to see that you see it as well.
    In my home state agriculture is a big industry and 
pharmaceutical--I am sorry, fertilizer prices are a huge issue 
as well, compressing margins for farmers and leading to what I 
think will be a food crisis not only here in America but around 
the world.
    So thank you for your diligence there and I will encourage 
you to cooperate and coordinate with us here as we begin to 
deepen our reshoring efforts because I do believe this is a big 
opportunity in the country that you seek to represent.
    Mr. Rodriguez, can I turn to you? If you are confirmed, you 
are going to be taking on a challenging assignment in the 
Western Hemisphere.
    Both the Trump administration and the Biden administration 
have imposed numerous financial sanctions against members of 
the Nicaraguan government, their legislature, their judiciary, 
and President Ortega's family.
    In December of 2021, Nicaragua reestablished diplomatic 
ties with China and seized control of Taiwan's embassy and 
diplomatic offices, saying that they belong to China.
    The Ortega regime provided Taiwanese diplomats only two 
weeks to leave Nicaragua. Subsequently, the Nicaraguan 
government signed a cooperation agreement for China's Belt and 
Road Initiative. That took place in January of 2022.
    In June of 2022, the Ortega regime and his rubber stamp 
congress authorized a limited number of Russian troops, Russian 
aircraft and ships and weapons to operate on Nicaraguan soil.
    This seems to be a renewal and an expansion of the November 
2021 authorization for Russian forces to operate there in the 
country.
    Mr. Rodriguez, in your view, what is the most concerning 
aspect of Nicaragua as it relates to U.S. national security?
    Mr. Rodriguez. Thank you, Senator.
    Their relationships with both of the countries you 
mentioned are deeply, deeply concerning. The decision by the 
government of Nicaragua to leave off recognition of Taiwan in 
favor of the PRC was deeply lamentable.
    The government is depriving the Nicaraguan citizens of a 
reliably democratic partner in favor of opacity and self-
dealing, which is entirely in line with what the government of 
Nicaragua has been about since 2018.
    Their slide towards authoritarianism and away from 
transparency and rule of law are deeply concerning.
    With respect to Russia, Senator, they are, clearly, 
following the Russian playbook, and with support and guidance 
from Russia they are drafting and implementing laws. In fact, 
the foreign agents law in Nicaragua is known locally as Putin's 
Law. So there is, clearly, deep influence from Russia.
    If confirmed, I believe we need to very loudly stand with 
the Nicaraguan people against anyone who is aligned with Russia 
or China in stifling the democratic aspirations of the people 
of Nicaragua and abusing and taking from them their human 
rights.
    Senator Hagerty. Well said.
    Mr. Rodriguez. Thank you.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will submit the 
rest of my questions for the record.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Senator Hagerty.
    I have one additional question that I want to direct to Ms. 
Fulton--an Uruguay question--and it is really more of a kind of 
a topic than a question, and since you are pro with long 
experience in the region, I just kind of want to grapple with 
it.
    We are talking an awful lot about problems in the region 
and there are problems by the boatload, but there is also some 
real success stories. So Panama, the Dominican Republic, Costa 
Rica, and Ecuador have come together with the Alliance for 
Democracy and Development. They have said at a time of 
democratic backsliding we want to be forward leaning.
    But in my conversations with them they have not yet been, I 
think, impressed with the degree to which the United States 
want to work with them to succeed. I will say this. There was 
an agreement signed in the last couple of days focusing on near 
shoring in the ADD. That can be great.
    So Ecuador--we met with the president of Ecuador, President 
Lasso, a pro-U.S. president, about a year ago, and he said, 
look, the one thing that can really help us succeed is if the 
U.S. would contemplate a trade agreement with Ecuador, possibly 
including Ecuador in the existing trade agreement with 
Colombia.
    We had a hearing yesterday about economic statecraft with 
State Department witnesses. I asked has there--are we doing 
anything to follow up on that, and I got a diplomatic answer 
but I think the answer, really, was no because I am not sure 
that the Administration really likes trade agreements.
    And then we have got this situation where Guyana, which has 
come through this very difficult time, and I know Guyana is not 
on the panel today, but they really wanted this IDB loan to 
develop their energy resources and it was the U.S. that vetoed 
the loan, which hurts their own economic development and 
probably also hurts an ability for Guyana to be an important 
and more stable energy partner in a world marked by too many 
unstable authoritarian energy partners.
    So Uruguay is a model in so many ways. Uruguay is now doing 
trade agreement--free trade agreements with Turkey and China, 
and the president has indicated--the president of Uruguay--that 
it would very much like to do a trade agreement with the U.S. 
and also with the U.K. but the quote from the president is the 
U.S. Government, quote, ``is not looking south.''
    It seems to me in a part of the world where we have got a 
lot of challenges the best thing we could do is take the 
nations that are favorably inclined to us, that want deeper 
relationships with us, where the trend lines for democracy are 
green rather than red--they are going in the right direction--
and why not really invest in these nations because they can 
become examples for others, and if with their entreaties we are 
not investing in these nations that also sends a message that 
can be a very debilitating one.
    So, I guess, should you be confirmed in Uruguay with the 
experience you have, with the positive track record that 
Uruguay has put together, what can we do to really spotlight 
this relationship and do it in a way that is not only good for 
Uruguay but sends the message in the region that if you are 
doing things right the United States is going to be a great 
partner with you?
    Ms. Fulton. Thank you, Senator. I think you have touched on 
a question that I have, certainly, grappled with and, if 
confirmed, would look forward to working with you and your 
staff and other members of this committee to try to find better 
answers to exactly that question.
    I think that if confirmed being an Ambassador not only 
means representing U.S. policies to the partner to whom I am 
accredited but it also means representing back the importance 
and the opportunity--Senator Rubio touched on the importance of 
thinking strategically about the investments and decisions that 
we make--we have tremendous challenges in this hemisphere, and 
I know from my current position we prioritize those with our 
funding and our resources based on some of the problems that 
are closer to home and more immediately on fire in front of us.
    I, if confirmed, would look forward to being a loud 
proponent to arguing for strategic investments and seeking 
additional opportunities, seeking ways to rethink some of the 
impediments that we have in place and seeking new tools to 
strengthen a relationship that is with a partner whom, as you 
have noted, genuinely wants to work with us and I think the 
importance of this opportunity should not be understated and it 
should not be lost.
    Senator Kaine. I appreciate that testimony. I think you are 
right on sort of the human psychology. We tend to focus on the 
problems and that is natural. But our ability to solve problems 
in countries with deep problems we have to be very humble about 
it.
    I mean, these are, ultimately, problems that need to be 
solved within and we can be assets. We can be helpful. But in a 
region where there are plenty of problems there is also plenty 
of good that is going on and I just feel like we are, in some 
instances, kind of ignoring the good or under investing our 
time where there is good or, in some instances, even taking 
steps that are counterproductive to allies that are trying to 
do it the right way.
    I just hope we will focus more on some bright spots and try 
to make them even brighter. That would be my hope, and I think 
you are very, very well equipped to carry that mission.
    Senator Rubio, do you have any additional questions?
    Senator Hagerty, additional questions?
    [No response.]
    Senator Kaine. Listen, I really appreciate this 
opportunity. It has been a great discussion. Committee members 
are very, very interested in these countries. We will do all we 
can to be prompt in moving forward from this point.
    I would asked members of the committee should they have 
questions that they want to submit in writing--a number have 
indicated that they would--they should submit them by the close 
of business on July 29th, and I would also ask that each of 
you, should questions be submitted for you individually, that 
you try to respond promptly and comprehensively.
    And with that, this hearing is adjourned.


    [Whereupon, at 11:34 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]



                              ----------                              



              Additional Material Submitted for the Record


            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
        Submitted to William H. Duncan by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Human Rights report, El 
Salvador was noted for significant human rights abuses such as unlawful 
killings, forced disappearances by military personnel, torture or cruel 
and degrading treatment by security forces, arbitrary arrest and 
detention, serious problems with the independence of the judiciary, 
serious restrictions of expression and assembly, inability of the 
people to change their government peacefully, serious acts of official 
corruption, criminalization of same-sex conduct, and impunity persisted 
in the security forces, executive branch, and the justice system.

   What is your assessment of the persistence of these violations?

    Answer. I am deeply concerned by the persistent trend of democratic 
backsliding and growing human rights abuses in El Salvador. 
Consolidation of power in the executive stymies free expression of 
ideas and checks-and-balances vital to the democratic process. 
Preserving civic space and protecting freedom of expression remain 
imperative tasks for the preservation of democracy and the promotion of 
human rights.

    Question. If confirmed, what actions would you take with host 
government to address these issues? Do you commit to raising these 
issues directly with the host government?

    Answer. I commit to continually raising these issues directly with 
the Government of El Salvador, highlighting the importance of 
respecting democracy and human rights and holding those who commit 
abuses accountable for their actions. If confirmed, I will work 
diligently to ensure that journalists and civil society have the space 
to operate without undue influence from the Government. If confirmed, I 
will continue to support the appropriate use of all congressionally 
mandated sanctions authority to combat corruption and undemocratic 
actions in El Salvador.

    Question. In the report, it was noted that while there are no 
reports of politically motivated killings, there were reports of 
security forces engaged in extrajudicial killings of suspected gang 
members. What steps would you take with security forces officials to 
increase respect of the legal system and limit extrajudicial punishment 
by security forces?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue to raise concerns with the 
central government over the increasing use of military in police 
operations, as well as concerns over the lack of due process during the 
State of Exception. I will also continue interagency efforts to train a 
competent and professional cohort of law enforcement that respects 
human rights, including through ethics and use of force training. I 
commit to engaging with central government and municipal authorities to 
impress upon them the importance of adherence to rule of law. Finally, 
if confirmed, I will continue to support the appropriate use of all 
congressionally mandated sanctions and visa restrictions tools to 
counter corruption and impunity in El Salvador.

    Question. The report additionally states that prison conditions 
remain harsh and threatening due to gross overcrowding, unhygienic 
conditions, and gang activity as well as a lack of the right to a fair 
trial through judicial authorities being subject to political, 
economic, or other corrupting influences.

   How would you encourage the host government on prison authorities 
        to improve prison conditions and reduce gang violence in 
        detention centers?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will engage willing and able security and 
penal sector partners and evaluate where the United States can provide 
direct support or assistance. I will continue to underscore the 
unsustainability of the State of Exception and champion adherence to 
due process and humane prison conditions.

    Question. What steps would you take with the host government 
regarding the judicial system to reduce the level of corruption amongst 
trial judges?

    Answer. Impunity, corruption, and lack of independence among judges 
are unacceptable. I will engage the Government of El Salvador to 
underscore the importance of adherence to rule of law from both a human 
rights and economic growth perspective. If confirmed, I will continue 
to support the use of congressionally mandated sanctions and visa 
restrictions authorities to combat corruption within the ranks of trial 
judges.

    Question. Please describe how you would work with various 
interagency entities like the new Anti-Corruption coordinator to combat 
corruption in country.

    Answer. Corruption remains a top threat to efficacy of democratic 
governance. The President has made clear that corruption is also a 
threat to U.S. national security. The U.S. Strategy on Countering 
Corruption identifies a range of activities that the Administration 
will undertake around the world and highlights tools that can be 
utilized, specifically in El Salvador. If confirmed, I will tap into 
the expertise of all my interagency colleagues, including the 
Department of the Treasury, Department of Justice, and the State 
Department's new Coordinator on Global Anti-Corruption to identify 
corrupt actors and hold them accountable for their actions.

   Working with partners like USAID, I will continue to fight for the 
        preservation of civic space, providing non-governmental 
        organizations and civil society representatives needed 
        opportunities and open dialogue to identify corruption and 
        promote democracy. This must be an interagency effort, and I 
        commit to treating it as such through interagency collaboration 
        and communication.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons 
report, El Salvador was downgraded to the Tier 2 watch list for not 
fully meeting the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. 
Fewer than half of identified victims received government services, the 
Government implemented no procedures to identify potential victims or 
traffickers and did not initiate any investigations, prosecutions, or 
convictions of officials allegedly complicit in human trafficking 
crimes. The anti-trafficking council was inactive and did not draft a 
national anti-trafficking plan, publish a report on government efforts, 
or compile any data across governmental agencies.

   If confirmed, how could you work with government officials to 
        increase the frequency of providing government services to 
        trafficking victims and number of investigations against 
        traffickers?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will encourage the Government of El 
Salvador to increase specialized services for trafficking victims; 
implement procedures to proactively identify and refer to service 
providers victims from at-risk groups--including individuals in 
commercial sex, children apprehended for illicit gang-related 
activities, forcibly displaced persons, and irregular migrants 
returning to El Salvador; strengthen the specialized anti-trafficking 
prosecution unit; develop a mechanism to enforce payment of court-
ordered restitution to victims; allow authorities and the public to 
refer potential victims directly to government or NGO service 
providers, without first referring to police or prosecutors; provide 
reintegration and livelihood support services for victims and extend 
witness protection services beyond the duration of a trial, 
particularly for victims who testify against members of organized 
criminal groups; amend the 2014 anti-trafficking law to include a 
definition of human trafficking consistent with international law, 
draft, resource, and implement a new National Action Plan to combat 
trafficking; develop a case management system to improve data 
collection, sharing, security, and analysis related to trafficking 
cases; expand prevention measures, including through raising awareness 
of fraudulent recruitment for employment in El Salvador and abroad and 
by holding accountable employers or recruiters who commit fraudulent 
practices that facilitate trafficking.

    Question. How would you engage with the anti-trafficking council to 
urge it into action in providing a national anti-trafficking plan and 
reports on governmental efforts?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will encourage all relevant authorities to 
continue to make progress against trafficking in persons in the areas 
of prosecution, protection, and prevention, including by drafting, 
allocating resources for, and implementing a new National Action Plan 
and reporting on government efforts.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, El Salvador's constitution provides for freedom of 
religion, many areas are controlled by gangs limiting access religious 
registration, freedom of movement, and are subject to being engaged by 
violent acts.

   What actions would you take with the host government to promote 
        government officials carrying out their official duties, 
        primarily in areas most affected by gang violence?

    Answer. As Secretary Blinken has said, respect for religious 
freedom is one of our deepest held values, a fundamental right, and a 
vital foreign policy priority. If confirmed, I would communicate to the 
Government, and publicly, our deeply held belief in the importance of 
religious freedom. I would support efforts to improve the ability of 
the Salvadoran police to provide citizen security in a climate of 
respect for the due process of law. If confirmed, I would also work 
closely with the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious 
Freedom to develop a plan for constructive engagement with the 
Government of El Salvador.

    Question. US officials in the embassy have attempted to promote 
religious freedoms and reach followers in gang-controlled territories. 
What actions would you take to further promote these efforts?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would communicate to the Government and 
publicly that promoting respect for religious freedom is a core part of 
our foreign policy. I would also support Embassy engagement with faith-
based and secular communities throughout El Salvador to ensure we have 
a comprehensive understanding of the challenges these groups face and 
how best we can support their right to freedom of religion or belief. 
In the context of the State of Exception gang crackdown that began in 
March 2022, a worrying trend has emerged of government officials 
targeting faith-based institutions, including rehabilitation centers, 
to arrest former gang members. If confirmed, I will encourage the 
Government to refrain from such activities which may constrain 
religious practice and may discourage other gang members from seeking 
rehabilitative services in order to exit gang life.

    Question. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the U.N., including in elections 
for specialized bodies like the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who if 
elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. 
She is in a tough race that will require early, consistent engagement 
across capitals and within the U.N. member states.

   If confirmed, do you commit to demarching the El Salvador 
        Government and any other counterparts necessary to encourage 
        their support of Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to demarching the Government of El 
Salvador to encourage their support of Ms. Bogdan-Martin.

    Question. If confirmed, how can you work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify, recruit, 
and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior Program 
Officer (JPO) program at the U.N.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to working closely with the 
International Organizations (IO) bureau, the Population, Refugees, and 
Migration (PRM) bureau, and other stakeholders to identify ways to 
support qualified Americans in international organizations. I 
understand PRM funding varies from year to year to sponsor new Junior 
Program Officer positions with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR), typically in the range of 6 to 10 new posts, and with the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM), usually one new JPO 
position annually. If confirmed, I will work with our colleagues inside 
the U.S. Government and through external partners to explore ways to 
contribute to this important program.

    Question. El Salvador has a low rate of voting coincidence with the 
U.S. in the U.N. General Assembly and in the Security Council.

   What is your assessment of this issue?

    Answer. El Salvador under the Bukele administration has moved 
farther away from voting coincidence with the United States and many of 
our key fellow democracies in the Hemisphere and beyond. It perhaps 
reflects diverging views on issues such as democracy and separation of 
powers. If confirmed, an important part of my duties will be trying to 
redress this situation and engage the Government of El Salvador with a 
perspective that its interests, its crucial relationship with the 
United States of America, and the interests of the international 
community are best served by a return to the constructive dialogue and 
frequent congruence of views the two countries used to enjoy.

    Question. If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to 
engage with the El Salvadorans on anticipated votes in the U.N. system 
that would increase their voting coincidence with the U.S.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will engage the Salvadoran Government to 
impress upon them U.S. views regarding anticipated votes in the U.N. 
system. This includes ensuring they understand both the substantive 
reasons underlying U.S. positions and the value the United States 
places on cooperation with likeminded countries in U.N. fora. The 
United States is El Salvador's most important international partner, 
and the two countries should be better aligned in international 
organizations.

    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID.

   What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission San 
        Salvador?

    Answer. My understanding is that morale is high in San Salvador. 
The interim leaders who have taken the helm since Charge d'Affaires 
Manes' departure last year have done a fantastic job at fostering an 
environment of inclusiveness within the Mission. If confirmed, I will 
build on my predecessors' work to develop a healthy, happy, and 
effective community in Mission San Salvador.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission San 
Salvador?

    Answer. There are several ways to improve morale at our overseas 
Missions. If confirmed, I will focus on putting people first and 
encouraging healthy work/life balance. I will work diligently with 
Deputy Chief of Mission Dueholm to ensure foundational needs, such as 
healthcare, childcare, and pay issues are met so our community can 
focus on fulfilling the mission at hand. I will ensure mentoring and 
professional development opportunities for all staff so they can 
develop their skills and achieve their individual professional 
development goals. I will also ensure my colleagues understand their 
importance in the work we do and why that work matters. People who know 
they are engaged in meaningful work and understand their leaders care 
about them as individuals can do amazing things together and enjoy a 
sense of fulfillment that fosters high morale.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission San Salvador?

    Answer. A unified mission and vision can only be achieved when each 
member of the team knows what they are working toward and knows how 
their individual role supports the Mission's ultimate goal. If 
confirmed, I will ensure each member of Mission San Salvador knows our 
objectives and the actions we will take to reach them. I will foster an 
environment of openness and acceptance that promotes teamwork and 
collaboration.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. My management style is collaborative and collegial. I work 
to ensure the overall goals of the Mission are well understood, and 
that I in turn understand the individual mission of each agency at 
post. I actively seek ideas from staff on how we can best accomplish 
our goals and engage staff in a continuous effort to monitor, evaluate, 
and learn from what we are doing. I ensure rules regarding ethics, 
equal employment opportunity, and workplace behavior are understood and 
enforced. I engage continuously with different offices and agencies to 
ensure that I am effectively supporting their work. I also seek to 
mentor and develop subordinates to ensure they can achieve their 
personal goals and to develop the next generation of senior leaders. I 
keep a close eye on morale and work to improve it. Finally, I encourage 
personnel to take time to care for themselves, their families, and 
their loved ones.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No. Belittling or bullying subordinates is abhorrent to me, 
and few things are more destructive to individuals or organizations. My 
colleagues are invaluable to our success in advancing the shared 
interests of the United States with foreign partners. I am dedicated to 
mentoring and developing the leadership and operational skills needed 
on our team to help each individual contribute their maximum potential 
to advancing our mission.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. As a former DCM, I can attest to the enormous 
responsibility a deputy carries in their role and the indispensable 
value of working in tandem with the Chief of Mission to execute U.S. 
policy. If confirmed, I will forge a joint leadership team with the DCM 
as my full partner in all our work. The DCM is vital to successful 
development of U.S. policy, strategy, outreach, management of U.S. 
taxpayer resources, and our workforce--the lifeblood of diplomacy and 
U.S. relationships with sovereign nations. A strong partnership between 
the Chief and Deputy Chief of Mission is essential to advancing a 
common vision across the entire Country Team.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. The DCMs are our first line of response to all section 
heads and agency leaders at our posts. If confirmed, I will entrust my 
deputy to advise our leaders across the mission, develop our newest 
employees' talents, and help our team rise to the challenges they face 
daily in their work for the American people. I would depend on the 
DCM's wise counsel in managing the Embassy team, U.S. resources, and 
executing policy objectives. Ultimate responsibility for the mission 
and all its work will fall to me, if confirmed, but I will rely on the 
DCM to ensure our team is empowered to present the best advice, 
analysis, and proposed courses of action possible.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Yes. As a Deputy Chief of Mission and Principal Officer, my 
most important work in developing the U.S. mission was investing in the 
capabilities and capacities of our team. I met regularly with our local 
staff, our newest officers and specialists, our mid-level 
professionals, and our senior leaders to share lessons I have 
accumulated over a career in challenging environments. From time to 
time, all of us need constructive feedback to meet our full potential. 
Providing this guidance is an essential duty of mission leaders. 
Recognizing and rewarding our outstanding employees' work is a powerful 
means of boosting morale in difficult circumstances, showing our team 
the value of the work we do and of the people who do it. If confirmed, 
I will ensure employees have the guidance they need to succeed in their 
work and recognition for their dedicated work.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes. In addition to providing accurate, timely, and 
constructive feedback to employees on their performance and encouraging 
other supervisors in the Mission to do likewise, the Department of 
State awards program is an important tool to recognize top performers 
and to highlight the sort of work we should all strive to emulate.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
El Salvador.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to working with our professional 
Diplomatic Security colleagues, our Emergency Action Committee, and the 
Country Team to appropriately balance our safety and security 
obligations while meeting the full spectrum of our duties to meet with 
our counterparts and the people of El Salvador and develop meaningful 
ties across the country.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. I will ensure our diplomats understand the importance of 
accessing all local populations and are given the time and tools to get 
out of their offices and conduct that engagement regularly. I will also 
set a personal example by engaging the broadest possible range of 
Salvadoran society. I will work with our Diplomatic Security experts to 
ensure we are fully aware of risks and are managing and mitigating 
those risks prudently. This will facilitate our diplomats' engagement 
with local populations.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts.

   What is the public diplomacy environment like in El Salvador?

    Answer. Public diplomacy is a unique challenge in El Salvador. The 
Bukele administration's recently enacted law criminalizing reporting on 
gang activities has had a noticeable chilling effect on the local 
independent media. Additionally, several journalists have reported 
their phones being hacked, confirmed by Citizen Lab researchers as 
Pegasus attacks. These specific events, along with the Administration's 
vast network of disinformation experts, has created an austere 
environment for public diplomacy.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. U.S. diplomats face myriad unique public diplomacy 
challenges in El Salvador. Two of the top challenges are combatting the 
spread of official disinformation through conventional reporting or on 
social media and addressing fears of reprisal for speaking negatively 
of the Administration.
    Mission San Salvador's Public Affairs Section advances U.S. foreign 
policy priorities by polling the local populace and developing pointed 
messaging campaigns. With strong ties between the two nations, 
including roughly 2.5 million Salvadorans living in the United States, 
Salvadorans hold a generally favorable view of the United States and 
are receptive to Mission San Salvador messaging.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. Public messaging takes a coordinated effort from Washington 
and our foreign missions. Main State policy objectives must be tailored 
to host-nation contexts. If confirmed, I will provide Main State with a 
comprehensive ground-level view of the situation in El Salvador and 
provide recommendations for nuanced messaging that best reaches the 
local population.
    If confirmed, I will work closely with interagency counterparts and 
Main State to use the proper tools and channels to promote a unified 
voice.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to taking the ``Havana Syndrome'' 
threat seriously. I have already attended classified and unclassified 
briefings on AHI, including a briefing from the Coordinator of the 
Department of State's Health Incident Response Task Force (HIRTF). I 
have no higher priority than the health and security of the people with 
whom I serve. Secretary Blinken prioritizes the Department's response 
to AHIs, setting clear goals for the HIRTF to strengthen the 
Department's communication with its workforce and providing care for 
affected employees and family members.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission San Salvador personnel?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to engaging Mission San Salvador 
personnel regularly, frequently, and openly both individually and 
collectively. Effective communication is key to successful leadership.

                    follow up question submitted to 
                   william h. duncan by senator risch
          Question. Please provide an assessment of whether the 
        regulatory framework applicable to the use of Bitcoin as legal 
        tender in El Salvador meets the requirements of the Financial 
        Action Task Force with respect to virtual-asset transactions.

          Answer. While a country's adoption of private digital assets, 
        including cryptocurrencies, as legal tender is a sovereign 
        decision, we encourage governments exploring the adoption or 
        promotion of these assets to abide by applicable legal and 
        regulatory recommendations and international standards, such as 
        those set out by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Such 
        compliance and adherence to international standards is critical 
        to maintaining public trust in the financial system and 
        ensuring safety and stability, transparency, integrity, 
        operational efficiency, and equitable access while mitigating 
        illicit financing risks. All completed FATF mutual evaluations 
        are publicly available on the FATF's website; however, the FATF 
        has not yet reviewed the regulatory framework regarding El 
        Salvador's adoption of bitcoin. I would also refer you to the 
        Department of Treasury as head of delegation to the FATF and 
        FATF-style regional bodies for specifics.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
         Submitted to William H. Duncan by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. It should be clear to everyone in this administration 
that the Chinese Communist Party is the most comprehensive military, 
economic and political threat our nation faces today. Right now, in 
Latin America and the Caribbean, it is working to undermine our 
interests and our allies, whether that's by supplying the fentanyl 
smuggled across our open border or assisting dictators that continue to 
drive people to emigrate to the U.S.

   Is the Chinese Communist Party a threat to the United States?

    Answer. The President has made it clear the United States views the 
People's Republic of China (PRC) as a strategic competitor that 
challenges the existing rules-based international order. PRC and 
Chinese Communist Party activities represent a challenge to U.S. 
interests in the region, particularly in terms of investments in 
critical infrastructure and sensitive sectors such as transportation 
facilities and telecommunication projects.
    As Secretary Blinken said on May 26, we will invest, align, and 
compete with the PRC to defend our interests and build our vision for 
the future. If confirmed, I will invest in our partnership with El 
Salvador; highlight the risks associated with PRC engagement that could 
impact El Salvador's security, sovereignty, international standing, and 
U.S. interests; and ensure that our vision of a partnership that 
promotes human rights, regional security, and prosperity competes 
successfully with the PRC.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to stop the expansion of 
the CCP's influence in El Salvador?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will invest in our partnership with El 
Salvador; highlight the risks associated with PRC engagement that could 
impact El Salvador's security, sovereignty, international standing, and 
U.S. interests; and ensure that our vision of a partnership that 
promotes human rights, regional security, and prosperity competes 
successfully with the PRC. If confirmed, I will raise with Government 
of El Salvador and private sector interlocutors concerns over PRC 
infrastructure projects with inadequate labor and environmental 
standards, which undermine workers' rights under domestic law and, more 
generally, international labor standards. I will also stress to the 
Salvadoran Government and communicate to the Salvadoran people the 
problematic tactics used by the PRC in international engagements, as 
witnessed in other countries in the Hemisphere.

    Question. For years, the United States has developed regional 
strategies that guide our policy towards Central America, including El 
Salvador. Although our relations remain with El Salvador, they aren't 
as strong as at the beginning of Bukele's Administration. Over the 
years, President Bukele has increasingly embraced Russia and the 
Chinese Communist Party. For example, in the last several United 
Nations votes condemning Putin's invasion of Ukraine, El Salvador has 
abstained rather than vote with the U.S. and its allies.

   What are the reasons for this breakdown in relations with El 
        Salvador?

    Answer. Continued instances of democratic backsliding and 
challenges to the rule of law by the Government of El Salvador over the 
past few years, including entering the Legislative Assembly with armed 
police and soldiers, the removal of the top five justices of the 
Supreme Court, and actions taken under the State of Exception, have 
strained our bilateral relationship. If confirmed, I commit to engaging 
the Government of El Salvador from a place of respect for their 
sovereignty, while maintaining a firm condemnation of antidemocratic 
actions, impunity, and attacks on civil liberties and human rights. I 
will continue to support the appropriate use of congressionally 
mandated sanction authorities to discourage corruption in El Salvador.
    Despite these difficulties in our bilateral relationship, if 
confirmed, I will continue to cooperate with El Salvador where possible 
and appropriate on security issues, working for instance to strengthen 
and professionalize police services. At the same time, I would strive 
to identify opportunities for economic investment, combatting 
corruption and impunity, and growing the economy to benefit Salvadorans 
and address the root causes of migration.

    Question. Can you provide the committee with a general view of El 
Salvador's existing relations with China? How about with Russia?

    Answer. El Salvador deepened its ties with the PRC since officially 
recognizing Beijing in 2018, including through agreements to develop 
various infrastructure projects. Through the Confucius Institute, the 
PRC has taken aim at developing cultural ties with Latin America. While 
not as economically influential as the PRC, Russia's influence in the 
region has revealed itself through authoritarian tendencies, such as 
the currently shelved Foreign Agent's law. Additionally, El Salvador's 
failure to join resolutions on Ukraine in the OAS and U.N. show a 
potential sympathetic approach to Russian policy. Central America's 
geographic proximity to the United States offers an enticing location 
for nefarious Russian and PRC intelligence actors and activities.

    Question. Mr. Duncan, if confirmed, part of your job will consist 
of reinforcing our current ties with the Bukele administration. What 
are your top three priorities, if confirmed?

    Answer. If confirmed, in addition to protecting U.S. citizens, I 
will prioritize our engagement with El Salvador on fighting corruption 
and impunity, strengthening democratic institutions that protect civil 
liberties, and promoting inclusive economic growth and opportunities 
for all Salvadorans to address the root causes of irregular migration.

    Question. El Salvador has historically been both a major source and 
transit point of illegal immigration to the United States. During the 
Trump administration, the U.S. Government reduced assistance to 
Bukele's Government until they demonstrated that they were enforcing El 
Salvador's laws on immigration. The Biden administration is taking a 
different approach by requesting increased funding for foreign 
assistance to El Salvador under its ``Strategy to Address the Root 
Causes of Migration.''

   Is the Bukele Government enforcing its own national laws to prevent 
        pass-through migration and prevent illegal immigration?

    Answer. The Bukele administration has routinely supported U.S. 
efforts to reduce irregular migration in the region. While DHS reports 
record numbers of Salvadoran encounters in FY 2022, the Government of 
El Salvador continues to accept three repatriation flights per week, 
meeting current DHS needs. Additionally, the Government of El Salvador 
remains a staunch supporter and participant in the Biden 
administration's robust H-2 visa program, providing Salvadorans a legal 
alternative to irregular migration.
    As the host of the Grupo Conjunto Inteligencia Fronteriza (GCIF), a 
regional border intelligence and collaboration center, the Government 
of El Salvador plays a role in improving regional awareness of cross-
border criminal elements, including human smuggling, to help inform law 
enforcement responses. Furthermore, through INL-supported law 
enforcement vetted units, including the HSI-supported Transnational 
Criminal Investigative Unit (TCIU), El Salvador successfully 
investigates and disrupts transnational human smuggling and trafficking 
networks with assistance from the United States and other nations.
    If confirmed, I will continue to work with the Government of El 
Salvador to address the root causes of irregular migration.

    Question. How is the Biden administration's strategy not simply 
rewarding the bad behavior of a government that continues to not work 
with the U.S. in preventing illegal immigration?

    Answer. The U.S. Strategy to Address the Root Causes of Migration 
prioritizes expanding broad-based economic growth, strengthening 
democratic governance and the rule of law, promoting human rights, 
improving citizen security, and reducing gender-based violence. Through 
diplomatic engagement, we seek to have El Salvador undertake reforms 
necessary to improve conditions such that Salvadorans can build the 
futures they want in their communities. Our foreign assistance programs 
support those efforts. If confirmed, I would continue to push for the 
Salvadoran Government to implement necessary reforms in support of 
these efforts.
    U.S. Government foreign assistance funding is not handed over to 
partner governments to use as they see fit. The Department of State and 
USAID work with a variety of implementing partners beyond the 
governments, including civil society and international organizations, 
to implement assistance programs focused on anticorruption, 
transparency, responsive governance, and respect for human rights.

    Question. Given the Bukele Government's decision to adopt bitcoin 
as a national currency and other questionable fiscal decisions, are you 
confident that his Government can manage U.S. foreign assistance it 
receives in an accountable way?

    Answer. U.S. Government foreign assistance funding does not go to 
the Salvadoran Government to manage. The Department of State and USAID 
work with a variety of implementing partners beyond the Government, 
including civil society and international organizations, to implement 
assistance programs focused on anticorruption, transparency, responsive 
governance, and respect for human rights. When we do partner with the 
Government of El Salvador, a great part of such assistance is non-
monetary and provided through technical assistance to government 
institutions to improve their capacity and effectiveness.
    If confirmed, I will ensure we maintain strict oversight of our 
programs and report regularly on our efforts to Congress.

    Question. I believe it is important that our regional approach 
continues to include respect for democratic institutions, the rule of 
law, and the defense of human rights. El Salvador's democracy faces a 
number of challenges from irregular migration, the recovery from the 
COVID pandemic, and corruption.

   If confirmed, how will you work to address these challenges?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would advocate for stronger democratic 
institutions, respect for human rights, and adherence to the rule of 
law emphasizing the need for comprehensive solutions to systemic 
problems. A strong and vibrant democracy lays the foundation for long-
term stability and economic opportunity necessary to reduce irregular 
migration. I would use the full scope of diplomatic and foreign 
assistance tools to work with Salvadorans to strengthen democratic 
institutions, increase respect for the rule of law, defend human 
rights, with a focus on protecting civil society and freedom of 
expression.

    Question. Do you agree with the decision made by the Biden 
administration to reprogram USAID's assistance for the Salvadorian 
Attorney General's office to civil society groups? Why?

    Answer. Recent decisions by the Bukele administration have 
undermined the legitimacy and reliability of certain institutions, 
including the office of the Attorney General. If confirmed, I would 
support actions that shift assistance to civil society as a more 
efficient and effective use of taxpayer dollars, and that send a signal 
that legitimacy is a crucial element of success in strengthening 
institutions.

    Question. Some members of Congress have called for the removal of 
El Salvador from the CAFTA-DR agreement in order to compel greater 
respect for democracy and human rights.

   What are your views on the consequences of that action if it was to 
        happen?

    Answer. CAFTA-DR remains critical to creating a stable economic 
environment in Central America and opportunities for the people of the 
region. The agreement has benefited U.S. businesses and Salvadorans.
    If confirmed, I will work to encourage greater respect for 
democracy and human rights in El Salvador and to promote the rule of 
law and an improved investment climate in line with CAFTA-DR.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
          to Hugo F. Rodriguez, Jr. by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Human Rights report, 
Nicaragua is noted for numerous human abuses. The Ortega regime has 
taken no steps to identify, investigate, prosecute, or punish officials 
who committed these violations. There was no action to address 
widespread government corruption, and President Ortega actively 
strengthened impunity among human rights abusers who demonstrated 
loyalty to him. Corruption and flagrant human rights abuse remains 
pervasive among government entities. If confirmed, what actions would 
you take with host government to address these issues?

    Answer. President Ortega and Vice President Murillo and their 
collaborators continue to commit human rights abuses against the people 
of Nicaragua. The United States remains open to frank discussions on 
steps to return to democracy and respect for human rights in Nicaragua, 
but the Ortega-Murillo regime has not shown interest in a genuine 
dialogue. If confirmed, I would work with relevant stakeholders to use 
the economic and diplomatic tools at our disposal, including bilateral 
and multilateral engagement, sanctions, and visa restrictions, as 
appropriate, to support Nicaraguans' calls for democracy and justice 
and to promote accountability for those who carry out or are complicit 
in abuses. I would also work with international partners, to include in 
the OAS and the U.N. Human Rights Council, to support resolutions and 
statements on the situation in Nicaragua, addressing attacks on 
democracy and human rights and supporting those who protect and defend 
those principles. I would facilitate the work of the group of human 
rights experts on Nicaragua, established by the March 2022 U.N. Human 
Rights Council resolution on the promotion and protection of human 
rights in Nicaragua.

    Question. What steps would you take amongst civil society groups 
and international organizations to help bolster civil society of 
Nicaragua from the Ortega regime?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would support the Nicaraguan people in 
their efforts to recover their democracy, support a free and 
independent press, and promote the rule of law and respect for human 
rights. I would ensure that U.S. assistance programs effectively 
support Nicaraguan partners, including civil society groups, human 
rights defenders, faith-based organizations, journalists, and social 
movements working within and outside of Nicaragua. If confirmed, I 
would also work with the U.N. Human Rights Council, the European Union, 
Canada, the United Kingdom, the Organization of American States, and 
other international partners to continue to speak out clearly in 
defense of democracy and human rights in Nicaragua.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to raising these serious 
issues directly with the Ortega regime?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to maintaining communication with 
the regime on a range of issues of importance to the United States and 
to seek out new opportunities for dialogue. So far, the Ortega-Murillo 
regime has not shown interest in a genuine dialogue on human rights, 
democracy, or other U.S. priorities. Nevertheless, I commit to 
continuing to raise these issues directly with the regime.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons 
report, Nicaragua remained Tier 3 for not fully meeting the minimum 
standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making any 
significant efforts to do so. The Government continues to downplay the 
severity of the trafficking problem and contradicts civil society 
reports of an increase in cases throughout the pandemic. If confirmed, 
how could you work with civil society and government entities to 
improve reporting, victim services, and overall anti-trafficking work?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would urge the Nicaraguan Government to 
work towards completing the prioritized recommendations as laid out in 
the 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report, including to increase efforts 
to identify trafficking victims. I would also support NGO partners 
seeking to provide trafficking victims with care and reintegration 
services, as well as those civil society groups that call on the 
Nicaraguan Government to respect the rule of law and human rights and 
to return to democracy.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, while Nicaragua's constitution prohibits discrimination 
on basis of religion, the president threatens, harasses, and routinely 
violates religious freedoms against any religious organizations not 
demonstrating loyalty to his regime. Attempts by embassy officials to 
reach out to the Government have been unsuccessful. If confirmed, what 
actions could you take to encourage the host government to bring 
government officials to engage with US officials to promote religious 
freedoms?

    Answer. The Nicaraguan Government continues to undermine religious 
freedom, and we remain concerned about individuals and groups closely 
associated with the Government, as well as government officials 
themselves, continuing to harass, insult, and make death threats 
against Catholic clergy. If confirmed, I would call on the Nicaraguan 
Government to promote and guarantee the safety of religious leaders and 
worshippers along with the security of all places of worship in 
Nicaragua. I would also work closely with the office of the Ambassador-
at-Large for International Religious Freedom to strongly press the 
Nicaraguan Government to engage in constructive dialogue on promoting 
respect for religious freedom.

    Question. US officials have been able to engage with a variety of 
religious leaders in the country, how would you further these efforts 
to facilitate discussion on religious tolerance and freedom?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would continue to engage with a variety of 
religious leaders in Nicaragua to better understand their concerns and 
the threats against them. Given the threats by the Ortega-Murillo 
regime and its supporters against the Catholic Church, if confirmed, I 
would take steps to ensure that any discussion with religious leaders 
on religious tolerance and freedom were carried out in a way that does 
not put them at greater risk of government harassment and repression.

    Question. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the U.N., including in elections 
for specialized bodies like the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who if 
elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. 
She is in a tough race that will require early, consistent engagement 
across capitals and within the U.N. member states. If confirmed, do you 
commit to demarching the Nicaraguan Government and any other 
counterparts necessary to encourage their support of Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to demarching the Nicaraguan 
Government to encourage their support of Ms. Bogdan-Martin.

    Question. If confirmed, how can you work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify, recruit, 
and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior Program 
Officer (JPO) program at the U.N.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to working closely with the 
International Organizations (IO) bureau, the Population, Refugees, and 
Migration (PRM) bureau, and other stakeholders to identify ways to 
support qualified Americans in international organizations. I 
understand PRM funding varies from year to year to sponsor new Junior 
Program Officer (JPO) positions with the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), typically in the range of 6 to 10 new posts, and with 
the International Organization for Migration (IOM), usually 1 new JPO 
position annually. If confirmed, I will work with our colleagues inside 
the U.S. Government and through external partners to explore ways to 
contribute to this important program.

    Question. Nicaragua has one of the lowest rates of voting 
coincidence with the U.S. in the U.N. General Assembly and in the 
Security Council. What is your assessment of this issue?

    Answer. While we maintain a range of bilateral communication with 
the Ortega-Murillo regime, it has repeatedly taken actions inconsistent 
with our hemisphere's commitment to democracy and has chosen to isolate 
itself. The Ortega-Murillo regime has gone to great length to align 
itself with authoritarian leaders in countries such as Russia and the 
PRC to stifle the democratic aspirations of its people, which accounts 
for its low rate of voting coincidence with the United States.

    Question. If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to 
engage with the Nicaraguans on anticipated votes in the U.N. system 
that would increase their voting coincidence with the U.S.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau to identify opportunities to demarche the 
Nicaraguan Government when appropriate and to identify interlocutors 
with credibility within the regime we can enlist to persuade the 
Government to vote with the United States in the U.N. system.

    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Managua?

    Answer. Mission Managua operates under a variety of constraints due 
to tension in our bilateral relationship over democracy and human 
rights issues. Due to ongoing repression, many Nicaraguans who would 
normally welcome engagement with the Embassy are afraid to meet with 
U.S. officials. Travel in and out of Nicaragua has been expensive and 
especially cumbersome due to unusual requirements established for 
airlines by the Nicaraguan Government. The Nicaraguan government's 
decision to not reveal real statistics regarding the pandemic's trends 
and impacts made managing COVID especially challenging for Mission 
Managua. Nonetheless, Mission morale remains high and thanks to the 
deep commitment of our staff to promoting peaceful, democratic change, 
to protecting American citizens, and to defending other essential U.S. 
interests. Post management has worked with the Community Liaison Office 
to create opportunities for our Mission personnel and their families to 
manage stress and build a strong community.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Managua?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to working closely with each 
member of the Embassy Managua team--to understand the skills they bring 
to our mission and ensure they understand how their role supports our 
strategic objectives. In previous postings, I have had considerable 
success building trust and strong connections with my team members, and 
teaching supervisors how to do the same with their direct reports. 
Through active listening and constant communication, we have been able 
to empower employees to achieve great outcomes, while also establishing 
a solid sense of how people are doing--an early-warning system for 
potential morale challenges. Working with my Deputy Chief of Mission, I 
intend to prioritize morale throughout the Mission: a happy team is a 
creative, energized, and productive team. I will also work with Bureau 
and Department leadership to convey their support for Embassy Managua's 
hard work in difficult circumstances.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Managua?

    Answer. If confirmed, I intend to ensure every team member at 
Embassy Managua understands how his or her work connects to our 
mission: promoting accountability for the regime and its enablers who 
have undermined democracy and violated the human rights of Nicaraguans. 
I will communicate our operational priorities and our strategic vision 
continuously, in individual meetings with team members, in Country Team 
meetings and town halls, and in my policy speeches. Further, if 
confirmed I will ensure the Embassy Managua team understands the 
broader goals of the Biden-Harris Administration and the Department, 
and how their work contributes to that effort.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. My management style closely aligns with the Servant 
Leadership model, and I am a trained executive coach and long-time 
mentor. I start by building trust through regular one-on-one meetings 
with individual team members, aimed at opening communications, reducing 
barriers, and getting to know employees' strengths and aspirations. 
With these connections and understanding, I can offer support as my 
employees tackle challenges, and I can target professional development 
opportunities where they will have the greatest impact. Trust also 
creates space for empowerment and an atmosphere of candor, generally 
allowing me to recognize and address performance or personnel issues 
early, when they are easier to solve with simple course corrections. I 
teach my supervisors and team leaders this model and hold them 
accountable for building the same trust-based atmosphere with their 
direct reports.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No, it is never acceptable or constructive to berate 
subordinates, either in public or private. If confirmed, I would treat 
all colleagues with respect and civility, as I have done throughout my 
professional career.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. Over the last several years, I have had the honor of being 
involved in the selection of the DCMs and Principal Officers chosen to 
serve across the Western Hemisphere. These men and women bring a wealth 
of experience and talents to these leadership jobs. If confirmed, my 
leadership relationship with my Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) would be 
close, collegial, and collaborative, based on trust and continuous 
communication. As a one-time DCM myself, I valued the Ambassador's 
trust and the benefit of his experience in my own professional 
development. With respect to my DCM, I hope to work closely to 
understand her strengths and then divide up responsibilities with an 
eye to preparing her to lead her own Mission as an Ambassador in the 
not-too-distant future.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. Embassy Managua will be blessed to have a DCM with deep 
previous experience in operations and talent management, as well as 
significant time as Acting DCM in two previous postings. If confirmed, 
I currently envision my DCM taking the lead in the day-to-day 
management of the Mission, but I also hope to keep her involved in 
policy-making decisions. She is a gifted diplomat, and in my absence, I 
want her to be prepared and empowered to run the Mission (and run her 
own Embassy in the future).

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking. Do 
you believe that it is important to provide employees with accurate, 
constructive feedback on their performances in order to encourage 
improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their roles?

    Answer. Yes. I believe it is critical to provide employees with 
accurate, constructive, and timely feedback on their performance, 
including but beyond the EER process. This empowers employees to take 
action in areas in which they need to develop and to continue practices 
at which they excel. Professional development, along with recognizing 
and rewarding employee successes, also contributes to morale and 
retention efforts.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees to improve performance and 
reward high achievers. If confirmed, I would adopt this approach with 
those I supervise and set this expectation for all managers throughout 
the Embassy.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Nicaragua. In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our 
embassy walls enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. U.S. diplomats in Nicaragua actively engage with actors 
across Nicaraguan society and with international partners to advance 
U.S. priorities in Nicaragua. They face unique challenges given the 
Ortega-Murillo regime's rapid closure of civic space, repression of any 
dissenting voices, and surveillance and harassment of key civil society 
activists and political and business leaders. The Embassy must balance 
the benefits of in-person meetings with contacts and the risks such 
meetings pose to the contacts themselves. But our officers have found 
ways to overcome these challenges to maintain key relationships and 
keep their fingers on the pulse of the country.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would support Embassy staff in their 
efforts to access all local populations in ways that do not pose a 
threat to the Nicaraguans with whom they are in contact. I would 
encourage my staff to communicate with Nicaraguan contacts who still 
reside in the country as well as those in exile, and to find creative 
ways to build contact bases.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in the 
Nicaragua?

    Answer. The public diplomacy environment in Nicaragua presents a 
significant challenge to our Mission, given the regime continues to 
close the few remaining democratic spaces. Nicaragua's Foreign Agents 
Law limits regular foreign assistance funding to local civil society 
organizations. The Nicaraguan regime closed more than 1,000 NGOs in 
2022 alone, which includes some of our implementing partners on the 
ground. Despite these challenges, U.S. Embassy Managua manages robust 
public diplomacy efforts to maintain engagement with the Nicaraguan 
public, build strong relationships with civil society, and support the 
Nicaraguan people through active English language programs, support for 
independent journalists, and professional exchange programs.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. U.S. diplomats in Nicaragua face challenges in combatting 
Ortega-Murillo regime disinformation. The Ortega-Murillo regime 
attempts to consolidate its control over Nicaraguan media and civil 
society by imprisoning journalists, forcing them into exile, and 
shutting down most of the independent media outlets. In 2020, the 
Nicaraguan regime passed a Foreign Agents Act, sometimes referred to as 
``Putin's Law,'' which actively prevents local civil society from 
receiving foreign assistance, a standard and critical role of Public 
Affairs Sections in the field. Finally, harassment of U.S. exchange 
program participants continues. Participants risk bullying at the 
airport and even confiscation of their passports.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. Through constant discussion and collaboration, we speak 
with a unified voice across all levels of the Department--from 
Washington to the field. If confirmed, I will continue to advocate in 
support of human rights, democracy, and those who courageously work to 
protect and defend these principles. The Embassy makes great efforts to 
protect the identity and wellbeing of the victims of human rights 
abuses, as well as to preserve the ability to continue its work to 
promote human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Department also 
coordinates closely with Embassy Managua to ensure unified messages 
that advance U.S. public diplomacy goals in Nicaragua.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel. If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat 
seriously?

    Answer. Yes. I take nothing more seriously than the well-being and 
security of the people who work with me. The interagency community 
continues its examination of a range of hypotheses. Secretary Blinken 
has prioritized the Department's response to AHIs, setting clear goals 
for the Health Incident Response Task Force to strengthen the 
Department's communication with its workforce and providing care for 
affected employees and family members.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Managua personnel?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will take nothing more seriously than 
the health and security of the people working at U.S. Embassy Managua 
and commit to regularly talking as openly as possible to Mission 
personnel.

                    follow up questions submitted to
                 hugo f.rodriguez, jr. by senator risch
          Question. In November, the Ortega regime lifted visa 
        requirements for Cuban nationals, in what appears to be an 
        effort to weaponize illegal migration into the United States. 
        In your opinion, do such measures present a national security 
        risk for the United States?

          Answer. The United States is deeply concerned about increased 
        irregular Cuban migration via Nicaragua following the Ortega-
        Murillo regime's elimination of visa requirements for Cuban 
        citizens. We have seen a dramatic increase in the numbers of 
        Cuban irregular migrants crossing the border from Nicaragua to 
        Honduras with the intention of continuing to and irregularly 
        entering the United States. This land route is a dangerous path 
        for migrants seeking a better life. Irregular migration and 
        forced exile put migrants in dire humanitarian situations and 
        affect our entire hemisphere. The United States and the broader 
        region all share an interest in sustainable solutions that 
        humanely reduce irregular migration and forced exile in, from, 
        and through the region.

          Question. Is it in the interest of the United States for 
        Nicaragua to continue to receive benefits under the Dominican 
        Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement? 
        Please explain.

          Answer. The CAFTA-DR remains critical to creating a stable 
        economic environment in Central America and opportunities for 
        the people of the region. The Nicaraguan people have endured 
        significant hardships under Ortega and Murillo, including 
        deteriorating economic and social conditions since the regime 
        began its crackdown in April 2018. In light of the dramatic 
        deterioration of respect for democratic principles in 
        Nicaragua, the United States has taken a number of actions, 
        including withholding support for Nicaraguan government 
        participation in trade capacity-building and technical 
        assistance initiatives and not allocating Nicaragua a sugar 
        tariff-rate quota for 2023. If confirmed, I would support 
        efforts to review the implications of Nicaragua's continued 
        participation in CAFTA-DR.

          Question. If confirmed, would you support a detailed 
        investigation of the assets and holdings of the Nicaraguan 
        Armed Forces in the United States and consider appropriate 
        actions to hold it accountable for gross violations of human 
        rights?

          Answer. If confirmed, I would support a detailed 
        investigation of the assets and holdings of the Nicaraguan 
        Armed Forces in the United States, consistent with applicable 
        law. The United States has already taken steps to promote 
        accountability for the Nicaraguan Armed Forces' role in the 
        Ortega-Murillo regime's repression, imposing sanctions on key 
        members of the Nicaraguan military. On January 10, the U.S. 
        Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control 
        (OFAC) designated six individuals pursuant to Executive Order 
        13851, three of whom are associated with the Nicaraguan Army 
        and the Military Social Welfare Institute (IPSM), the 
        Nicaraguan Army's public investment fund. OFAC's press release 
        accompanying these sanctions recognized that the Nicaraguan 
        Army not only refused to order the dismantling of paramilitary 
        or ``parapolice'' forces during and after political uprisings, 
        but the military also provided weapons to the parapolice who 
        carried out numerous acts of violence against the Nicaraguan 
        people.

          Question. If confirmed, would you support using the tools 
        available under Section 5 of the Nicaragua Human Rights and 
        Anticorruption Act of 2018 (NHRAA) and Executive Order 13851 to 
        target Ortega's Ministry of Governance (Ministerio de 
        Gobernacion) and the National Penitentiary System as 
        institutions directly involved in violations of 
        internationally-recognized human rights in Nicaragua?
          Answer. If confirmed, I would support using the diplomatic 
        and economic tools at our disposal to promote accountability 
        for the Ortega-Murillo regime's repression and human rights 
        abuses. I would work with the embassy team, staff in 
        Washington, and interagency colleagues to consider the 
        appropriateness of applying the tools in the law formerly known 
        as the Nicaragua Human Rights and Anticorruption Act of 2018 
        and Executive Order 13851 to the abuses of the Ministry of 
        Governance and the National Penitentiary System.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
         Submitted to Candace A. Bond by Senator James E. Risch

Democracy and Human Rights
    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Human Rights report, 
Trinidad and Tobago are noted for human rights issues of unlawful 
killings, refoulement of refugees, corruption, and human trafficking. 
The Government took steps to identify, investigate, and prosecute these 
abuses but the persistence of open-ended investigations and the slow 
pace of the justice system left impunity to be an issue.

   What is your assessment of the persistence of these violations?

    Answer. My understanding is that the Government of Trinidad and 
Tobago (GoTT) has yet to convict a single individual under its 2011 
anti-trafficking law. Corruption and official complicity in trafficking 
crimes remain significant concerns, inhibiting law enforcement action. 
Courts are deeply backlogged, often taking five to 10 years to resolve 
cases, including trafficking cases, despite adopting justice system 
reforms in 2019 to address the problem. The judiciary's broad 
discretion and inconsistency in granting bail, as well as reports of 
fraud and corruption within the bail process, engender concomitant 
recidivism, victim re-traumatization, and a perception of impunity.

    Question. If confirmed, what actions would you take with host 
government to address these issues and help the Government become more 
efficient in investigations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will encourage the GoTT to undertake 
concrete steps to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of 
investigations to ensure accountability for human trafficking and other 
related human rights issues. With regard to human trafficking, these 
include efforts to: investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers, 
including complicit officials and staff; ensure victims are not 
penalized for unlawful acts traffickers compelled them to commit; 
strengthen rules and regulations to ensure immigration enforcement does 
not hinder human trafficking detection, criminal law enforcement, or 
victim protections; ensure trafficking is investigated and prosecuted 
to the fullest extent of the law; provide adequate funding for robust 
trafficking investigations and victim services; train law enforcement 
and prosecutors in proactively identifying, obtaining, preserving, and 
corroborating evidence of trafficking; and improve cooperation between 
the Counter Trafficking Unit , prosecutors, the judiciary, and NGOs to 
increase the number of cases that proceed to trial. If confirmed, I 
will also explore programmatic responses to assist the GoTT in 
improving efficiency in investigations such as through the Caribbean 
Basin Security Initiative (CBSI).

    Question. In regards to refugees, many international agencies 
expressed alarm at the response to Venezuelan refugees. How could you 
work with the Trinidad Government to improve the standards of treatment 
for refugees?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will encourage the GoTT to prosecute human 
traffickers, and provide regularization and documentation of Venezuelan 
refugees and migrants living in the country so they may access their 
basic rights and services and reduce their vulnerability to human 
trafficking. I will underscore the importance of humane treatment of 
migrants and refugees, in line with international protection standards.
    I will work with the Government of Trinidad and Tobago to promote 
greater security cooperation and training opportunities for their Coast 
Guard and other border security agencies.
    Finally, if confirmed, I will encourage the GoTT to regularly 
screen this population for human trafficking indicators and refer 
identified victims for adequate services.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons 
report, Trinidad and Tobago remained on the Tier 2 watch list for not 
fully meeting the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, 
but is making significant efforts to do so. The Government has not 
convicted a trafficker under its 2011 anti-trafficking law, corruption 
and official complicity remain concerning in inhibiting law enforcement 
action, and victim identification services have been weak.

   If confirmed, how could you work with the host government to stymie 
        corruption and support law enforcement to take action against 
        traffickers?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will encourage the Government of Trinidad 
and Tobago to increase efforts to investigate, prosecute, and convict 
traffickers--including complicit officials and staff--and ensure 
trafficking is investigated and prosecuted using the anti-trafficking 
law and not as other or lesser crimes.

    Question. What steps would you take to encourage the host 
government to improve victim identification procedures and services?

    Answer. As noted in the 2022 TIP Report, victim identification and 
services in Trinidad and Tobago remains weak. If confirmed, I will 
encourage the Government to: increase proactive victim identification, 
screening, and protection among vulnerable communities, including 
migrants, asylum-seekers, and refugees, especially Venezuelans; ensure 
victims are not penalized for unlawful acts traffickers compelled them 
to commit; strengthen rules and regulations to ensure immigration 
enforcement does not hinder human trafficking detection, criminal law 
enforcement, or victim protections; implement a formalized protocol and 
a functioning and active coordinating committee for victim care; 
improve the quality of victim care--especially for children--and 
increase bilingual services; approve, fund, and implement the anti-
trafficking NAP for 2021-2023; and provide adequate funding for robust 
trafficking investigations and victim services, including 
accommodations; and increase trauma-informed training on trafficking 
for NGO, shelter, social services, and law enforcement staff to improve 
their ability to identify and care for potential trafficking victims.

    Question. The Government did not formally adopt a National Action 
Plan for 2021-2023, if confirmed, how could you urge the Government to 
adopt a NAP?

    Answer. National Action Plans are an important component of the 
fight against human trafficking. If confirmed, I will encourage the 
Government to approve, fund, and implement the anti-trafficking NAP for 
2021-2023.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, Trinidad's constitution provides for freedom of 
conscience and religious belief or practice. US officials have engaged 
the Government on the importance of religious freedom and tolerance and 
funded programs in support of interfaith communication and cooperation.

   What is your assessment of these efforts?

    Answer. Trinidad and Tobago is a stable multi-cultural and multi-
religious democracy. The U.S. Embassy in Trinidad and Tobago works to 
advance religious freedom and tolerance for religious diversity through 
engagement with multi-faith communities, individual faith leaders, and 
religious groups. This work helps strengthen interfaith understanding 
of religious freedom and ensures that citizens continue to coexist 
peacefully as they have since Trinidad and Tobago's independence. If 
confirmed, I will stand by the Trinbagonian peoples' right to freedom 
of religion or belief and ensure the Embassy continues to work to 
address issues related to the discrimination of religious minorities 
and other disenfranchised communities.

    Question. If confirmed, how could you build upon these engagements 
and programs to continue to improve the standing of religious freedom 
and tolerance in the country?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with my Embassy team, the 
Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom (IRF), and 
other stakeholders to ensure robust engagement with all faith 
communities and credible inter-faith groups to advance religious 
freedom and tolerance. Proper monitoring and evaluation of existing 
programs will guide needed adjustments or changes to existing 
programming.

International Organizations
    Question. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the U.N., including in elections 
for specialized bodies like the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who if 
elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. 
She is in a tough race that will require early, consistent engagement 
across capitals and within the U.N. member states.

   If confirmed, do you commit to demarching the Trinidad Government 
        and any other counterparts necessary to encourage their support 
        of Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. If confirmed, how can you work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify, recruit, 
and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior Program 
Officer (JPO) program at the U.N.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the State Department's 
Bureau for International Organizations to identify qualified candidates 
for the program by engaging civil society organizations and government 
officers on issues of great importance in Trinidad and Tobago, 
including but not limited to human rights, climate change, and drugs 
and crime.

    Question. Trinidad and Tobago has a low rate of voting coincidence 
with the U.S. in the U.N. General Assembly and in the Security Council.

   What is your assessment of this issue?

    Answer. In 2020, Trinidad and Tobago had a 24 percent voting 
coincidence with the United States, reflecting the views of many 
Caribbean Community (CARICOM) member states, which tend to vote as a 
block. If confirmed, I will engage the highest level of the GoTT to 
explain U.S. multilateral positions and strive to improve voting 
coincidence, better reflecting our shared values.

    Question. If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to 
engage with the Trinidad Government on anticipated votes in the U.N. 
system that would increase their voting coincidence with the U.S.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will engage the Government on shared values 
and interests to try to seek alignment in the U.N. system. I will lobby 
the GoTT regularly in advance of critical votes and work to ensure 
coordination in the U.N. and other multilateral fora.

State Department Manangement and Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID.

   What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission Port of 
        Spain?

    Answer. I understand that COVID-19 has caused considerable stress 
for U.S. Embassy personnel--both Americans and locally employed staff, 
and their families. In many instances, the pandemic has exacerbated 
preexisting challenges such as staffing shortages. COVID-19 continues 
to pose significant concerns for U.S. Embassy staff and their families 
as less than 52 percent of Trinidad and Tobago's population is fully 
vaccinated and the country is dealing with new variants that increase 
susceptibility to the pandemic. Notwithstanding these challenges, I 
understand that Embassy staff continue to work diligently to advance 
U.S. foreign policy goals. If confirmed, I will make taking care of our 
employees my first priority, while ensuring they have the necessary 
resources and support to efficiently and effectively perform their 
jobs.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Port of 
Spain?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will improve morale at U.S. Embassy Port of 
Spain by implementing a collaborative leadership approach in which I 
actively listen to the views and analyses of my staff on foreign policy 
and workplace issues, provide training to all employees on cross-
cultural communication and leadership, and engage the Government of 
Trinidad and Tobago to advance progress on issues that most affect 
employee morale, such as timely receipt of value added tax 
reimbursements and the establishment of a diplomatic post office.
    One of my priorities will be to finalize the process to start 
construction on a new embassy compound (NEC). U.S. Mission Port of 
Spain has one of the oldest embassies in the region as it was built and 
opened in the 1960s. A NEC would significantly improve staff morale. If 
confirmed, I will work diligently to ensure that vacant positions in 
the Embassy are filled, and our staffing reflects our bilateral 
priorities. I will also continue to advocate with the Government of 
Trinidad and Tobago to accredit same-sex spouses of U.S. diplomats and 
administrative and technical staff to ensure the Embassy is able to 
attract the best and brightest U.S. Government employees who are 
currently excluded from serving in Trinidad and Tobago with their 
families.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Port of Spain?

    Answer. The morale, well-being, and safety of all mission employees 
will be one of my top priorities as Ambassador, if confirmed. I intend 
to create a unified mission and vision for U.S. Embassy Port of Spain 
by clearly and consistently articulating the priority U.S. foreign 
policy goals that our post will work diligently to accomplish, empower 
my staff to lead and take ownership of accomplishing those goals, 
frequently review our progress in advancing U.S. foreign policy goals 
in Trinidad and Tobago, and when necessary, amend and modify our 
strategies and tactics to ensure we implement innovative, coherent, and 
sensible approaches commensurate with Embassy resources to achieve U.S. 
foreign policy goals.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I would describe my management style as consultative with 
open communication. I believe good leadership is rooted in 
collaboration and I am committed to the ongoing development of my 
staff. If confirmed, I will seek to identify what motivates each 
employee so as to identify their strengths and weaknesses and help them 
to become better professionals.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No. It is never acceptable or constructive to berate a 
subordinate, in public or in private. I believe such conduct is 
antithetical to creating a positive and productive workplace.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will implement and sustain a collaborative 
leadership relationship with the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM). I will 
ensure that I work closely with my DCM to explain and share my vision 
with staff to advance U.S. foreign policy goals, maintain strong 
workplace morale, and provide the necessary resources and support so 
that our employees efficiently and effectively perform their jobs. The 
key to the close, collaborative leadership relationship that I will 
sustain with my DCM, if confirmed, will be constant and consistent 
communication. I will hold regular and frequent meetings to make sure 
the DCM understands my vision and goals, and we articulate and execute 
our leadership and management of the embassy based on the values of a 
united, collaborative, one-mission/one-team effort.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will entrust my Deputy Chief of Mission 
(DCM) to be responsible for managing the daily operations of the 
embassy, while I serve as the U.S. Government's lead interlocutor with 
the people and Government of Trinidad and Tobago to advance U.S. 
foreign policy and public diplomacy goals. I will clearly articulate my 
leadership and management vision and goals for the embassy to the DCM 
and she/he will make sure to execute them in close collaboration with 
the managers of sections and U.S. interagency offices working in 
Trinidad and Tobago. Throughout my professional career, I have 
maintained an open-door policy with my staff. I will continue to do so 
with the DCM and Embassy employees. Finally, if confirmed, I will 
consistently remind the DCM that taking care of our employees should 
always be our first priority, while ensuring they have the necessary 
resources and support to efficiently and effectively perform their 
jobs.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Yes. I believe it is important to provide all employees 
with accurate and constructive feedback. It is essential to their 
professional development, and I am committed to making that a hallmark 
of my service in Trinidad and Tobago, if confirmed.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes. I believe clear, accurate, and direct feedback is 
essential to the management of all employees. I want to ensure everyone 
on our team is contributing to our success. That is only possible if 
everyone receives the feedback they require.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Trinidad and Tobago.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. I understand U.S. diplomats meet contacts outside the 
embassy and assess local conditions despite the difficulties associated 
with the pandemic. If confirmed, I will encourage Embassy staff to 
continue to get beyond the walls as often as we can, within the bounds 
of safety.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I plan to get out as much as possible, to 
share U.S. views and listen to concerns, and to highlight the great 
programs that the U.S. Government is conducting in Trinidad and Tobago. 
If confirmed, I will encourage embassy staff to interact with local 
populations from all walks of life.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in 
Trinidad and Tobago?

    Answer. The law of Trinidad and Tobago provides for a high degree 
of freedom of expression, including for members of the press and other 
media. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning 
democratic political system combine to promote freedom of expression, 
including for members of the media. Advertising supports the news 
outlets in Trinidad and Tobago, and, with the exception of Trinidad and 
Tobago Television (TTT), all claim to be politically independent. TTT 
Limited is a state-owned enterprise launched in August 2018 by Prime 
Minister Dr. Keith Rowley. Trinbagonians enjoy a high degree of 
literacy and the public regularly engages in robust political debate. 
The Embassy maintains a social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, and 
Instagram, with content on each tailored to specific audiences that 
follow each platform.
    The Embassy provides grants to NGOs in support of the Mission's 
Integrated Country Strategy (ICS) goals, including to support 
education, at-risk youth, marginalized populations, and persons with 
disabilities. The Embassy's Public Affairs Section encourages 
Trinbagonian students to pursue higher education in the United States 
through EducationUSA and an American Center that offers resources for 
standardized testing, college selection, and pursuing scholarships.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. The local press is free but tends to favor sensational 
journalism. Journalists are sometimes sloppy in pursuit of being the 
first to write a story. This makes it more challenging for the U.S. 
Embassy to control its narrative in the press as journalists 
occasionally misquote or misrepresent the United States' position. 
However, the United States and the bilateral relationship enjoy a high 
degree of attention among Trinbagonians and the media, and many U.S. 
policies receive positive press coverage. In addition, combatting the 
misinformation campaign currently undertaken by the PRC remains an 
issue of paramount importance.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. I understand the State Department's bureaus and overseas 
missions work hand-in-hand on public diplomacy. In doing so, they 
create messaging about key policy priorities that resonate with the 
local audience and design educational and cultural programs that 
further U.S. goals of economic growth, respect for human rights, 
strengthening civil society, protecting the environment, and embracing 
diversity.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will take nothing more seriously than 
the health and security of the people who will work with me.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Port of Spain personnel?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I commit to speaking as openly as 
possible to mission personnel and working with health and security 
officials as recommended to establish and maintain appropriate 
protocols and ensure a healthy working environment for both Americans 
and local staff.



                               __________


            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
          Submitted to Candace A. Bond by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. It should be clear to everyone in this administration 
that the Chinese Communist Party is the most comprehensive military, 
economic and political threat our nation faces today. Right now, in 
Latin America and the Caribbean, it is working to undermine our 
interests and our allies, whether that's by supplying the fentanyl 
smuggled across our open border or assisting dictators that continue to 
drive people to emigrate to the U.S.

   Is the Chinese Communist Party a threat to the United States?

    Answer. Certain People's Republic of China (PRC) and Chinese 
Communist Party activities represent a threat to U.S. interests in the 
region, particularly in terms of investments in critical infrastructure 
and sensitive sectors such as transportation facilities and 
telecommunication projects.
    As Secretary Blinken said on May 26, the United States must invest, 
align, and compete with the PRC to defend our interests and build our 
vision for the future. If confirmed, I will invest in our partnership 
with Trinidad and Tobago, highlight the risks associated with PRC 
engagement that could impact Trinidad and Tobago's security and 
sovereignty and U.S. interests, and ensure that our vision of a 
positive partnership and regional security and prosperity competes 
successfully with the PRC.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to stop the expansion of 
the CCP's influence in Trinidad and Tobago?

    Answer. Trinidad and Tobago exports seven times more to the United 
States than China. In addition to our significant trade relationship, 
Trinidad and Tobago cooperates bilaterally with the United States on 
counter-narcotics trafficking, by way of intelligence sharing of 
origin, transit, and destination information. These are the strong 
foundations on which our bilateral relationship is built. If confirmed, 
I will continue to encourage bilateral cooperation on trade and drug 
trafficking and will continue to promote shared democratic values.

    Question. Crime is one of the major problems facing Trinidad and 
Tobago. Last year, the homicide rate in Trinidad and Tobago was the 4th 
highest in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the homicide rate 
actually increased by 12 percent last year. If we truly want to help 
the people of Trinidad and Tobago deal with the scourge of violent 
crime, we need a U.S. Ambassador that fully committed to commonsense 
solutions.

   Do you now, or have you ever, supported the Defund the Police 
        movement?

    Answer. No. I share your concern regarding rising violence and 
insecurity in Trinidad and Tobago. If confirmed, I will work to 
strengthen the partnership between the United States and the Trinidad 
and Tobago Police Service through the Caribbean Basin Security 
Initiative (CBSI). Strengthening law enforcement and the justice 
system, through activities like incorporating forensic evidence and 
case management, remains crucial to Trinidad and Tobago's ability to 
interdict narcotics and manage evidence to prosecute crimes, which 
supports U.S. national interests.

    Question. Do you believe Trinidad and Tobago's crime rates can be 
solved with less police and less law enforcement assistance from the 
United States?

    Answer. No. Through CBSI, the United States provides critical 
support to Trinidad and Tobago to fight corruption and strengthen 
police services screening. Technical assistance from the Bureau of 
International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL), in addition to 
critical support from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the 
Department of Defense, help disrupt the flow of narcotics to the United 
States and have resulted in the seizure of large amounts of illicit 
narcotics, especially cocaine. Combined with INL's community policing 
efforts, and the recent deployment of U.S. Alcohol, Tobacco, and 
Firearms (ATF) personnel to T&T, our assistance is making a decisive 
difference in helping combat crime in Trinidad and Tobago.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to support Trinidadian 
efforts to counter violent crime?

    Answer. In addition to the aforementioned CBSI programming, I 
understand that the United States Agency for International Development 
(USAID) implements essential programming to assist at-risk youth and 
reforming the juvenile justice in Trinidad and Tobago as part of CBSI. 
If confirmed, I will continue to support CBSI assistance, and work to 
expand this programming.

    Question. Due to its location just off the coast of Venezuela, 
Trinidad and Tobago are one of the few countries that did not break 
relations with the despotic regime of Nicolas Maduro. Some of this is 
practical--there are issues that Trinidad and Tobago simply have to 
work with Maduro on, like a shared maritime border--but the Rowley 
Government has called for lifting sanctions and joint development of 
oil and gas with the regime.

   Is it still the policy of the U.S. Government not to recognize 
        Nicolas Maduro as the President of Venezuela?

    Answer. The United States continues to recognize Juan Guaid? as 
Interim President and the 2015 National Assembly as the last national 
democratic institution in Venezuela.

    Question. Is it still the policy of the United States to hold 
Maduro accountable for his crimes against the people of Venezuela?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will support holding accountable actors 
that engage in corruption, violate U.S. laws, or abuse human rights in 
connection with Venezuela. Free and fair elections are paramount to 
stability in the region.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to encourage Trinidad and 
Tobago to align with the U.S. stance towards Nicolas Maduro?

    Answer. The United States will continue to work with the 
international community to promote substantive, credible advancements 
to restore democratic processes and institutions in Venezuela. If 
confirmed, I will work with Trinidad and Tobago to continue seeking 
opportunities to engage in spaces that focus on improving the lives of 
Venezuelans.

    Question. Trinidad and Tobago is currently struggling to revitalize 
its economy as it emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic. You ended your 
written testimony by ``pledging to dedicate your skills and energy to 
strengthen our diplomatic and economic ties to Trinidad and Tobago, 
advance U.S. interests in the world and to promote American democratic 
values.'' Many Trinidadians reside in New York and Florida and have 
links to families back home. If confirmed, what's your message to these 
Trinidadian-Americans?

    Answer. The Department of State has no greater priority than the 
protection of the lives and interests of U.S. citizens abroad. My 
message to Trinbagonian-Americans is that I value the deep and 
extensive cultural and familial ties between the United States and the 
twin islands. If confirmed, I will continue to encourage participation 
for Trinidad and Tobago's civil society, government, and military 
leaders in Department of State-sponsored professional development 
exchanges to share best practices and build closer ties with U.S. 
counterparts and institutions. I will also advocate on behalf of 
American businesses, including those with linkages to the diaspora, to 
compete for opportunities in Trinidad and Tobago.

    Question. How will you strengthen our existing relations with 
Trinidad and Tobago?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work to increase public-private 
partnerships and investment in Trinidad and Tobago. A strong economic 
relationship is a hallmark of strong relations, and I will encourage 
U.S. investment. If confirmed, I will also seek to strengthen 
institutions and policies that help us achieve common goals of economic 
and political partnerships.

    Question. What is Trinidad and Tobago's post-recovery plan?

    Answer. Trinidad and Tobago experienced record numbers of new 
infections and deaths in 2021 and declining economic activity due to 
public health restrictions and global conditions during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Trinidad and Tobago's Ministry of Planning and Development 
created the ``Roadmap for Trinidad and Tobago Post-COVID-19 Pandemic,'' 
which defines priority actions to address and mitigate the pandemic's 
economic impact, restart the economy, and lay a foundation for 
sustained economic recovery. While the Government continues to 
implement these recommendations, current record global energy prices 
indicate Trinidad and Tobago should experience economic growth in 2022 
for the first time since 2015.

    Question. How has the United States assisted in this recovery?

    Answer. The United States donated nearly 685,000 doses of the 
Pfizer vaccine to Trinidad and Tobago. The United States also donated 
field hospitals, ventilators, and other medical supplies. The United 
States remains Trinidad and Tobago's top trading partner and number one 
destination for its energy exports, which generates most of the 
country's export revenue. U.S. private sector technology, services, and 
machinery power Trinidad and Tobago's industrial base.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
         Submitted to Heide B. Fulton by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Human Rights report, 
Uruguay was noted for having harsh and potentially life-threatening 
conditions in its prison and detention facilities across the country. 
Despite that, the Government has taken steps to identify and punish 
officials who commit human rights abuses, and there were no reports of 
impunity.

   What is your assessment of the effectiveness of these efforts by 
        the Government?

    Answer. Uruguay enjoys an overall positive human rights record and 
has a strong international reputation as a leader on international law 
and democracy. The country has an independent press, an effective 
judiciary, low levels of corruption, and a functioning democratic 
political system. Uruguay established the National Institution for 
Human Rights (INDDHH) in 2008 to defend, protect, and promote human 
rights.
    The Human Rights Report identifies prison conditions as an area of 
concern, with approximately one-third of Uruguay's prison facilities 
considered substandard, and the overall prison population high and 
growing. The Government of Uruguay recognizes the improvements needed 
in prisons and detention facilities and is taking steps to build new 
prisons and renovate existing facilities. Uruguay has a special 
rapporteur on the prison system, who advises parliament on compliance 
with prison legislation and international standards, monitors prison 
conditions, and provides in-depth, independent analysis of the prison 
situation. Embassy Montevideo works closely with that rapporteur and 
entities throughout the Government to support their efforts to improve 
prison conditions. In July, a group of officials traveled to the United 
States to learn from U.S. prison reform experiences. Uruguay's strong 
institutions, efficient and independent justice system, and low levels 
of corruption help prevent impunity for human rights violations within 
prisons.

    Question. If confirmed, what actions would you take with the host 
government to address the conditions in prison facilities?

    Answer. The State Department has engaged with the Government and 
parliament on prison reform, including a program over the past two 
years to connect Uruguayan officials with experts in the United States 
for virtual exchanges on justice issues, including prison reform. If 
confirmed, I look forward to bringing my experience as the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Programs in the 
Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs to 
further our work on this important issue. If confirmed, I will also 
support the ongoing efforts to support the Government of Uruguay's 
efforts to improve prison conditions and outcomes and will raise this 
issue in my interactions with Uruguayan Government officials.

    Question. How could you work with the Government to continue to 
build on and improve the country's human rights record?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will look for ways to address the issues 
raised in the Human Rights Report, including prison conditions as well 
as gender-based violence and discrimination against vulnerable groups 
such as afro-descendants, persons with disabilities, women, and the 
LGBTQI+ population. Uruguay has a historically strong, democratic 
governance structure and a positive record of upholding political 
rights and civil liberties, and our work on these issues are respectful 
exchanges between two countries striving to perfect the promise of 
democracy and rule of law for their entire populations. Embassy 
Montevideo also engages frequently with civil society organizations on 
a broad range of issues, especially human rights. If confirmed, I will 
work to support those civil society organizations working on human 
rights, including through exchanges with the United States. Given 
Uruguay's strong human rights record, if confirmed I will also 
encourage Uruguay to serve as a model in the hemisphere and to share 
its experiences with other countries in the region.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons 
report, Uruguay remained a Tier 2 country for not fully meeting the 
minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, but is making 
significant efforts to do so. However, the Government has failed to 
provide adequate victim services or consistent access to shelters, law 
enforcement did not proactively and systematically identify victims, 
and the country's National Action Plan expired without replacement.

   If confirmed, how could you encourage the host government to 
        improve upon victim services and access to shelters?

    Answer. Uruguay remains a source, transit, and destination country 
for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex 
trafficking. Uruguay has been designated as a Tier 2 country in the 
Trafficking in Persons Report since 2015. Civil society organizations 
have expressed concern about the suitability of the facilities where 
the Government of Uruguay lodges trafficking victims and reported 
challenges finding shelter for some trafficking victims. If confirmed, 
I and my team will engage with Uruguayan officials to encourage the 
Government to make provision for adequate shelter and services, 
including daytime programming, whether directly or through partnerships 
with civil society organizations.

    Question. What steps would you take to help enhance law 
enforcement's ability to identify victims?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will actively engage the Government of 
Uruguay on victims' identification, prosecution of perpetrators, and 
comprehensive victims' assistance. In my interactions with government 
officials, if confirmed, I will highlight the recommendations from the 
Trafficking in Persons report, including increased efforts to identify 
victims of forced labor and sex trafficking; proactive screening to 
detect trafficking indicators among vulnerable populations; providing 
specialized services and shelter for all victims; and increasing 
training for law enforcement officials, labor inspectors, coast guard 
officers, prosecutors, judges, and social workers to understand human 
trafficking.

    Question. How could you urge the Government to replace its expired 
NAP?

    Answer. The Government has not renewed or replaced its national 
action plan to combat trafficking since its expiration at the end of 
2020. If confirmed, I will continue Embassy Montevideo's engagement 
with Uruguayan officials to encourage the Government to approve and 
implement a new national action plan to combat trafficking in persons. 
The Embassy has promoted engagement between U.S. and Uruguayan 
authorities that helped improve communication and understanding between 
our governments on this issue, and if confirmed I will work to increase 
these kinds of exchanges. If confirmed, I will also look for 
opportunities to bring non-governmental experts from the United States 
to Uruguay to increase awareness of TIP and share best practices among 
government and civil society experts.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, Uruguay's constitution provides for freedom of religion 
and affirms the state does not endorse any specific religion. The 
commitment to secularism has created some controversy between religious 
and political leaders. US officials have engaged the Government on its 
interpretation of secularism, and worked on creating a Uruguayan 
Government counterpart for religious issues.

   What is your assessment of these efforts?

    Answer. Uruguay's strong human rights record and international 
reputation as a leader on human rights also extends to religious 
freedom. Uruguay's constitution provides for religious freedom and 
discrimination based on religion is prohibited. The International 
Religious Freedom report for Uruguay raises some issues around the 
interpretation of secularism, however, as some religious groups said 
government authorities sometimes interpreted secularism as the absence 
of religion, rather than as the coexistence of multiple religions and 
the independence of religion from the state. Religious organizations 
also encourage the establishment of more channels of communication with 
the Government to discuss issues related to religious freedom.

    Question. If confirmed, how could you work with political and 
religious leaders to increase cooperation amongst the groups?

    Answer. Embassy Montevideo has taken important steps to bring 
together a range of religious leaders, as well as academics, lawyers, 
and human rights experts, to discuss interfaith collaboration and to 
hear concerns about faith-related issues. These conversations help 
bring attention to the importance of religious coexistence and 
interfaith dialogue in Uruguay, and if confirmed I will continue these 
dialogues.

    Question. What steps could you take to help the country establish a 
governmental counterpart to take responsibility of religious issues?

    Answer. Embassy Montevideo officials have raised with government 
officials the issues highlighted in the International Religious Freedom 
report, including the Government's interpretation of secularism, and 
establishing a government counterpart for religious issues, and 
encouraged government representatives to engage in dialogue with 
religious groups. If confirmed, I will continue to raise these issues 
in my conversations with government officials to reinforce their 
importance.

    Question. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the U.N., including in elections 
for specialized bodies like the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who if 
elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. 
She is in a tough race that will require early, consistent engagement 
across capitals and within the U.N. member states.

   If confirmed, do you commit to demarching the Uruguayan Government 
        and any other counterparts necessary to encourage their support 
        of Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. Yes, I commit to demarching the Uruguayan Government to 
encourage support for Ms. Bogdan's candidacy, if confirmed. Secretary 
Blinken publicly endorsed Ms. Bogdan-Martin's candidacy in March 2021. 
If confirmed, I will work closely with the Bureau of International 
Organization Affairs to support Ms. Bogdan-Martin's candidacy and 
encourage Uruguay to vote for her for ITU Secretary-General, as well as 
the candidacies of other U.S. candidates endorsed by the Department to 
fill critical positions at the U.N. and its specialized bodies. Embassy 
Montevideo has engaged Government of Uruguay counterparts in support of 
Ms. Bogdan-Martin, including both demarches and facilitating 
conversations with the candidate, and if confirmed I will continue that 
engagement as the vote approaches.

    Question. If confirmed, how can you work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify, recruit, 
and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior Program 
Officer (JPO) program at the U.N.?

    Answer. I am committed to increasing the representation of 
independent, qualified U.S. citizens in international organizations. If 
confirmed, I will work actively with the IO bureau and other 
stakeholders to assist in identifying, recruiting, and installing more 
U.S. officials in positions at the U.N., including Junior Professional 
Officer (JPO) positions.

    Question. Uruguay has a low rate of voting coincidence with the 
U.S. in the U.N. General Assembly and in the Security Council.

   What is your assessment of this issue?

    Answer. Uruguay is a respected member of many international 
organizations and cooperates with the United States on issues such as 
strengthening international peacekeeping and promoting human rights. 
Uruguay strongly believes in multilateralism and dialogue to achieve 
international peace and security and is among the world's top troop 
contributing countries to U.N. peacekeeping operations per capita and 
is the top in Latin America.
    Uruguay has a lower voting coincidence with the United States in 
the U.N. General Assembly than the global average, similar to the 
voting coincidence of other countries in Latin America. In 2020, 
however, Uruguay's voting coincidence rose significantly and was above 
the region's average. Uruguay has voted repeatedly to condemn Russia's 
invasion of Ukraine and voted to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human 
Rights Council. If confirmed, I will work to build on this positive 
trend and further align our positions in the U.N. and other 
multilateral bodies.

    Question. If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to 
engage with the Uruguayan Government on anticipated votes in the U.N. 
system that would increase their voting coincidence with the U.S.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will strive for early, consistent, and 
high-level engagement with Government of Uruguay officials on critical 
votes in U.N. bodies, to convey the U.S. position and encourage 
alignment with Uruguay.

    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID.

   What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission Montevideo?

    Answer. Like all our missions around the world, Embassy Montevideo 
faced challenges in 2020 and 2021 in responding to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Through its policy of ``responsible liberty,'' the Government 
of Uruguay did not impose the strict lockdowns seen in other countries 
and was largely successful in navigating the pandemic. I understand 
that Embassy morale has been resilient through these challenges and 
remains strong.
    I understand that Embassy Montevideo has been undergoing a major 
renovation since 2018 that has had an impact on morale. Embassy 
employees were not relocated to a new work site and are working in the 
Chancery during the continued construction, leading to loud noise, 
odors, dust, and other construction-related issues for staff.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission 
Montevideo?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will solicit feedback from Embassy 
Montevideo personnel directly on factors that are having an impact on 
morale and take steps to address them. I also plan, if confirmed, to 
hold town hall forums and one-on-one meetings to listen to and engage 
with our employees, including our Locally Employed Staff. If confirmed, 
I look forward to building on the work of my predecessors to celebrate 
and reward the accomplishments of our Embassy Montevideo team and to 
support and strengthen the important work of our Community Liaison 
Office.
    Related to the rehabilitation project, if confirmed I will work 
with the Overseas Building Operations and Diplomatic Security to 
explore ways to minimize the impact on Embassy morale of the ongoing 
construction work, including alternative work sites to allow work to 
proceed free of the construction-related noise, odors, and dust.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Montevideo?

    Answer. My leadership and management style are informed by my 
formation as an Army officer. I believe in setting a clear direction in 
our priorities, establishing left and right limits, and then providing 
the resources my team needs to achieve our goals. I support this 
approach through my style of frequent, open communication to ensure 
understanding about the intent of our objectives and to work through 
challenges as they arise. In my experience, clear direction, support, 
and open communication forge strong teams.
    I will also reinforce the integrated country strategy (ICS) 
objectives for Embassy Montevideo, which incorporate the input of the 
sections and agencies present in Uruguay, to align and unify our 
objectives across the entire mission.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I take management seriously and carry out my management 
style outlined above: set a clear direction, establish parameters, and 
provide necessary resources, complemented by frequent, open 
communication. If confirmed, I will treat all Embassy Montevideo team 
members with respect and will help reinforce respectful workplace 
culture.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No, I do not believe it is acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either publicly or privately.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. The relationship between the Chief of Mission and Deputy 
Chief of Mission is the most important in the Mission, one that sets 
the tenor for the work and ultimate success of the mission. If 
confirmed, I would work closely with my DCM to ensure that together we 
are articulating a clear vision and that we are effectively monitoring 
and addressing challenges that our team faces, either internally or 
externally.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I anticipate my DCM will function as the 
chief operating officer of the Mission, charged with leading the 
implementation of the vision that we have articulated in coordination 
with Washington through the ICS and beyond. One of the most important 
responsibilities of the DCM is the professional development and 
mentorship of Embassy personnel, and if confirmed I will reaffirm the 
importance of that work and actively engage in that process. If 
confirmed, I will ask my DCM to lead a robust development program to 
ensure our more junior team members have the tools and skills needed to 
succeed and I would work closely with my DCM to support professional 
development at all levels. If confirmed, I will also ask the DCM to 
join me in strongly supporting the efforts of the Community Liaison 
Office to maintain the well-being and morale of the embassy community, 
including family members.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Yes, I believe that it is imperative to provide all 
employees with accurate, constructive feedback in order to encourage 
improvement and achieve peak performance. I view performance feedback 
as a mechanism to enhance the functioning of the broader Mission, in 
addition to supporting the personal growth, professional development, 
and retention of our personnel. I also believe it is important to 
recognize and celebrate the positive performance of team members who 
succeed.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I would support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback at all levels, and would begin by 
modeling this behavior.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Uruguay.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. As a Public Diplomacy-coned Foreign Service Officer with 
experience in a range of public diplomacy positions around the world 
throughout my career, I understand firsthand that U.S. diplomats abroad 
are uniquely positioned to engage directly with representatives across 
government and civil society to track and understand trends and 
developments abroad. It is vital to engage directly with a range of 
populations and hear a diverse range of voices, which requires a 
dedicated commitment to engagement. If confirmed, I would seek to 
support a robust outreach and travel schedule for myself and encourage 
it from the full Embassy Montevideo team, while taking into account all 
relevant health and security considerations. I understand that Embassy 
Montevideo has been generally able to travel safely throughout Uruguay, 
and if confirmed I will make it a priority to find ways for our team to 
safely engage in outreach across the country and with a range of 
interlocutors to support our objectives.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the fundamental 
engagement and outreach aspect of our work, requiring us to adapt and 
modernize. In addition to traditional in-person meetings and travel, 
which have been ongoing in Uruguay since mid-2020, if confirmed, I will 
leverage the new telecommunications technologies developed and adopted 
during the pandemic to connect with new and wider audiences.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts.

   What is the public diplomacy environment like in the Uruguay?

    Answer. Exchange programs such as Fulbright build connections 
between our countries, especially future Uruguayan leaders who pursue 
postgraduate study in the United States. In addition, professional 
exchange programs play an important role in addressing issues related 
to Uruguay's economic development, including promoting the value of 
entrepreneurship among historically risk-averse Uruguayans.
    Uruguayans have an affinity for the United States and are receptive 
in general to U.S. points of view. In an October 2021 State Department-
led survey, Uruguayans expressed broadly positive views of the United 
States and admiration for its economic power and strong educational 
system. In explaining their positive views, Uruguayans pointed to the 
United States' status as a world power, the benefit to Uruguay from 
bilateral economic ties, family and friends living in the United 
States, past U.S. help to Uruguay, the new U.S. administration or U.S. 
democracy, and the high U.S. standard of living.
    Uruguay has one of the oldest Fulbright Commissions in the region, 
and the Uruguayan Government provides in-kind and monetary support 
annually to support Fulbright and other exchange opportunities. There 
are 39 American Spaces embedded in public spaces throughout the 
country, which are supported by the Uruguayan Government. Programming 
in these spaces reaches more than 15,000 individuals a year.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. While public opinion of the United States is positive in 
Uruguay, there is a strong tradition of anti-Americanism among some 
leftist political groups. These groups are often enthusiastic to serve 
as amplifiers of rival messaging, including that of non-democratic 
states such as Cuba, Venezuela, Russia, and the People's Republic of 
China (PRC).
    In addition, the PRC continues efforts to increase its soft power 
in Uruguay. The PRC Embassy in Uruguay is active, with significant 
social media outreach by the ambassador and a robust media campaign 
including paid advertising. As in other countries in the region, the 
PRC has concluded numerous sister cities agreements and opened a 
Confucius Institute.
    Although fully free to operate under Uruguayan law, Uruguay's civil 
society sector is less developed than other sectors of society. Civil 
society organizations are frequently small and are often volunteer-led. 
While this has created challenges for partnering with a diverse range 
of well-established NGOs, it has also provided an opportunity for 
partnership and capacity building in our public diplomacy efforts. 
Uruguay's status as a high-income country also means there are limited 
resources to provide direct assistance and support to Uruguay, a 
restriction that other countries do not face and have taken advantage 
of to bolster their soft power.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. As a Public Diplomacy-coned officer, I understand the 
importance of coordinating a unified message. It is vital that the in-
country mission tailors the goals and messaging from Washington in a 
way that reflects and references our many shared values with Uruguay. 
The Embassy Montevideo Public Affairs team uses their expertise in the 
media environment in Uruguay to convey U.S. policy objectives in a way 
that maximizes the messaging impact with the Uruguayan public, ensuring 
that our messaging is respectful of the historically strong bilateral 
relationship. On the other hand, based on the topic and target 
audience, some messages are more effective coming from Washington 
voices. If confirmed, I will work closely with colleagues in Washington 
to craft effective messages and serve as an effective messenger to 
further U.S. objectives.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes, I take nothing more seriously than the health and 
security of the people who work with me, and I commit to taking the 
threat of Anomalous Health Incidents (AHI) seriously. The interagency 
community continues its examination of a range of hypotheses. Secretary 
Blinken prioritizes the Department's response to AHI, setting clear 
goals for the Health Incident Response Task Force to strengthen the 
Department's communication with its workforce, and providing care for 
affected employees and family members.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Montevideo personnel?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I commit to talking as openly as 
possible to Embassy Montevideo personnel about AHI, among other issues.

                    follow-up question submitted to 
                    heide b. fulton by senator risch
          Question. In your view, what steps can the United States take 
        to deepen law enforcement cooperation with Uruguay?

          Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to applying the 
        expertise I have developed leading security cooperation in the 
        region as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere 
        Programs in the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law 
        Enforcement Affairs (INL). Uruguay has prioritized citizen 
        security and has taken steps to counter transnational criminal 
        organizations that are trying to make inroads across its 
        borders. If confirmed, preventing transnational organized crime 
        from using Uruguay as a bridge to transport drugs to Europe, 
        and the resulting violence in Uruguay, will be one of my 
        highest priorities. In response to Uruguay's recent requests 
        for capacity building, INL incorporated Uruguay in regional 
        programs that address our shared security priorities, such as 
        U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime's Container Control Program, 
        which established Uruguay's first inter-agency Port Control 
        Unit in Montevideo to address the increase in cocaine seizures 
        there in recent years. Additionally, we are including Uruguay 
        in regional anti-money laundering and cybercrime programs, to 
        strengthen Uruguay's capabilities to address these increasing 
        threats. At the same time, the Department of Defense has 
        increased military-military collaboration with Uruguay's armed 
        forces, including donations of badly needed patrol boats to the 
        Navy through the Excess Defense Articles program to support 
        increased patrols and interdiction efforts. With INL support, 
        DEA is cross-training Uruguayan officials with counterparts in 
        neighboring countries. DEA's Buenos Aires-based team spends a 
        good deal of time in Uruguay collaborating on counternarcotics 
        investigations. If confirmed, I will make the case for the DEA 
        to increase its resources dedicated to Uruguay.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
          Submitted to Heide B. Fulton by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. It should be clear to everyone in this administration 
that the Chinese Communist Party is the most comprehensive military, 
economic and political threat our nation faces today. Right now, in 
Latin America and the Caribbean, it is working to undermine our 
interests and our allies, whether that's by supplying the fentanyl 
smuggled across our open border or assisting dictators that continue to 
drive people to emigrate to the U.S.

   Is the Chinese Communist Party a threat to the United States?

    Answer. The President has made it clear the United States views the 
People's Republic of China (PRC) as a strategic competitor that 
challenges the existing rules-based international order. Certain PRC 
activities represent a challenge to U.S. interests in the region, 
particularly investments in critical infrastructure and sensitive 
sectors such as transportation facilities and telecommunication 
projects. As Secretary Blinken noted, we will invest, align, and 
compete with the PRC to defend our interests and build our vision for 
the future. If confirmed, I will invest in our partnership with 
Uruguay, highlight the risks associated with aspects of PRC engagement 
that could impact Uruguay's security and sovereignty and U.S. 
interests, and work to ensure that our vision of a positive bilateral 
partnership in support of regional security and prosperity competes 
successfully with the PRC.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to stop the expansion of 
the CCP's influence in Uruguay?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will lead the effort to advance our 
positive agenda for Uruguay, seeking out ways to remove impediments to 
cooperation and to find new tools for deepening our support. If 
confirmed, I will also work to ensure that we understand the People's 
Republic of China's (PRC) initiatives and can effectively respond to 
any threats to our interests. If confirmed, I will also raise concerns 
about the potential long-term negative impact of risky PRC critical 
infrastructure projects and investment.
    In contrast to PRC economic entities, which have a limited presence 
in Uruguay, U.S. companies represent some of the biggest sources of 
foreign direct investment in Uruguay and have been for decades. 
American farm machinery and biotechnology drive Uruguay's agricultural 
industry, and if confirmed, I will work to ensure U.S. companies are 
well placed to take advantage of traditional and emerging 
opportunities. If confirmed, I will also support high-quality 
investment in infrastructure that meets international standards.

    Question. Uruguay is a strong partner and supporter of democratic 
values and human rights in our hemisphere. Uruguay has also denounced 
the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a ``grave and unjustifiable 
violation of international law.'' It has also supported the OAS 
condemning the Maduro regime for its human rights violations. If 
confirmed, will you continue to advocate for strong relations between 
the United States and Uruguay in support of democracy and respect for 
the rule of law?

    Answer. I believe that Uruguay's strategic importance in the region 
is clear, and that supporting Uruguay is and should be a priority for 
the United States. If confirmed, I will work to deepen our 
relationship. The United States and Uruguay have a strong and long-
standing relationship with over more than 150 years of uninterrupted 
diplomatic ties. The strength of our historic relationship is based on 
shared commitments to democracy, human rights, economic prosperity, the 
rule of law, and security. Uruguay continues to serve as a global model 
of democracy and has spoken out against autocratic leaders that 
threaten freedom and democratic stability.
    We have an important opportunity now to further strengthen our 
extensive cooperation with Uruguay. I understand that we will launch 
the first U.S.-Uruguay Annual Bilateral Inter-Ministerial Dialogue 
later this year. Our governments will work together to identify time-
bound deliverables in areas of the bilateral relationship such as the 
economy, climate, science and technology, democracy and human rights, 
security, and education. If confirmed, I will use this new platform to 
support Uruguay as a vital partner of the United States.

    Question. In April, I wrote an op-ed making the case for why it is 
important to continue to have closer relations with Uruguay in areas 
such as trade, security, space, and counter-narcotics. I think it is 
very important that we strengthen our bilateral relations with a 
partner like Uruguay. If confirmed, what will be your main priorities 
as Ambassador to Uruguay?

    Answer. Trade, security and counter-narcotics, and space all 
represent areas of potential additional bilateral cooperation. If 
confirmed, I look forward to applying the expertise I have developed 
leading security cooperation in the region as the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Western Hemisphere Programs in the Bureau of 
International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). Uruguay has 
prioritized citizen security and has taken steps to combat 
transnational criminal organizations that are trying to make inroads 
across its borders. We are actively incorporating Uruguay into U.S.-
funded cross-training with neighboring countries in order to strengthen 
our collective efforts to counter criminal networks. In response to 
Uruguayan requests for capacity building, INL launched programs 
tailored to Uruguay, including the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime's 
Container Control Program, which enabled the establishment of Uruguay's 
first inter-agency task force at the Port of Montevideo to address the 
increase in cocaine seizures there in recent years. We are including 
Uruguay in regional anti-money laundering and cybercrime programs, the 
Department of Defense has increased its collaboration with their 
military counterparts, and DEA is cross-training Uruguayan officials 
with counterparts in neighboring countries. I understand that Uruguay 
is in the early stages of building a national space program and a 
satellite launch capability, and if confirmed, I will support 
Department of Defense and State Department efforts to promote 
international rules-based space cooperation and security.

    Question. It is my understanding that Trade and Investment 
Framework Agreement (TIFA) is under negotiation with Uruguay. What can 
you tell me about the status of that agreement?

    Answer. The United States has a robust and dynamic agenda in 
Uruguay, including continuing to expand our strong trade relationship. 
I understand the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and the Uruguayan 
Government are currently negotiating updates to modernize the Trade and 
Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA). The updates promote sustainable 
and inclusive trade policies that benefit the widest number of people, 
and we are eager to see the negotiations successfully conclude. The 
updates support competitiveness and economic recovery, specifically 
focusing on the areas of trade facilitation, good regulatory practices, 
anti-corruption, and digital trade. In his April 12 meeting with 
Uruguay's Foreign Minister Bustillo in Washington, Secretary Blinken 
called on the Government of Uruguay to use the final agreement on the 
protocols to celebrate the U.S.-Uruguay trade relationship.

    Question. What do you think that agreement should include 
addressing both America's and Uruguay's priorities for our bilateral 
trade?

    Answer. I understand that at the most recent TIFA meeting, topics 
for discussion included a decision to renegotiate the trade 
facilitation protocol, as well as tax discussions, statements on 
environmental issues such as illegal fishing and fishing subsidies, 
forced labor, services, customs cooperation, and intellectual property, 
especially geographical indications, and biotechnology. I believe that 
updating the TIFA to include additional topics could bring benefits to 
both the United States and Uruguay by increasing opportunities for U.S. 
investors and small businesses, potentially bolstering our already 
significant investment stock in Uruguay. If confirmed, I look forward 
to working with the USTR and the Department of Commerce to help 
successfully conclude the TIFA negotiations and further strengthen our 
trade ties with Uruguay.

    Question. Do you think this agreement will be sufficient to 
dissuade Uruguay from negotiating a free trade agreement with China?

    Answer. Uruguay will pursue relationships and partnerships in the 
best interests of Uruguay, just as the United States does. The 
administration of President Luis Lacalle Pou has sought to sign and 
expand free trade agreements with many countries across the world, 
including in Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. We want to be at the 
table as a partner and friend of Uruguay, expanding on our shared 
principles and values for the mutual benefit of both the United States 
and Uruguay. Uruguay's strong institutions help drive trade and 
investment, and we will encourage Uruguay to avoid taking any steps 
through trade negotiations that would weaken the institutional strength 
that has served it well. I believe that concluding TIFA negotiations 
would be a positive next step in our trade relationship, as they 
promote sustainable and inclusive trade policies that benefit a wide 
swath of people. The updates to the TIFA support competitiveness and 
economic recovery, specifically focusing on the areas of trade 
facilitation, good regulatory practices, anti-corruption, and digital 
trade.

    Question. What is your proposal to counter China's investments in 
Uruguay and make the United States the preferred partner of choice for 
Uruguay?

    Answer. In addition to conveying our concerns about the risks of 
problematic PRC investment in sensitive sectors, if confirmed, I would 
build on the existing advantages the United States has in the Uruguayan 
market. While the PRC is Uruguay's top trading partner and a major 
destination for goods exports, it is not a major investor in Uruguay. 
Uruguay is keenly interested in the U.S. market and attracting U.S. 
investment. The United States is Uruguay's third largest trading 
partner in goods, after China, Brazil, and level with Argentina. There 
is even more significant bilateral trade in services, particularly in 
the IT sector, where Uruguayan IT exports to the U.S. are estimated at 
over $1 billion. Accounting for trade in services would dramatically 
impact the calculus on economic contributions to the Uruguayan economy 
and could position the United States as Uruguay's largest trading 
partner or a close second. Supporting Uruguay's sustainable economic 
growth is strategic objective for the United States, and if confirmed, 
I will continue to make that a priority.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
        Submitted to Robert J. Faucher by Senator James E. Risch

Democracy and Human Rights
    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Human Rights report, 
Suriname was noted for cruel and degrading treatment of individuals by 
police, widespread acts of corruption, and the existence of some of the 
worst forms of child labor.

   What is your assessment of the effectiveness of these efforts by 
        the Government?

    Answer. The Republic of Suriname has taken steps to investigate, 
prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, 
whether in the security forces or elsewhere in the Government. For 
example, authorities prosecuted three police officers for suspected 
complicity in child sex trafficking. However, resource and capacity 
issues continue to pose challenges to the effectiveness of these 
efforts. The Government has investigated cases of corruption and 
implemented the laws on corruption unevenly. While the country lacks 
inspectors solely dedicated to child labor, the Government has trained 
all inspectors to identify child labor and instructed them how to 
handle suspected cases. Half of inspectors received training on child 
trafficking in previous reporting periods.

    Question. If confirmed, what actions would you take with host 
government to address the conditions in prison facilities?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would encourage the Government of Suriname 
to address the conditions in prison facilities, which fall well short 
of international standards. Resources permitting, I would work to 
assist their government in gaining training and professionalization 
assistance for its prison officials so that Suriname upgrades the 
conditions of its prison facilities.

    Question. How could you work with the Government to continue to 
build on and improve the country's human rights record?

    Answer. The Santokhi administration has made repeated public 
commitments to upholding human rights and has taken concrete steps to 
reduce its reporting backlog with the InterAmerican Court on Human 
Rights. The Government assigned a former Attorney General to update its 
required reporting (Suriname's last updates were made in 2017) and move 
investigations forward on some longstanding cases such as the Moiwana 
Massacre. If confirmed, I will work with the Government of Suriname to 
build on and improve Suriname's human rights record, particularly by 
focusing attention on decades-long human rights cases such as the 
December 8 murders and the killings in Tamanredjo. I will also maintain 
Embassy Paramaribo's close collaboration with human rights 
organizations and other civil society organizations concerned with 
Suriname's human rights record.

    Question. If confirmed, how can you direct your mission to better 
support civil society actors to improve the human rights situation on 
the ground?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would reinforce post's long-standing 
commitment to supporting civil society actors on human rights issues, 
as well as ensure that all embassy staff, regardless of position, 
consider human rights a mission priority. I would require all personnel 
to complete the State Department's atrocities prevention training and 
other human rights training, as appropriate. I would encourage U.S. and 
local staff to communicate their concerns about human rights issues 
occurring in Suriname, and I would ensure that our grant programming 
supports human rights defenders and other relevant civil society 
actors.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons 
report, Suriname remained a Tier 2 country for not fully meeting the 
minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, but is making 
significant efforts to do so. However, the Government did not convict 
any traffickers during the year of the report, did not provide adequate 
services for victims, and did not sufficiently fund anti-trafficking 
efforts.

   If confirmed, how could you work with the host government to 
        improve victims' services and overall anti-trafficking efforts?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will encourage the Government of Suriname 
to continue to make progress against human trafficking in the areas of 
prosecution, protection, and prevention by: increasing efforts to 
convict traffickers, following due process, and sentencing convicted 
traffickers to significant prison terms; increasing efforts to 
investigate and prosecute alleged traffickers, including officials 
complicit in trafficking crimes; providing vulnerable individuals with 
trauma-informed assistance, reintegration support, and interpretation 
in their language prior to, during, and after screening for 
trafficking; providing adequate and dedicated funding for the National 
Action Plan and government departments carrying out anti-trafficking 
activities; prosecuting child sex and labor trafficking cases under the 
trafficking statute and provide specialized child protection services 
with trained providers; fully implementing the victim identification 
and referral protocol and training officials in its use to identify 
trafficking victims, especially among at-risk groups; training judges 
at all levels of the judiciary in human trafficking and the trafficking 
law and sensitizing judges and prosecutors to the issue of secondary 
trauma; supporting NGOs and foreign embassies on victim identification 
and service provision; incorporating survivor input into anti-
trafficking policies, developing and executing a robust monitoring and 
evaluation framework, and publishing the results; and referring to care 
victims identified through the hotline and reporting on the hotline's 
effectiveness.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, Suriname's constitution provides for freedom of 
religion and the constitution and law prohibit discrimination based on 
religion. U.S. officials have continued to highlight U.S. Government 
policy on the importance of protecting religious freedom and tolerance.

   What is your assessment of these efforts?

    Answer. Suriname is proud of its rich multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, 
multi-religious heritage. In 2022, President Santokhi held events at 
the Presidential Palace marking days sacred to each of the major 
religions, including a first-ever Iftar dinner held at the Palace. The 
Government of Suriname remains strongly committed to ensuring religious 
freedom. If confirmed, I will ensure the U.S. mission in Paramaribo 
reinforces the importance of tolerance and religious freedom with the 
Government of Suriname, religious leaders, and appropriate civil 
society organizations.

    Question. If confirmed, how could you work with political and 
religious leaders to continue to build upon religious freedoms?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would utilize the U.S.-Suriname Bilateral 
Dialogue and personal engagement with government and religious leaders 
to continue to build upon religious freedoms. I would ensure that all 
stakeholders were aware of the importance that the United States places 
on religious freedom and our continued collaboration to build upon 
Suriname's firm foundation in this arena.

    Question. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the U.N., including in elections 
for specialized bodies like the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who if 
elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. 
She is in a tough race that will require early, consistent engagement 
across capitals and within the U.N. member states.

   If confirmed, do you commit to demarching the Suriname Government 
        and any other counterparts necessary to encourage their support 
        of Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed I commit to demarching the Suriname 
Government and any other counterparts necessary to encourage support of 
Ms. Bogdan-Martin. As Director of the Office of Specialized and 
Technical Agencies in the State Department's Bureau of International 
Organizations (2013-2015), I led efforts to support Doreen Bogdan-
Martin's leadership of the ITU's Strategic Planning and Membership 
Department. Ms. Bogdan-Martin is a global leader in the information and 
communication technologies sector and would be an outstanding 
Secretary-General of the International Telecommunications Union.

    Question. If confirmed, how can you work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify, recruit, 
and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior Program 
Officer (JPO) program at the U.N.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would coordinate with the IO bureau to 
assist it in casting as wide a net as possible to identify and recruit 
appropriate qualified American candidates for positions at the U.N. 
like the Junior Program Officer (JPO) program. I would also encourage 
the American staff at Embassy Paramaribo and qualified Americans in 
Suriname to consider such opportunities.

    Question. Suriname has a low rate of voting coincidence with the 
U.S. in the U.N. General Assembly and in the Security Council.

   What is your assessment of this issue?

    Answer. In 2020 Suriname voted with the United States 22 percent of 
the time. In 2021, the Suriname-U.S. voting coincidence improved on 
some key votes such as on Nicaragua-related matters. Suriname was an 
early, strong voice condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine. At the 
same time, Suriname tends to follow or coordinate its votes with 
Caribbean Community (CARICOM) member states in this regard and often 
abstains on critical votes. If confirmed, I will work assiduously to 
improve Suriname's voting coincidence with the United States in the 
U.N. General Assembly.

    Question. If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to 
engage with the Suriname Government on anticipated votes in the U.N. 
system that would increase their voting coincidence with the U.S.?

    Answer. Suriname is a CARICOM member and coordinates its votes with 
its fellow member states. Suriname currently holds the chair of 
CARICOM, and if confirmed, I would work closely with the Bureau of 
International Organizations, the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, 
and my fellow U.S. Ambassadors to CARICOM and CARICOM countries to 
provide persuasive arguments to move individual members, such as 
Suriname, to be reasoned, persuasive voices within the CARICOM internal 
discussions.
State Department Manangement and Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID.

   What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission Paramaribo?

    Answer. I understand that the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic has 
had a profound impact on Mission Paramaribo. Global U.S. staffing 
shortages have placed additional stress on this already small post. 
Nevertheless, the Mission staff, both direct hire and local staff, have 
lived up to the highest standards of the Department by continuing to 
perform at the very highest level, advocating for U.S. interests and 
bilateral cooperation related to political and economic issues, 
managing development programs, and providing routine and emergency 
American citizen services in both Suriname and French Guiana. I applaud 
what they have done and continue to do. If confirmed, it will be my 
honor to lead such an outstanding group of public servants.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission 
Paramaribo?

    Answer. The morale, well-being, and safety of all mission employees 
will be one of my top priorities as Ambassador, if confirmed. I will 
work with Embassy leadership to ensure there are proper resources in 
place for all employees to contribute to the Mission's success. I will 
also make every effort to ensure that all employees are aware that I 
care about them, that I want to hear from them, and that it is my duty 
to work with them to address their concerns.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Paramaribo?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will utilize the annual Suriname-U.S. 
Bilateral Dialogue, as well as the Embassy's Integrated Country 
Strategy and other guiding strategic documents to ensure that our staff 
know and understand our mission. I will utilize regular meetings of the 
Embassy's country team to empower the staff to carry out the vision of 
these foundational strategic documents.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I would describe my management style as empowering staff 
while holding them accountable for performance and results. I seek to 
foster open, frank communications among staff members, while providing 
strategic leadership regarding mission goals and objectives.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No, I do not believe it is ever acceptable or constructive 
to berate subordinates, either in public or private.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to working with the Deputy 
Chief of Mission and establishing a relationship that will prove to be 
mutually beneficial and provide the Embassy the leadership structure 
required for success. An effective Embassy requires a strong, 
complementary relationship between the Ambassador and the Deputy Chief 
of Mission. I recognize that it will be my responsibility to work with 
the DCM in a way that takes advantage of their talents and experience, 
while continuing to support their professional development so that they 
are prepared to assume roles of greater responsibility later in their 
career. I envision my relationship with the Deputy Chief of Mission as 
including strong elements of mentoring for continued professional 
development, delegation of responsibly for oversight of executive 
operations, and reliance as an ``alter ego.''

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I anticipate the Deputy Chief of Mission to 
play a key role on three Mission priorities: the effective 
implementation of the Integrated Country Strategy by the Country Team; 
advocating for U.S. interests and enhanced bilateral cooperation; and 
serving as my principal counsel on matters relating to our staff and 
their welfare. My DCM will also have responsibility for mentoring any 
first or second tour officers and specialists at Embassy Paramaribo.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Yes, I believe it is important to provide employees with 
accurate, constructive feedback on their performance in order to 
encourage improvement, professional development, and reward those who 
most succeeded in their roles. To that end, accurate and direct 
employee evaluation reports for Foreign Service Officers are 
imperative, and if confirmed, I will ensure the timely and accurate 
completion of all employee evaluation processes at Embassy Paramaribo.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I would support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Suriname.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. Yes, now that pandemic domestic restrictions have largely 
lifted, I understand that our diplomats in Suriname do engage outside 
the Embassy to great effect to accomplish their mission. Admittedly, 
critical U.S. personnel staffing gaps limit the capacity to do so, and 
the inaccessibility of some areas of the country except by small 
aircraft or boat also pose challenges.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the fundamental 
engagement and outreach aspect of our work, encouraging us to adapt and 
modernize. In addition to traditional in-person meetings and travel, 
which have been ongoing in Suriname since mid-2020, if confirmed, I 
will leverage the new telecommunications technologies developed and 
adopted during the pandemic to connect with new and wider audiences.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in the 
Suriname?

    Answer. Facebook remains the largest platform for social media in 
Suriname and therefore remains a high priority area for public 
diplomacy efforts while also engaging with the much smaller audiences 
on other services as warranted. Surinamers are largely receptive to the 
United States and our messaging. Pre-pandemic, Embassy Paramaribo's 
film festivals and events were well attended and well received. I 
understand that the Embassy continued its work in those arenas in 
alternate manners during the pandemic and has plans in place to return 
to these popular programs in-person this fall as the country returns to 
pre-COVID-19 levels of activity.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. Language difficulties, particularly outside of Paramaribo, 
pose a challenge as knowledge of Dutch and English is not universal. 
Several other local and regional languages proliferate in the interior 
and require interpretation for public diplomacy efforts.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. When it comes to tailoring public diplomacy messages in 
Suriname, the key is to find the intersections between the global 
messaging and the importance of that issue for the Surinamese public 
and then express that importance in a manner that emphasizes the 
relevance clearly and directly.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I commit to take seriously the threat of 
``anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as ``Havana 
Syndrome.'' In preparation for assuming the position of Chief of 
Mission Suriname, I have received several briefings concerning this 
threat and the importance of providing care for, protecting, and 
communicating with personnel under my authority about ``anomalous 
health incidents.''

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Paramaribo personnel?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I commit to talking as openly as 
practicable to Mission Paramaribo personnel and their families 
concerning the threat of ``anomalous health incidents'' and all other 
matters.

Room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. James Cardin 
presiding.
    Present: Senators Cardin [presiding], Coons, Kaine, and 
Hagerty.
    Also present: Senator Cornyn

         OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN,
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MARYLAND

    Senator Cardin. This Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
will come to order. I want to thank the leadership of our 
committee for entrusting to Senator Hagerty and myself the 
honor of chairing and ranking on this particular nomination 
hearing. I want to thank all of our nominees.
    We are going to defer to Senator Cornyn who wants to do an 
introduction.
    Senator Cornyn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is great to be 
with you and colleagues here for a very important introduction 
of Carrin Patman, nominated to serve as the Ambassador to the 
Republic of Iceland.
    I have known Carrin longer than either one of us would care 
to admit. Our paths first crossed in Bear County, Texas, my 
hometown, San Antonio, when I was a baby district judge, pretty 
new to the bench, and Carrin was a young lawyer. She had just 
finished law school at the University of Texas and was at the 
starting line of what would be a long and distinguished career 
as a litigator, a trial lawyer. Carrin spent three decades 
practicing with international law firm Bracewell and became the 
first women elected to the firm's seven-member management 
committee.
    After retiring from Bracewell in 2016, Carrin was appointed 
to serve as the chair of the Board of the Metropolitan Transit 
Authority of Houston, or Harris County, as we know it, called 
METRO. Houston is the fourth-largest city in the country, and 
Harris County is the third-largest county. METRO has a $1.3 
billion budget, 4,100 employees, and it covers 1,300 square 
miles. That is a long way of saying that chairing METRO is no 
easy task. It requires diplomatic skills and an ability to 
bring competing constituencies together.
    Fortunately, Carrin has mastered those skills. She turned 
them into an artform as the chair of Metro, and should the 
Senate confirm her for this position I know she will use those 
skills well and those experiences well to serve our country and 
fight for our interests abroad.
    In just a moment you will hear directly from Carrin about 
her career, civic involvement, and her deep love for America. 
You will see the passion, the skill, and the sound judgment 
that has guided her throughout her career. And I hope you will 
reach the same conclusion that I have, that Carrin Patman will 
be an outstanding ambassador.
    Four nearly four decades I have had the--I guess I 
disclosed it--for nearly four decades I have had the pleasure 
of knowing Carrin, as well as her husband Jim, who is here with 
us today, and I have full confidence in her ability to serve 
the American people as the ambassador to Iceland.
    So thank you again, Chairman Cardin and Ranking Member 
Hagerty, for giving me the opportunity to make this 
introduction today, and thank you to all of my colleagues, 
Senator Kaine, I saw Senator Coons earlier, for considering 
this nominee. I look forward to supporting this nomination and 
I hope you will too. Thanks so much.
    Senator Cardin. Senator Cornyn, we appreciate you taking 
the time to make these introductions. I know Senator Coons had 
the pleasure of being with the nominee on a plane flight to 
Washington, I was told. I do not know if that strategic 
planning that you decided to check his flight schedule to do 
that, but it was pretty good strategy.
    Senator Cornyn. I told you she was good.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Cardin. Thank you, Senator.
    Today, as I said, we are going to have hearings on nominees 
for some critically important ambassadors, ambassadors to the 
Netherland, Iceland, Slovak Republic, North Macedonia, and 
Namibia. Each one of these positions are critically important 
to our national security. These are extremely challenging times 
to be in global diplomacy and to represent the United States, 
and we appreciate each of you making that decision to help our 
country and to serve our nation. So first and foremost, I want 
to thank you for your willingness to step forward in these 
critically important roles.
    And secondly, I want to acknowledge your families. I see 
many sitting behind you today. You cannot do this without a 
supportive family, and there are certainly a lot of sacrifices 
that they make. So we thank them as well for sharing you with 
our country and the important work that you are going to be 
doing.
    Let me just talk very briefly about each of you and then I 
will let Senator Hagerty make his opening statements, and then 
we will hear directly from you.
    Shefali Razdan Duggal is a political activist, a women's 
rights advocate, and a human rights campaigner. In 2014, 
President Obama appointed her to the United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum Council, which I am also a member of that 
council, so thank you very much.
    Carrin Patman, as we heard from Senator Cornyn, is the 
chair of the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, 
Texas. She currently works as a partner at Bracewell LLP and 
worked as a trial lawyer, handling litigation for commercial 
disputes, antitrust, competition issues, and regulatory 
compliance. Earlier commitments to public service include her 
role as a founding board member of the Center for Women in Law 
and as executive committee member of Girls Inc. of Greater 
Houston, and Sheltering Arms Senior Services.
    Gautam Rana currently serves as the Deputy Chief of Mission 
at the U.S. Embassy in Algeria and was the embassy's Charge 
d'Affaires from August 2020 to February 2022. Mr. Rana was 
previously the Deputy Chief of Mission and also Charge 
d'Affaires ad interim at the U.S. Embassy in Slovenia. Among 
other positions, he was Director of Afghanistan and Pakistan on 
the National Security Council staff and the Deputy Minister 
Council for Political Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi.
    Ms. Angela Price Aggeler is a career member of the Senior 
Foreign Service with the rank of Minister-Council. She served 
as the Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in 
Islamabad, Pakistan, as well as its Charge d'Affaires. She 
formerly served as Minister-Council for Public Affairs at the 
U.S. Embassy in Paris, Acting Principal Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian 
Affairs, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Press and 
Public Diplomacy in the Bureau of Press and Public Diplomacy.
    She has held other diplomatic posts in Pakistan, North 
Macedonia, Vietnam, France, and India.
    And then Randy Berry, to be Ambassador of Namibia. Mr. 
Berry served as U.S. Ambassador to Nepal. Prior of that he was 
Deputy Assistant Secretary in the State Department of 
Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and before that the State 
Department's first Special Envoy for Human Rights of the LGBTI 
Persons.
    I understand that Senator Kaine will make an introduction 
for Ms. Duggal, but first let me turn it over to the ranking 
member, and then we will go Senator Kaine.
    Senator Haggerty.

                STATEMENT OF HON. BILL HAGERTY, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE

    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Chairman Cardin, and I want to 
thank all the nominees for appearing here today. I also 
appreciate your willingness to serve this great nation. I 
cannot tell you what an honor it is to represent the most 
exceptional nation in the world to any country, and you have 
been nominated to do just that. So just being here is quite an 
accomplishment, to have gotten to this point, and I hope that 
we have a good hearing today to move you along the path.
    I would like to start with the nominee to be the U.S. 
Ambassador to the Netherlands. The United States and the 
Netherlands share a long history of friendship and coordination 
that goes back to the American Revolution. I look forward to 
hearing from the nominee about how we can maintain a strong 
partnership and work to counter China's malign influence in 
Europe.
    With respect to the nominee to be Ambassador to Iceland, 
Iceland is a strategically important country, and both 
President Trump and President Biden have pushed hard for 
enhanced engagement on Arctic issues in light of concerns about 
Russian and Chinese activities in the region. I look forward to 
hearing from the nominee on this subject.
    Next I would like to turn to the nomination to be the 
Ambassador to the Slovak Republic. The U.S. and Slovakia share 
a commitment to freedom and human rights, and I believe 
Slovakia's experience can be a model for other emerging 
democracies. I hope our next Ambassador can continue to build 
our strong diplomatic ties and aid in fulfilling our 
commitments to this ally.
    For the nominee to be Ambassador to North Macedonia, the 
U.S. and North Macedonia have good relations, and recently held 
a Strategic Dialogue to take stock of the bilateral 
relationship and outline areas for enhanced cooperation. I am 
interested to know your thoughts on further areas of 
cooperation between the U.S. and this Western Balkan country.
    Last but certainly not least, I would like to focus on the 
nomination to be Ambassador to Namibia. The United States and 
Namibia share a friendly relationship, and I look forward to 
hearing from the nominee about how we can strengthen the U.S. 
partnership with Namibia in light of their close ties with 
China.
    And to all five nominees, again, thank you for serving our 
nation and for answering the questions of the committee today. 
I look forward to hearing your testimony.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.
    Senator Cardin. Thank you, Senator Hagerty.
    Senator Kaine for an introduction.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and to Senator 
Hagerty. It is real treat to be with a panel and Carrin, it is 
so good to see you as well. I do want to say just a few words 
of introduction about my longtime friend, Shefali Duggal, and I 
am really, really excited that she has been nominated for the 
Ambassador position in the Netherlands.
    Being in politics is tough. The travel is hard and 
sometimes you wonder whether the T-account, does the plus and 
minus come out on the right side. But one of the things that I 
have certainly enjoyed from 28 years at the local, state, and 
now Federal level is I have just met wonderful people that I 
might not have met otherwise, and I put Shefali and her family 
in that category.
    In the early 2010s I met Shefali on the West Coast, and 
came to know her. She is an immigrant to the United States from 
Kashmir, India. She is an experienced political activist, 
women's rights advocate, human rights campaigner, with a 
wonderful family. She is a former presidential appointee to the 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Council, where she 
acquitted herself in a very, very honorable way. She continues 
to serve as a Western Regional Advisor for that important 
American institution.
    On the West Coast she is a San Francisco Committee member 
on Human Rights Watch, passionate about human rights issues, a 
member of the Wake Forest University Leadership and Character 
Council, and she is has also served on the National Board of 
Directors for Emily's List. Shefali has received numerous 
awards from the Holocaust Museum, a Community Hero from the 
California State Assembly, one of the Most Powerful Women in 
California by the National Diversity Council.
    Shefali is just the kind of a person who is able to be 
passionate in her pride for this country. She will be a great 
Ambassador. She is also a great diplomat. She believes there is 
no challenge in life that a few Ghirardelli chocolate squares 
will not make go much better.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Kaine. And I think there is some wisdom there that 
we could all learn from.
    But I am going to stay and ask questions as a member of the 
committee, but I just wanted to introduce Shefali to my friends 
on this side of the dais and recommend her highly.
    Senator Cardin. Senator Kaine, thank you for this very fine 
introduction. We now know her a lot better.
    We are going to now hear from all of our witnesses. We 
would ask that you try to summarize your statements in about 5 
minutes. Your entire statement will be made part of the record.
    So we will start with Mrs. Duggal.

STATEMENT OF SHEFALI RAZDAN DUGGAL OF CALIFORNIA, NOMINATED TO 
 BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED 
      STATES OF AMERICA TO THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS

    Ms. Duggal. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Kaine. That was 
so lovely. I appreciate it.
    Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Hagerty, and distinguished 
committee members, it is a genuine honor to be with you today. 
Senator Kaine, thank you so very much for the incredibly kind 
introduction.
    I am deeply appreciative to President Biden and Secretary 
Blinken for the nomination and confidence in my ability to 
serve as Ambassador to the Kingdom of the Netherlands. If 
confirmed, I look forward to enthusiastically representing and 
serving the American people as a force multiplier for good to 
advance key U.S. foreign policy priorities.
    If I may, I would also like to also thank my husband of 24 
years, Rajat; my precious children, Tarak and Arya; my lifelong 
friends who have always been a protective shield of love and 
support; and the most resilient human I know, my mother, Veena 
Razdan. I would also like to thank the talented team at U.S. 
Embassy The Hague and Consulate General Amsterdam, who perform 
vital diplomatic work every day. If confirmed, I look forward 
to working with all of you closely.
    As an immigrant, I represent the diverse face of the United 
States and the generations of people throughout our history who 
found opportunity in our great country. I was raised by a 
single mom in Cincinnati, who worked two minimum-wage jobs to 
support us. My father left us when I was very young, and this 
profoundly and permanently affected the direction of my life. 
Rather than dwell upon what I did not have, I embraced the 
boundless opportunities that we are given here in the United 
States. I attended college and graduate school with the help of 
loans, grants, and scholarships.
    As I faced some of my own challenges of being a minority 
woman with limited resources, I became attuned to the values of 
diversity and inclusion that continue to inspire me today. I 
also focused on the rights of minorities and the critical 
importance of being a voice of the oppressed. This motivated me 
to pursue my years of work with Human Rights Watch and to serve 
as a member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council.
    While my life was often not easy, I was always saved by the 
Grace of God and the promise of the United States. I have full 
confidence that kindness, empathy, honesty, and sweat equity 
mean something in our country. It is the reason why people from 
all over the world see us as a beacon of hope and freedom. 
While my story is not unique, it is one that represents the 
infinite possibilities of the American Spirit and the American 
Dream.
    The Netherlands was the second country to formally 
recognize the new American republic, making the U.S.-Dutch 
connection one of our longest, unbroken, peaceful friendships. 
If confirmed, I will work, along with the talented mission 
team, to deepen our bilateral relationship, and advance the 
following three priorities.
    First, deepen bilateral and global security. If confirmed, 
my highest priority will always be the safety and security of 
the over 47,000 Americans in the Netherlands, including the 
300-plus mission personnel and their families, along with the 
1.5 million Americans who annually visit the Netherlands. The 
Netherlands has been a strong military ally of the United 
States. I will build on decades of close bilateral and 
multilateral relationships to face the global security 
challenges of today and potentially those of the future.
    Second, deepen our economic ties. The U.S.-Netherlands 
economic relationship is one of our deepest and most important 
trade relationships. The Netherlands is one of the largest 
foreign investors in the United States, and Dutch investment 
supports over 800,000 American jobs. If confirmed, I will work 
to deepen our economic ties, promote American business, 
encourage further Dutch investment in the United States, and 
promote our shared prosperity.
    Third, promote and defend our shared values of democracy 
and human rights. Throughout our 240-year friendship, our 
shared commitment to a rules-based international order forms 
our enduring foundation, especially in promoting and defending 
human rights, protecting democratic institutions, and 
strengthening the rule of law. If confirmed, I look forward to 
working with the Netherlands to meet ever-evolving new 
challenges.
    If confirmed, I will come to this position with humility 
and commitment. I would serve as the first person of color as 
the United States Ambassador to the Kingdom of the Netherlands. 
I am a grateful and loyal American who loves this country 
deeply. I was born in India, but I was made in the United 
States.
    It would be an honor to follow in the footsteps of our 
first ambassadorial envoy, John Adams. I wholeheartedly commit 
to being available to members of this committee, members of 
Congress, and staff, to work in partnership.
    Thank you so very much for your time. I look forward to 
answering your questions.

    Senator Cardin. Thank you very much for your comments.
    We will now go to Ms. Patman.

    STATEMENT OF CARRIN F. PATMAN OF TEXAS, NOMINATED TO BE 
  AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED 
          STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF ICELAND

    Ms. Patman. Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Hagerty, and 
distinguished committee members, it is the deepest honor to 
appear before you today as the President's nominee for the 
United States Ambassador to Iceland. I am honored and 
profoundly grateful to President Biden and Secretary Blinken 
for their confidence, and of course I am also deeply 
appreciative for the support of my home state Senators, Senator 
Cornyn, for his so very gracious introduction, and Senator Cruz 
as well.
    I am joined today by my husband, Jim Derrick, without whose 
love and support I would not be before you.
    This nomination is particularly special to me because I 
grew up in a family of public servants. My dad, Bill Patman, 
and my grandfather, Wright Patman, served in the United States 
House for a total of 51 years, so I completely understand that 
this role will require me to work in partnership with Congress 
on the issues that I will face. In fact, both my dad and 
granddad were in the audience when President Roosevelt 
delivered his Day of Infamy speech, my grandfather as a 
Congressman and my dad as a page.
    My maternal grandfather, Fred Mauritz, whose parents 
immigrated from Iceland's fellow Arctic country, Sweden, was a 
Texas state senator also, and in honor of our Scandinavian 
heritage my mother's Scandinavian heritage was so important to 
her that she raised the money to establish the Swedish 
Excellence Endowment at the University of Texas to be 
established, for which she was awarded the Royal Order of the 
Polar Star by the King of Sweden. So being nominated for this 
public service role, and in a country representing my own 
Nordic heritage, is deeply special.
    As Senators Cardin and Hagerty have noted, it is a critical 
time to serve in this role, and in Iceland. Iceland has long 
been our highly valued ally, a strong democracy whose bedrock 
values mirror our own, a founding member of NATO, a 70-year 
security partner, a fellow Arctic nation, and a country of 
enormous strategic importance as we all face threats from other 
powers.
    I have been blessed with opportunities that have prepared 
me to be a Chief of Mission and to build consensus among 
diverse stakeholders. And I will not repeat those from my 
statement here because Senator Cornyn kindly set those forth in 
his introduction.
    But if confirmed, the following are top priorities I would 
seek to advance. First, of course, to protect the safety and 
security of U.S. citizens in Iceland, including those under 
Chief of Mission authority, Embassy personnel and their 
families, and U.S. tourists. More tourists visit Iceland from 
the United States than from any other country, and I look 
forward to welcoming all of you on codels, I hope.
    Second, to advance our shared security interests. Iceland's 
key location, between North America and Europe, and at the 
center of two critical maritime passageways is even more 
important as melting Arctic ice increases maritime traffic. 
Russia and the People's Republic of China fully understand the 
economic and military importance of Iceland, and if confirmed, 
I will seek to deepen our security cooperation and support 
Iceland in managing these challenges. Ranking Member Hagerty 
had specifically discussed China, and yes, they, in fact, are 
increasing their presence in the Arctic, and I look forward to 
further discussing it in Iceland as well, if you want to 
question me about it.
    Third, if confirmed, I would seek to strengthen our 
economic relationship. The United States is already Iceland's 
most important single-country trading partner, with great 
opportunities for additional trade and investment. I would work 
with Iceland with respect to its vital role in sustaining our 
planet and as a world leader in renewable energy and a pioneer 
in carbon storage.
    Fifth, we are both members of the Arctic Council, so I 
would look forward to working with Iceland on Arctic issues.
    Additionally, of course, I would prioritize people-to-
people ties through exchange programs, robust public diplomacy 
efforts, and one-on-one contact with me and my husband, Jim. I 
am blessed that it is a country relatively small in population, 
so I hope to get to meet a lot of people in Iceland.
    It would be a privilege and honor of a lifetime to serve as 
the U.S. Ambassador to Iceland. Thank you for your time and 
consideration, and I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Patman follows:]


                 Prepared Statement of Carrin F. Patman

    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and distinguished members of the 
committee, thank you for the privilege of appearing before you today as 
the President's nominee for the United States Ambassador to Iceland. I 
am honored and deeply grateful to President Biden and Secretary Blinken 
for their confidence in me.
    I'm also deeply appreciative for the support of my home state 
Senators, Senator Cornyn and Senator Cruz.
    And I'm joined today by my husband, Jim Derrick, without whose love 
and support I would not be before you.
    This nomination is particularly meaningful to me because I grew up 
in a family of public servants. My dad, Bill Patman, and my paternal 
grandfather, Wright Patman, both served in the United States House of 
Representatives. My maternal grandfather, Fred Mauritz, whose parents 
immigrated from Iceland's fellow Arctic country, Sweden, was a Texas 
State Senator. My mother's Scandinavian heritage was so important to 
her that she raised the money to establish the Swedish Excellence 
Endowment at the University of Texas and was awarded the Royal Order of 
the Polar Star by the King of Sweden. So being nominated for this 
public service role, and to a country representing my own Nordic 
heritage, is deeply special.
    Moreover, it is a critical time in which to serve in this role, and 
in Iceland. Iceland has long been an important and highly valued ally. 
It is a strong democracy whose bedrock values mirror our own, a 
founding member of NATO, and a security partner with the United States 
for over 70 years. Iceland is a fellow Arctic nation with whom we have 
long cooperated on Arctic issues, and a country of great geostrategic 
importance to us and the world, as we collectively face concerning 
threats from other powers.
    I have been blessed with opportunities that have prepared me to be 
a chief of mission, and to build consensus among diverse stakeholders. 
Most recently, I led the Houston region's $1 billion transit agency 
serving almost 4 million people, bringing together the public and 
private sectors to develop and then secure overwhelming voter approval 
of a multi-billion-dollar plan to expand service, including to 
traditionally underserved constituencies. During several decades as a 
trial lawyer, I mastered complex and challenging cases, persuaded 
decision makers and often resolved disputes out-of-court even among 
antagonistic parties--one of my first cases was in then Judge Cornyn's 
court!--and was elected to multiple terms on our international law 
firm's management committee. And of course, I've had a lifelong 
involvement in public service through my family's service as well as my 
own.
    I'm thrilled to be nominated to serve in Iceland. The United States 
and Iceland cooperate on many important issues, from transatlantic 
security, to protecting fundamental human rights, tocombating climate 
change, to sustainably developing the Arctic. If confirmed, the 
following are top priorities I would seek to advance:
    First, to protect the safety and security of U.S. citizens in 
Iceland, including those under Chief of Mission authority, Embassy 
personnel and their families, and U.S. tourists. More tourists visit 
Iceland from the United States than from any other country.
    Second, to advance our shared security interests. Iceland's key 
location right between North America and Europe, and at the center of 
the critical maritime Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom Gap, is now even 
more important as melting ice increases maritime traffic in the Arctic. 
Russia and the People's Republic of China understand the strategic 
importance of Iceland, both economically and militarily, and if 
confirmed, I will seek to deepen our security cooperation with Iceland 
and support Iceland in managing these challenges.
    Third, if confirmed, I would seek to strengthen our economic 
relationship. The United States is Iceland's most important single-
country trading partner, with great opportunities for additional trade 
and investment.
    Fourth, Iceland plays a vital role in sustaining our planet, not 
only as an important site for research and understanding of climate 
developments, but also as a world leader in renewable hydropower and 
geothermal energy, and a pioneer in carbon storage.
    Fifth, as a fellow member of the Arctic Council, Iceland is an 
instrumental partner in shaping Arctic policy, and if confirmed I will 
work closely with Iceland on Arctic issues.
    Additionally, if confirmed, I will promote and strengthen people-
to-people ties with Iceland through exchange programs and robust public 
diplomacy efforts.
    I also look forward to working with Congress to further U.S. 
priorities in Iceland.
    It would be a privilege and honor of a lifetime to serve as the 
U.S. Ambassador to Iceland. Thank you for your time and consideration. 
I look forward to your questions.


    Senator Cardin. Thank you very much for your comments.
    We will now hear from Ms. Aggeler.

STATEMENT OF ANGELA PRICE AGGELER OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, 
    A CAREER MEMBER OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF 
 MINISTER-COUNSELOR, NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY 
  AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE 
                  REPUBLIC OF NORTH MACEDONIA

    Ms. Aggeler. Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Hagerty, and 
distinguished members of the committee, it is the honor of my 
Foreign Service career to appear before you today as President 
Biden's nominee to be the next U.S. Ambassador to the Republic 
of North Macedonia. I am humbled by and grateful for the trust 
President Biden and Secretary Blinken have placed in me to 
represent the United States in Skopje. I hope to also earn your 
trust, and if confirmed, would work closely with you to advance 
U.S. foreign policy priorities in North Macedonia.
    I would like to use this opportunity to recognize my 
husband, Brian, also a career member of the Senior Foreign 
Service and the Deputy Chief of Mission at our embassy in 
Paris. I would not be here today were it not for his continuous 
support. I would also like to thank my daughter, Madeleine, who 
has come from Austin, Texas, to have my back today, as always.
    I began my foreign service career in 1998, and have served 
in Pakistan, Vietnam, France, and India. I am also no stranger 
to North Macedonia. I served as Counselor for Public Affairs in 
Skopje, where I focused on educating and empowering youth and 
minority communities, good governance, and building a stronger 
economy and more tolerant society. I would be deeply honored to 
return to Skopje to serve as the U.S. Ambassador and to advance 
our priorities with this important strategic partner.
    NATO's newest ally, North Macedonia, will also assume the 
chairmanship of the OSCE in 2023. We must continue to work 
closely with North Macedonia in responding to the threats posed 
to our security and the international order, most immediately 
Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The urgency of this 
moment underscores the importance of deeper political, 
economic, cultural, security cooperation, and people-to-people 
ties with North Macedonia and other Western Balkan countries as 
they work to realize their strategic goals of European 
integration.
    The United States has supported North Macedonia's 
longstanding goal of EU accession. We stand firmly behind the 
EU enlargement process because it has advanced democratic 
development and promoted peace, stability, and prosperity on 
the European continent, building stronger strategic partners 
for the United States. North Macedonia has overcome difficult 
challenges and made tough choices to take historic steps 
forward on its accession path. If confirmed, I will build on 
these successes to secure that path forward.
    The United States and North Macedonia have many shared 
priorities, including fighting corruption, improving the rule 
of law, and strengthening good governance. If confirmed, I will 
encourage judicial reforms and urge the institutions of North 
Macedonia to promote transparency, investigate allegations of 
abuse, and decisively counter corruption to bolster public 
confidence in governance. I will work with interagency partners 
to help North Macedonia develop a national strategy that 
effectively holds corrupt actors accountable.
    If confirmed, I will work to support North Macedonia's 
economic future through policies to bolster its investment 
climate, strengthen infrastructure, improve energy diversity 
and security, and build resistance to malign external 
influence, including from Russia and China. I will work to 
advance the country's integration into regional economic growth 
initiatives based on EU standards, such as Open Balkan and 
Common Regional Market. I will support American companies 
exploring opportunities in North Macedonia.
    North Macedonia needs to diversify energy sources and 
routes and develop competitive, transparent, and efficient 
energy markets. If confirmed, I will champion the country's 
transition from coal towards cleaner alternatives and create 
the market conditions that attract American investment that 
will spur North Macedonia to become a regional energy hub.
    Finally, if confirmed, I will build on the positive 
momentum of June's bilateral Strategic Dialogue, which you 
mentioned, Senator Hagerty, which touched on a range of issues, 
including deepening military-to-military cooperation.
    It would be an honor to lead our Embassy Skopje team and 
work with the Government, citizens, and our international 
partners on these priorities. Thank you again for the 
opportunity to appear before you, and I welcome your questions.

               Prepared Statement of Angela Price Aggeler

 STATEMENT OF GAUTAM A. RANA OF NEW JERSEY, A CAREER MEMBER OF 
THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF COUNSELOR, NOMINATED TO BE 
  AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED 
            STATES OF AMERICA TO THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC

    Mr. Rana. Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Hagerty, Senator 
Kaine, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you 
today. I am honored to be President Biden's nominee for the 
position of Ambassador to the Slovak Republic. I am grateful 
for the trust and confidence the President and Secretary 
Blinken have placed in me. If confirmed, I pledge to work with 
you to advance our nation's interests in the Slovak Republic.
    I first want to thank my wife, Alexsa Alonzo, and my sons 
Rohan and Arjun. Alexsa and Rohan are here with me today, and 
my younger son, Arjun, is watching from home with my wonderful 
sister-in-law, Alicia Alonzo. I am so proud of them all, and I 
am here before you today because of their love, sacrifice, and 
support. As part of a diplomatic family that moves every few 
years, I want to thank them for their own service to our 
country.
    My family and I are the embodiment of the American Dream, 
thanks to the courage, vision, and sacrifice of my parents, 
Amrat and Nirmala Rana. When I was only a year old, my father 
departed his native India and arrived at JFK Airport with $20 
dollars in his pocket. For 3 years, he worked a succession of 
minimum-wage jobs before his wife and three children joined him 
in New Jersey. My mother and father made tremendous sacrifices 
for me, my sisters, and their extended family, believing in 
their hearts that America truly was the land of opportunity and 
that their hard work would be rewarded. They stressed to my 
sisters and me the importance of education and how it could 
liberate us to pursue our dreams. Thanks to my parents' 
sacrifices and hard work, and my own journey as an immigrant, I 
am deeply conscious of how privileged I am to be an American 
citizen, and I am honored to have served and represented my 
country as a diplomat for the last 20 years.
    As a person with a disability, I am also immensely grateful 
for the opportunities and freedom I have had as an American. I 
contracted polio as a child in India and need to use a leg 
brace and forearm crutches to walk. Between my time in the 
Peace Corps and Foreign Service, I have lived and worked in 
eight foreign countries on four continents. Though we still 
have much to do in the United States to ensure all disabled 
people can live full and dignified lives, I believe from my own 
lived experience that we are doing much better than many other 
countries. I sit before you today as an ambassador-nominee only 
because my parents had the wisdom and foresight to come to the 
United States.
    As a Foreign Service Officer, I have advanced U.S. 
interests all over the globe, including in Europe. Next year 
marks the 30th anniversary of Slovakia's independence, and if 
confirmed, I hope to continue strengthening our already close 
relationship with the Slovak Republic.
    If confirmed, I will have no greater priority than the 
protection of my Embassy team and our citizens, from ensuring 
the safety of individual American travelers to bolstering 
homeland security through bilateral law enforcement 
cooperation.
    If confirmed, I will focus the Embassy on three priorities. 
First, supporting Slovakia's capacity to become a more active 
and capable partner in strengthening regional and global 
security and stability. I will also prioritize supporting 
Slovakia as it stands with Ukraine against Russia's aggression. 
Slovakia has already provided more that 159 million euros in 
humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine, including donating an 
S-300 air defense system at a crucial time. Slovakia remains 
one of the largest donors to Ukraine measured by aid as a share 
of GDP, and since 2014, Slovakia has provided a critical link 
for Ukraine to import natural gas from Europe.
    Second, if confirmed, I will also focus on strengthening 
bilateral trade and investment, including by increasing 
opportunities for U.S. companies in the Slovak market and for 
Slovak companies that want to invest in the United States. I 
will promote U.S. exports, fight for transparency and the rule 
of law as Slovakia improves its business environment, and press 
for greater energy diversity and efficiency that will enhance 
Slovak and European energy security while advancing their 
climate change goals.
    Third, if confirmed, as you noted, Senator Hagerty, I will 
also focus on reinforcing Slovakia's commitment to the West and 
on actively engaging the Slovak public to build support for our 
shared commitment to democracy and human rights. This includes 
working with our Slovak partners in addressing disinformation.
    As demonstrated by the First Lady's visit to Slovakia in 
May, the United States continues to deepen our partnership with 
the Slovak Republic. If confirmed, it would be the honor of my 
life to lead our outstanding team in Bratislava to advance our 
country's interests there and across the region.
    Mr. Chair, Ranking Member, Senator Kaine, thank you again 
for the opportunity to appear before you today. I welcome your 
questions.

    Senator Cardin. Thank you for your testimony.
    We will now hear from Ambassador Berry.

 STATEMENT OF HON. RANDY W. BERRY OF COLORADO, A CAREER MEMBER 
   OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF CAREER MINISTER, 
NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF 
    THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF NAMIBIA

    Ambassador Berry. Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Hagerty, 
and members of the committee, I am deeply honored to appear 
before you this afternoon as President Biden's nominee to be 
the next U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Namibia. I thank 
President Biden and Secretary Blinken for their confidence and 
trust in this nomination, and if confirmed, look forward to 
continuing my nearly 30 years of service to the United States 
Government, this time to advance our relationship with the 
Namibian Government and the Namibian people.
    I am a proud sixth-generation son of the soil of the great 
state of Colorado. My Foreign Service career has taken me from 
a childhood on horseback on my family-run cattle ranch in the 
shadow of the Rockies to my current office in Kathmandu, in the 
shadow of the Himalayas, where I am now concluding 4-year 
tenure as Ambassador soon. I have had the great opportunity, 
however, to live and work on the African continent for nearly a 
decade over my career, advancing U.S. interests and 
relationships there.
    As you are aware, and mentioned, Senator Cardin, the 
Foreign Service life demands a full buy-in from our families 
and those who love us, I want to acknowledge the enduring love 
and support of my family in this career and really in all 
things: my husband Pravesh Singh, who is seated behind me, and 
my children Arya and Xander, who are also joining me today.
    For the past 30 years, Namibia has been a stable, 
democratic country and a model of U.S.-Africa partnership. It 
has continued to build strong institutions and an independent 
judiciary, and typically ranks right at the top in Africa for 
press freedom. Namibia's Government and citizens share many of 
the United States' priorities, including strengthening 
democratic institutions, increasing free trade and investment 
to grow an inclusive economy, promoting human rights, and 
addressing global threats such as climate change. If confirmed, 
I look forward to leading our dynamic team in Windhoek to 
deepen our partnership and further our common interests and 
values.
    I would like to share with you the priorities that, if 
confirmed, I would work hard every day to advance as U.S. 
Ambassador. First and foremost, the welfare of U.S. mission 
colleagues and American citizens is my paramount priority, and 
I will work every day to ensure that our people are serving in 
a workplace that is healthy, is inclusive, and is marked by 
respect. I am excited also for the chance to move our team into 
a new Chancery next year that will provide a better physical 
work environment for all. Also, relationships of trust are a 
key part of diplomacy, I believe, both inside and outside the 
walls of an embassy, and I will invest heavily in building up 
relationships based on respect that produce results for our 
goals.
    My mission team and I will support Namibia as it builds on 
its tradition of good governance. Anti-corruption messaging and 
assistance to fortify Namibia's democracy is a priority for 
both for their government and for ours. Through advocacy and 
partnerships, we will encourage Namibia to fully implement laws 
and policies that respect human rights.
    Namibia also faces threats to its abundant natural 
resources, which are, like our own, vulnerable, in this case to 
exploitation by transnational criminal organizations and 
foreign powers due to insufficient social and legal 
protections. We will partner with Namibia to minimize 
opportunities for corruption and nature crimes and ensure that 
Namibia's ambitions to become a regional transport hub via the 
Walvis Bay Port include strong safeguards against illicit 
activity.
    Both the United States and Namibia seek increased bilateral 
trade and investment. The U.S.-Namibia commercial relationship 
is a growing one, and recent successes show that fostering 
increased trade and investment through mechanisms like the 
African Growth and Opportunity Act, Prosper Africa, Power 
Africa, and other infrastructure and economic initiatives are 
critical components of our efforts to accelerate economic 
development in Namibia. If confirmed, I will facilitate 
commercial relationships and call for a pro-business and pro-
innovation policy for U.S. and Namibian businesses and 
accelerate equitable and inclusive development. Creating 
opportunities for planning and security partnerships will allow 
us to advance our priorities as Namibia grows in strategic 
importance as an anchor for activity in the south Atlantic 
Ocean.
    Finally, if confirmed, I will focus on our continued 
investment in people. Once facing one of the world's highest 
HIV/AIDS prevalence rates, Namibia became a flagship country 
for the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or 
PEPFAR, and it is now one of the few highly affected countries 
in the world nearing epidemic control of HIV/AIDS. Our 
investment of over USD $1 billion in PEPFAR funds to Namibia 
since 2004 has saved lives of thousands and been a force 
multiplier for our bilateral relationship, fostering 
cooperation in many areas in addition to health.
    The next chapter in our partnership with Namibia must 
ensure a resilient, well-equipped, and civically engaged 
population, especially among Namibia's youth. If confirmed, I 
will use our resources to empower current and future 
generations to partner with us to respond to global threats and 
opportunities and to adapt to longer-term economic, social, and 
environmental challenges.
    Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I thank you 
again aid I look forward to answering your questions.

    Senator Cardin. We thank all of you for your comments and 
your observations. We appreciate that very much.
    This committee has a tradition of asking all nominees 
questions about their availability. Some of you have already 
answered this in your presentations. You must have anticipated 
these questions were going to be asked. That is good staff 
work. But I am going to ask each of you to answer yes or no 
individually on the four questions that are asked about 
responsiveness to our committee.
    Do you agree to appear before this committee and make 
officials from your office available to the committee and 
designated staff when invited?
    Ms. Duggal. Yes.
    Ms. Patman. Yes.
    Ms. Aggeler. Yes.
    Mr. Rana. Yes.
    Ambassador Berry. Yes.
    Senator Cardin. Do you commit to keep this committee fully 
and currently informed about the activities under your purview?
    Ms. Duggal. Yes.
    Ms. Patman. Yes.
    Ms. Aggeler. Yes.
    Mr. Rana. Yes.
    Ambassador Berry. Yes.
    Senator Cardin. Do you commit to engaging in meaningful 
consultation with policies that are being developed, not just 
providing notification after the fact?
    Ms. Duggal. Yes.
    Ms. Patman. Yes.
    Ms. Aggeler. Yes.
    Mr. Rana. Yes.
    Ambassador Berry. Yes.
    Senator Cardin. Do you commit to promptly responding to 
requests for briefings and information requested by the 
committee and its designated staff?
    Ms. Duggal. Yes.
    Ms. Patman. Yes.
    Ms. Aggeler. Yes.
    Mr. Rana. Yes.
    Ambassador Berry. Yes.
    Senator Cardin. You all passed. Congratulations.
    As I think has been observed, the five countries that you 
have been nominated to be our representatives are all 
democratic states. So we are dealing with countries that are 
naturally allies of the United States but they have certain 
challenges.
    There are a couple of common concerns that we have. One is 
the dependency on Russian oil, which is today a very important 
consideration. As we know, Russia has weaponized the use of 
energy, and these countries remain very dependent upon Russian 
energy sources. It makes it more challenging for us to have the 
type of leverage to keep unity in our support for Ukraine. In 
the Slovak Republic, I understand 100 percent of their oil is 
imported, and 85 percent of their natural gas. We know in North 
Macedonia it is a large percentage, and in the Netherlands.
    So let me start first with Mr. Rana. How would you go about 
urging the importance of removing that dependency from the 
point of view of the national security not only of the Slovak 
Republic but also of our allies in Europe?
    Mr. Rana. Thank you very much for that question, Senator 
Cardin. You are absolutely right--100 percent of Slovakia's oil 
and nuclear energy, or the fuel, is derived from Russia, and 85 
percent of its natural gas. The most important thing that I 
would do, if confirmed as Ambassador would be to encourage 
Slovakia to integrate within the European Union's own internal 
energy market and diversify fuel types, supply source 
countries, and delivery routes.
    What do we mean by that? One, with the nuclear fuel, try to 
find new suppliers. Right now they are completely dependent on 
the Russians. With natural gas Slovakia has already built 
interconnectors with all of its neighbors. They have contracted 
with the Norwegians to supply natural gas. They have also 
brought in LNG, including from U.S. suppliers. So these are the 
types of activities that we would continue to encourage 
Slovakia and, frankly, all of the European allies, to continue 
doing. Thank you.
    Senator Cardin. Thank you. Ms. Aggeler, there is a similar 
problem in North Macedonia, not quite as great, and as you 
point out, North Macedonia is taking on a leadership within the 
OSCE, which we are very pleased to see. But it also gives us a 
chance for whoever assumes leadership in that organization to 
demonstrate, by action, their commitment to the Helsinki 
principles.
    In North Macedonia the energy issue is one, but also they 
have had some challenges in the rule of law and building that 
capacity. Tell me how you could utilize our position in that 
country, through our mission, particularly as North Macedonia 
ascends in the OSCE.
    Ms. Aggeler. Thank you so much for the question, Chairman 
Cardin, and they are both critical important right now, 
particularly as we look at the fact that just 12 days ago the 
Parliament of North Macedonia passed the required motions to 
begin its EU accession, to accept the French proposals for that 
accession, and as we look to this country and to Albania moving 
forward in the EU.
    First of all, you are absolutely right about the energy 
crisis. North Macedonia is on the verge of declaring an energy 
crisis as of August because of their dependence largely on 
Russian gas. We have already seen efforts throughout our 
mission in Greece, for example, on a Greece-North Macedonia 
interconnector LNG that would not only benefit North Macedonia 
but also many of its neighbors. And there are a number of 
initiatives on clean energy that would assist them to move away 
from the dependency on Russia.
    But your point also about not only OSCE leadership but also 
their EU accession aspirations are critically important and I 
believe offer us an opportunity. And if confirmed, I will do 
everything in my power, Senator, to help them make so many of 
the reforms in rule of law, for example, that will assist that 
country in overall governance, which they so desperately need.
    I was very pleased to read today that the Embassy in Skopje 
announced $4.3 million in additional funding for rule-of-law 
programs across North Macedonia that were a direct result of 
the Strategic Dialogue that we had in June. So those reforms, 
those necessary reforms, I would do everything I could to 
support them. Thank you.
    Senator Cardin. Ms. Duggal, let me complete the issue in 
regard to Russian dependency. There is a similar problem in 
regard to Netherlands. Tell us how you would address that as 
our Ambassador.
    Ms. Duggal. Thank you for the question, Chairman Cardin. 
That is absolutely such a critical thought, and Russia does use 
energy as a weapon to attempt to weaken Europe. The Netherlands 
is, in fact, less dependent on Russian energy than other 
European countries, and the Netherlands does hope to cut 
Russian oil and fossil fuels by the end of the year and aims to 
halt coal imports by August 11th and expand wind and solar.
    The steps they have already taken in the Netherlands, if I 
could list a few, the EU has reached a plan, actually just very 
recently, to cut natural gas by 15 percent between now and 
spring of 2023. They are also using coal-fired stations to 
operate at 35 percent maximum capacity. And there is an 
emergency option in the Netherlands to tap into the Groningen 
gas field, which is the largest in Europe, and reopen, if need. 
And if confirmed, I would be helpful in that conversation.
    Senator Cardin. And we are going to follow up on all these 
issues.
    One of the areas, and particularly as a Senator from 
Maryland, we have an LNG export facility located in our state. 
We know that American LNG is part of the solution of Europe to 
remove their dependency on Russian energy sources, particularly 
natural gas. So these are all areas that are going to have to 
be put into fast gear because some of these issues take a while 
to implement. And it could be a very cold winter in Europe this 
year.
    Senator Hagerty.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Chairman Cardin, and I want to 
stay with you, Ms. Duggal, just to continue my concerns of what 
is happening in the Netherlands. The Netherlands has proven to 
be a significant swing vote in our technological competition 
with the Chinese Communist Party and with China. There is a 
tool company there called ASML. Are you familiar with is?
    Ms. Duggal. Yes.
    Senator Hagerty. ASML produces a special tool known as an 
extreme ultraviolet lithography system. It basically cuts the 
thinnest lines in the world on silicon wafers. These tools--I 
think they cost $150 million a copy--Communist China would love 
to get their hands on these tools. Huawei would like to 
decrease its dependence on other countries because they would 
like to have this capability internalized in China.
    Thankfully, ASML has worked with us, and the Government of 
the Netherlands has worked with us, and Communist China has not 
received a single one of these machines. And that is because 
the Government of the Netherlands has withheld export licenses 
for this to China.
    The Trump administration began this sort of coordination 
between the United States and the Netherlands to persuade them 
on national security grounds not to grant such an export 
license, and the Biden administration has continued this 
policy, which I am very pleased to see. And I would like to 
know, if confirmed, Ms. Duggal, would you commit to fully 
support our efforts to encourage in the Netherlands, and other 
key countries for that matter, to adopt export controls on 
national security grounds that will prevent Chinese companies 
from obtaining and acquiring such critical tools and 
technologies?
    Ms. Duggal. Thank you for the question, sir. Yes, I 
actually am aware of, in the Trump administration, the efforts 
that were made and that were successful, and I also am aware 
that in July of this year there has been lobbying for the older 
DUV systems, and if confirmed, yes, I do commit to that, sir.
    Senator Hagerty. I think it is going to be absolutely 
critical to take every step that we can because the predatory 
posture of China is becoming more and more evident to everyone 
around the globe. But our technology competition is absolutely 
vital. And if you have the opportunity to be confirmed, I think 
your recognition of the national security threat that Communist 
China poses and the fact that you will be representing us to a 
nation that could play a critical role in denying Communist 
China with that capability I think would be vitally important.
    If I could turn my next question to Ms. Patman. As you 
know, Iceland has no armed forces and it depends on the United 
States and NATO for its defense. I am very concerned about 
Russia's increased naval presence in the North Atlantic and I 
am concerned about the frequency of their naval patrols. They 
are levels that we have not seen since the Cold War.
    In 2016, the United States and Iceland agreed on a new 
Joint Defense Declaration. It was aimed at bolstering security 
cooperation, and the United States has been upgrading its 
facilities at Iceland's Keflavik military base. Although 
Iceland's Government has been cooperating with U.S. authorities 
and activities at Keflavik, some Icelandic officials and 
parliamentarians are cautious about our increased presence 
there.
    So if confirmed, how would you work to strengthen the 
defense relationship between the United States and Iceland?
    Ms. Patman. Thank you so much for the question, Senator. I 
would work at the highest levels of the Icelandic Government to 
continue that cooperation and make sure that Iceland understood 
how valued they are and have been for over 70 years as a 
strategic partner. As I am sure you know, their location is so 
pivotal that in World War II we had a base there with troops, 
which we ultimately, thinking that the Cold War was over, 
prematurely as it turns out, withdrew in 2006. But subsequent 
to that time Keflavik, as you are obviously aware, has served 
as a really critical military base for surveillance.
    And in fact, on either side of Iceland are the two maritime 
passages, collectively known as the Greenland-Iceland-UK Gap, 
that are essential be used for NATO surveillance of Russian 
submarines before they drop off into the North Atlantic and 
become untraceable.
    So I am very aware of the aggressions of Russia in that 
region, of their recognition not only that the Arctic is of 
critical importance to them economically, given their oilfields 
and other interests, but they, along with China, are hoping to 
open up the northern sea route and shorten shipping times, and 
the northern sea route goes directly through the Greenland-
Iceland-UK Gap, which makes that surveillance so important and 
makes allied control of that location so very important.
    So I too have become extremely aware of all the different 
Russian aggressions, military and economic, involving Iceland, 
and I do commit to work very faithfully with the Icelandic 
Government to manage those aggressions and make sure they do 
not jeopardize either Icelandic or American security.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you for that response.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Cardin. Mr. Berry, I want to talk a little bit 
about Namibia. It is a bright spot on the African continent, so 
let me start by acknowledging that. They are ranked 58 out of 
180 in the ranking on the 2021 Corruption Index, which is the 
sixth-best score in Africa. But as I assume you are aware, they 
recently had a major scandal in their fishing quotas, dubbed 
the ``Fishrot,'' in which government officials were engaged in 
corruption.
    We recognize that corruption is one of the major ways in 
which democratic states become very vulnerable. So how can you 
use the resources of our mission to help strengthen their 
commitment for anti-corruption activities within their country?
    Ambassador Berry. Thank you, Senator Cardin, for that 
question. I think there is no doubt that corrupt practices, 
particularly when they involve government officials who are 
betraying the trust of the people, poses one of the greatest 
threats to democracy, and I think the Fishrot scandal obviously 
has laid bare some of the vulnerabilities that Namibia's young 
democracy faces here.
    I think there are a couple of things that I would point to 
as encouraging signs there. First of all, the corruption was 
largely uncovered through a free and independent media. Second 
of all, the Government took positive action in sacking those 
who were responsible or accused through that process and have 
moved them to trial.
    I think that as the United States Government we have a 
grave and solemn commitment to help support them in those 
efforts. I think through training, through our regional hub for 
the International Law Enforcement Academy, through other types 
of assistance to help ensure that sunshine and daylight, 
transparency and accountability is really the coin of the 
realm.
    I think that by emphasizing in personal relationships and 
engagements through our programmatic involvement as well, 
emphasizing that which binds us most closely, these elements of 
a democratic society, will be the best guarantee that we have 
in helping them combat this scourge.
    Senator Cardin. Thank you for that answer.
    Ms. Patman, I want to follow up on the issue of Arctic 
security because I really do think Senator Hagerty's point is 
one that is of critical importance. Russia is anything but 
predictable, other than we know that they want to bring down 
democratic states and they want to expand their influence. That 
we know. The Arctic is an area of major interest for Russia, 
and Iceland depends upon NATO. They do not have a capacity 
themselves, in armed forces. They do have some capacity on the 
coast.
    So how do you sort of help develop the strategies, 
recognizing Russia's brazen aggression now, that nothing is off 
the table? How do we strengthen that alliance so that we have a 
greater Arctic defense than we currently have, recognizing that 
Russia feels rather emboldened in that area?
    Ms. Patman. Thank you for the question, and I certainly am 
ready to meet that challenge, if confirmed as Ambassador to 
Iceland. Iceland, as we talked earlier, does play a critical 
geostrategic role, and the whole attitude toward Russia, in my 
understanding in Iceland, has completely changed in light of 
the aggression in Ukraine. I think the Foreign Minister spoke 
at the Wilson Institute here in Washington recently, and talked 
about how it has changed everything. They are absolutely on red 
alert about the threat Russia poses and they are ready to 
engage in all measures necessary to thwart that kind of 
aggression. Not only have they have been totally supportive of 
the sanctions, giving humanitarian aid, accepting refugees, and 
a number of other ways to help in Ukraine, they also recognize, 
and have actually acknowledged, the possible need for enhanced 
security presence with respect to NATO security.
    Now I will say that Iceland plays above its weight. Iceland 
really does contribute to NATO in many incredibly valuable 
ways. The Icelandic Coast Guard operates the Keflavik Air Base. 
We have a number of installations in Iceland, including a radio 
transmitter facility at Grindavik that the United States has 
there, and there are military exercises in the Arctic to ensure 
interoperability should there be a problem there, just to name 
a few examples of how Iceland does contribute handsomely to 
NATO.
    So I would say that yes, it is true that under their 
security agreement with the United States and under their 
agreement with NATO we are responsible for their security, but 
they also contribute to ours as well, and I always like to 
recognize that.
    Senator Cardin. Thank you. Senator Hagerty?
    Senator Hagerty. If I might just add one more question. 
This is for Mr. Berry, and again a concern about China's 
predatory presence in Africa, broadly speaking. They have 
aggressively used their debt trap diplomacy to move into 
Africa, and I am very concerned about the posture they are 
adopting with regard to lithium. And China is on track, if 
nothing is done about it, to control 75 percent of the world's 
lithium supply in just a few more years, by 2030.
    In Namibia, all the active uranium mines are majority 
Chinese owned, and China has invested $4.7 billion in a uranium 
mining project that is one of the largest investments that 
China has in Africa. So I would love to hear what your 
perspective is on the Chinese Communist Party's activities in 
Namibia and what you would foresee, if you are confirmed, what 
you would foresee as your response to that.
    Ambassador Berry. Thank you, Senator, for that question. 
You know, for the last 4 years I have been leading a team in a 
country that shares a border with China so I have become 
acutely familiar with many of the Chinese predatory policies, 
its use of disinformation, for example, to target the 
relationships through the predatory lending that I think has 
troubled so many states around the world.
    I think what I have learned from that is that the best 
vaccination against those kinds of predatory or unhelpful 
interventions in any country, Namibia included, is for full 
transparency and full visibility on arrangements around deals 
on the extractive industries, on any kind of investment. I 
think that we lean very heavily into our shared role as 
democracies around the world. I believe that, if confirmed, 
what the United States can bring into looking at investment in 
the extractive industries or bringing greater scrutiny and 
greater clarity on the arrangements of those deals really is at 
the core of what we can do there.
    I believe that in Nepal we have seen the Chinese Government 
really attack U.S. programming by the deployment of 
misinformation, and if confirmed, I will work every day to 
promote private sector engagement, to provide greater clarity 
on these deals, and to engage in the common-sense and, I think, 
extremely useful engagement of building up relationships. I 
think that an investment of our time, our energy, our focus, 
and working on the fundamentals of the extractive industries 
there will give us some new insight on how we can compete. It 
is, obviously, a great concern to me.
    Senator Hagerty. To be clear, Ambassador, you would be 
supportive them of U.S. private sector involvement in the 
extractive industries there, in Namibia?
    Ambassador Berry. Absolutely, Senator. I think whether you 
look at Namibia's potential in developing its green power 
sources, the rare earth minerals, the lithium, uranium that you 
mentioned, or even to develop the potential of petroleum 
discoveries, I would sure as heck rather see American companies 
develop those resources, because I think that we can do it 
better, I think the technology supports it, and I think we can 
do it in a way that is environmentally sensitive, which is also 
a high priority for the Namibian Government.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you.
    Senator Cardin. And I would just urge you, in the 
extractive industries, to recognize that it is utilized too 
often for corruption. And I have been to Namibia and I think 
they are committed to an honest system, but the more 
transparency that we have in the process, the stronger that is 
going to be as these relationships are developed.
    Ambassador Berry. Thank you, Senator. I agree.
    Senator Cardin. The committee record will remain open until 
close of business on Friday, July 29, for members of the 
committee that may have ask questions for the record. We would 
urge you all to try to answer those questions as promptly and 
as completely as possible because until that process is 
completed the committee cannot schedule the next step in the 
confirmation process. So we would ask that you cooperate with 
the committee, and again we thank you very much for your 
willingness to put up with this process and to serve our 
nation.
    And with that the committee stands adjourned.


    [Whereupon, at 3:12 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]



                              ----------                              



              Additional Material Submitted for the Record


            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
      Submitted to Shefali Razdan Duggal by Senator James E. Risch

Democracy, and Human Rights
    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Human Rights report, the 
Netherlands was noted for violence or threats of violence against 
journalists, crimes and threats motivated by anti-Semitism, threats of 
racial violence, and threats of violence against LGBT communities. 
Authorities of the kingdom identified, investigated, prosecuted, and 
punished officials who committed abuses.

   What is your assessment of the efficacy of the Government in 
        identifying and punishing officials committing human rights 
        abuses?

    Answer. The Government of the Netherlands has demonstrated efficacy 
and a strong commitment to promoting and protecting human rights, 
including as a member state in the U.N. Human Rights Council (HRC). The 
Netherlands has also worked hard to identify and punish officials who 
commit human rights abuses. If confirmed, I intend to work with the 
Government of Netherlands to keep the issues of human rights and 
religious freedoms at the forefront of our bilateral agenda. I would 
call upon the Government to hold accountable perpetrators of such 
threats. I would also encourage the Dutch Government to continue to 
support community-based initiatives promoting tolerance and 
inclusivity.

    Question. If confirmed, what actions would you take with host 
government to address violations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would call upon the Government to hold 
accountable perpetrators of human rights abuses. I would also encourage 
the Dutch Government to continue to support community-based initiatives 
promoting tolerance and inclusivity.

    Question. If confirmed, how would you direct your mission to 
bolster civil society and respect for human rights in country?

    Answer. As President Biden has said, the United States is ready to 
work with partners and allies to help lead the world toward a more 
peaceful, prosperous future grounded in respect for human dignity. I 
have been a long-time committee member of Human Rights Watch and 
defending human rights has been a key priority of mine. If confirmed, I 
would work with the relevant offices in the U.S. Mission, including 
with the Public Affairs Section, to work with civil society 
organizations that advocate for human rights. I would utilize our many 
public diplomacy tools, such as exchanges, cultural programs, and media 
engagement, to highlight and share best practices.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons 
report, the Netherlands remained a Tier 1 country for meeting the 
standards for the elimination of trafficking, maintaining significant 
efforts to do so. However, the Government's efforts on the Dutch 
Caribbean islands remained weak, and the Government did not report 
complete victim statistics for the reporting.

   If confirmed, how could you work with the host government improve 
        efforts in the Dutch Caribbean islands?

    Answer. Embassy The Hague works closely with the Dutch Government 
to share our concerns about trafficking in persons in the Dutch 
Caribbean, and the Embassy contributes to our Congressionally mandated 
reporting on conditions there. If confirmed, I would coordinate with 
U.S. Embassy leadership in the Caribbean, the Dutch Government, senior 
State and Justice Department officials, and Congressional leadership to 
encourage increased efforts against trafficking in the Dutch Caribbean.

    Question. What steps could you take to encourage the host 
government to increase the level of victim statistics reported?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would encourage the Government of the 
Netherlands to provide accurate and comprehensive reporting and 
statistics of their work to address trafficking problems. I would also 
lead the U.S. Mission in the Netherlands to work with journalists, 
civil society, advocates, academics, and survivors, who are vital 
contributors to our understanding of this terrible crime.


    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, the Netherlands constitution prohibits religious 
discrimination and protects the freedom of individuals to profess their 
religion or beliefs. However, some local politicians have made anti-
Islamic and antisemitic statements. Some Jewish groups have expressed 
concern over rising anti-Semitism through vandalism of Jewish 
monuments, antisemitic chants at soccer matches, and vandalism 
involving text sprayed with swastikas.

   What is your assessment of anti-Semitism in the country?

    Answer. The Dutch constitution prohibits religious discrimination 
and protects the freedom of individuals to profess their religion or 
belief. Dutch ministers have spoken out against antisemitism and have 
appointed a National Coordinator for Countering Antisemitism. However, 
there is still more to be done to address religious intolerance and 
discrimination, including antisemitism. As a former member of the 
United States Holocaust Museum Memorial Council, for which I continue 
to serve as a Regional Western Advisor, confronting antisemitism and 
defending human rights has been a primary focus and, if confirmed, 
would be one of my highest priorities. If confirmed, I commit to 
working closely with the Office of International Religious Freedom and 
Special Envoys for Monitoring and Combating Antisemitism and for 
Holocaust Issues to push back effectively on antisemitism.

    Question. If confirmed, how could you work with the host government 
to address these concerns?

    Answer. Officials from U.S. Embassy The Hague and Consulate General 
Amsterdam engage in interfaith dialogue, formally and informally, with 
government officials, religious leaders, youth activists, and other 
civil society groups to highlight the need for religious tolerance. If 
confirmed, I pledge to work closely with these stakeholders and in 
coordination with colleagues in Washington to highlight the need for 
religious tolerance.

International Organizations
    Question. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the U.N., including in elections 
for specialized bodies like the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who if 
elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. 
She is in a tough race that will require early, consistent engagement 
across capitals and within the U.N. member states.

   If confirmed, do you commit to demarching the Netherlands 
        Government and any other counterparts necessary to encourage 
        their support of Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. Absolutely. If confirmed, I would encourage the Netherlands 
to support Doreen Bogdan-Martin. It is vitally important that key 
international organizations like the International Telecommunications 
Union are led by capable individuals committed to upholding the 
integrity of the rules-based international order. Ms. Bogdan-Martin is 
clearly the most qualified candidate for Secretary-General of the ITU. 
I will encourage the Netherlands not only to vote for Ms. Bogdan-Martin 
at the upcoming ITU Plenipotentiary Conference in September, but to 
encourage other ITU member states to do the same.

    Question. If confirmed, how can you work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify, recruit, 
and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior Program 
Officer (JPO) program at the U.N.?

    Answer. Ensuring that the United States and our like-minded allies 
and partners do not cede influence in the U.N. system to those who do 
not share our values and are not committed to the foundational 
principles of the U.N. is of vital importance to U.S. foreign policy 
and national security interests. If confirmed, I will work hand-in-
glove with the International Organizations Bureau, the Government of 
the Netherlands, and other stakeholders to augment the number of 
Americans while encouraging citizens of likeminded nations to work 
throughout the U.N. system. I would also work with the Embassy's Public 
Affairs Section to identify, recruit, and install qualified Americans 
to the U.N.

Europe and Eurasia
    Question. The Netherlands has a high rate of voting coincidence 
with the U.S. in the U.N. General Assembly and in the Security Council.

   If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to engage with the 
        Netherlands Government on anticipated votes in the U.N. system 
        that would continue to build upon this record with the U.S.?

    Answer. The Netherlands is closely aligned with the United States 
across the spectrum of foreign policy, national security, and economic 
issues, and we should take full advantage of this close alignment to 
advance U.S. interests. If confirmed, I would ensure that my team and I 
maintain regular contact with Dutch counterparts to ensure maximum 
coordination on upcoming votes and other actions in the U.N. and other 
multilateral bodies, including actions to stand with Ukraine and 
further isolate Russia in the international system.

    Question. The Netherlands hosts the International Criminal Court, 
the main body that implements the Rome Statute. The United States is 
not a party to the Rome Statute.

   If confirmed, do you commit to working with the Ambassador for 
        Global Criminal Justice Van Schaak and Under Secretary Zeya to 
        protect American interests in the context of the ICC?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I would absolutely work closely with 
Ambassador Van Schaack and Under Secretary Zeya to protect our 
interests in the context of the ICC. The Dutch are proud hosts of the 
ICC and led efforts to hold Russia to account for human rights abuses 
in Ukraine during a recent Accountability Conference. As a court of 
last resort, the ICC has a critical role to play in the international 
system of justice and the USG supports constructive engagement aimed at 
supporting the Court's mandate, which is a key priority for the 
President.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you engage with Congress on ICC 
issues, including any new or rumored investigations of the U.S., 
Israel, or other allies who are also not a party to the Rome Statue?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would work closely with Washington 
colleagues, Global Criminal Justice Ambassador-at-Large Van Schaack, 
Under Secretary Zeya, and with Embassy The Hague's Office of Legal 
Counselor (OLC) to address any concerns related to the ICC. The United 
States continues to maintain its longstanding objection to efforts by 
the Court to assert jurisdiction over personnel of non-States, Parties 
such as the United States and Israel, but believes that any concerns 
are best addressed through engagement with all stakeholders.

State Department Management and Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Amsterdam?

    Answer. Mission the Netherlands comprises our Embassy in The Hague 
and the Consulate General in Amsterdam. My understanding is that our 
Mission faces staffing shortages among our locally employed hires. Our 
Consulate General in Amsterdam provides consular services for the 
country including non-immigrant and immigrant visas and American 
Citizen Services for both tourists and more than 45,000 Americans 
citizens who reside in The Netherlands. If confirmed, I would make 
every effort to regularly meet with the staff to understand any 
concerns they may have and address any morale issues that may arise.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Amsterdam?

    Answer. Mission Netherlands has very high morale. If confirmed, the 
welfare of all Americans and my staff would be my top priority; I would 
do my utmost to keep morale high at both posts, including by addressing 
staffing gaps. I would seek frank input and feedback from the staff at 
Consulate General Amsterdam, enthusiastically recognize their 
contributions and accomplishments, and work assiduously with my Consul 
General and my management team to address any concerns they may have.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Amsterdam?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would use my experience building bridges to 
maintain close communication among staff at the Embassy and Consulate 
General. In addition to the established, regular meetings between the 
Embassy and Consulate General, I would work to communicate a unified 
mission and vision, be inclusive and open, and encourage more frequent 
interactions among staff. The Consulate General in Amsterdam is 
uniquely located on Museumplein--the heart of a world-class city. We 
have an opportunity to leverage this presence as a strategic platform 
to advance Mission priorities.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I have always striven to forge inclusive, open environments 
where individuals feel empowered and develop a shared sense of 
responsibility. When conflicts arise, I work to resolve them 
professionally and with respect for all parties involved. I look to 
delegate authority, but not responsibility, as often as possible. If 
confirmed, I would bring my optimistic attitude along with a 
collaborative and team-focused management style to the mission.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No, this type of behavior is not acceptable. If confirmed, 
I will work to resolve issues professionally and with respect for all 
parties involved.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work to build a relationship of trust 
and respect with the Deputy Chief of Mission, delegating when 
appropriate and ensuring the individual can cover for me in the event I 
am not available.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I plan to let my Deputy Chief of Mission 
serve as the Embassy's chief management officer, responsible for the 
day-to-day functions of the Mission. If confirmed and after I arrive at 
post, I will work out the details with the Deputy Chief of Mission of 
our respective portfolios to form the basis of a collaborative, 
productive relationship.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Yes. Candid and comprehensive performance reviews are 
essential for employees to know where they stand and for them to 
understand where they need to improve. Beyond the annual reviews, it is 
also important for supervisors to set clear expectations and provide 
continuous feedback.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes. Ensuring clear, accurate, and direct feedback for 
employees will raise their overall performance. I will enthusiastically 
recognize the accomplishments of high-performing employees.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
the Netherlands.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. Yes. Diplomats in Embassy The Hague enjoy a free range of 
movement throughout the country to establish a breadth of contacts and 
complete their work. If confirmed, I would commit to continue this 
practice of getting outside of the Embassy to meet with local actors, 
including host government officials, non-government organizations and 
fellow foreign diplomats stationed in the Netherlands.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. Diplomats working in Embassy The Hague already enjoy a free 
range of movement throughout the country. If confirmed, I will work to 
ensure they continue to leave the Embassy to meet with Dutch officials 
and other citizens throughout the country as often as possible. I will 
also work closely with Diplomatic Security to monitor the security 
situation in case there are any changes to the permissive security 
environment that allows Mission staff to travel throughout the 
Netherlands. If confirmed, one of my key priorities will be to visit 
each of the 12 provinces and substantively engage with the local Dutch 
population to convey and exemplify our American ideals.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in the 
Netherlands?

    Answer. Embassy The Hague uses the full array of public diplomacy 
tools to engage with the Dutch public across all facets of society, 
including educational and professional exchanges, cultural and sports 
diplomacy programs, and grants to local non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs).

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. Working in a country such as the Netherlands, with an open 
media environment, freedom of the press, and freedom of expression, 
U.S. diplomats face few constraints. If confirmed, I will work to help 
ensure that this trend continues and will work energetically with my 
Public Diplomacy Section to ensure that our public diplomacy efforts 
deepen our bilateral people-to-people ties and advance U.S. strategic 
priorities in and with the Netherlands.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will direct my public diplomacy officers to 
continue to shape and advance U.S. messages in country in a smart, 
balanced manner, which will require them to coordinate and collaborate 
closely with colleagues in Main State.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Absolutely. The issue of Anomalous Health Incidents--
including the interagency effort to protect and care for our personnel 
and uncover the cause of these incidents--is an absolute priority for 
the Department. AHIs have been a top priority for Secretary Blinken, 
who set clear goals for the Health Incident Response Task Force to 
strengthen the Department's communication with the workforce, provide 
care for affected employees and family members, and better protect 
against these events in the future as we work to uncover the cause. If 
confirmed, I would have no higher priority than the safety of the 
members of my Embassy team and their families.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Amsterdam personnel?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I commit to talking openly with Embassy 
The Hague and Consulate General Amsterdam. I believe that we will be 
better suited to advance our goals through frequent, honest, and 
transparent communication.

                   follow-up questions submitted to 
                 shefali razdan duggal by senator risch
          Question. The Netherlands is a major hub for natural gas 
        trade, and has significant stores in the Groningen field that 
        could be used to alleviate gas shortages in Europe. If 
        confirmed to be ambassador, how will you work with the 
        Government of the Netherlands as it, and its European Union 
        partners, navigates the burgeoning European energy crisis?

          Answer. The Netherlands has taken many important actions to 
        enhance European energy security and support diversification of 
        energy supplies. Raising production at the Groningen gas fields 
        is challenging because operations there trigger earthquakes. If 
        confirmed, I will work closely with the Government of the 
        Netherlands and colleagues in Washington to support bilateral 
        and multilateral efforts to improve European energy security 
        and reduce European dependence on Russian fossil fuels. I will 
        also support other bilateral and multilateral efforts to reduce 
        the use of fossil fuels in the long-term.

          Question. How will you work with the Dutch Government to 
        modernize and diversify its gas and energy industry away from 
        Russia?

          Answer. The Government of the Netherlands has been proactive 
        in seeking alternative energy sources to those supplied by 
        Russia, including by speeding up their transition to 
        sustainable sources of energy; increasing the use of hydrogen 
        and responsibly-sourced gas; installing additional wind 
        turbines in the North Sea; and securing additional 
        infrastructure to support diversification of natural gas 
        supplies. If confirmed, I will work closely with the Dutch 
        Government to further those important efforts.

          Question. How will you work with the Netherlands' Government 
        and private sector to increase economic ties with the United 
        States?

          Answer. The United States and the Netherlands have a robust 
        bilateral commercial and economic relationship, and in 2021 the 
        United States had an $18 billion trade surplus with the 
        Netherlands. The Netherlands is also one of the largest foreign 
        investors in the United States, supporting over 800,000 direct 
        and indirect American jobs. The Netherlands has invested in 
        many sectors of the U.S. economy, including electronics/high-
        tech, life sciences and health, transportation, logistics, 
        financial services, petrochemicals, agriculture, horticulture, 
        energy, and water management. If confirmed, I will engage with 
        the Dutch Government and private sector to strengthen existing 
        relationships and identify new opportunities for trade and 
        investment.

          Question. As Ambassador, how will you work to build people-
        to-people ties between the U.S. and the Netherlands?

          Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to working with the 
        Public Diplomacy Section to strengthen the already deep and 
        enduring people-to-people ties between the United States and 
        the Netherlands. I believe deepening these ties will help to 
        advance the four priorities that the United States shares with 
        the Netherlands: 1) to enhance Transatlantic security 
        cooperation; 2) to promote our shared economic prosperity; 3) 
        to highlight the U.S.-Netherlands climate partnership; and 4) 
        to safeguard our shared democratic values, promote diversity, 
        equity, inclusion, and accessibility, and protect human rights. 
        If confirmed, one of my key priorities will be to visit each of 
        the 12 provinces and substantively engage with the local Dutch 
        population to convey and exemplify our American ideals.

          Question. If confirmed, how will you work with the Dutch 
        Government to protect critical industry, such as semiconductor 
        development and manufacturing, from foreign espionage and 
        intellectual property theft, especially from China?

          Answer. The Netherlands is one of the most technologically-
        advanced countries in Europe and one of the United States' most 
        like-minded partners on digital governance and cyber security. 
        If confirmed, I will continue our cooperation with the 
        Netherlands to promote and protect critical and emerging 
        technologies, such as semiconductor technology, in which the 
        Netherlands is a world leader.

          Question. If confirmed, how will you work with the Government 
        of the Netherlands to coordinate and implement sanctions on 
        Russia and support aid to Ukraine? To ensure sanctions 
        compliance and crack down on any attempts to evade sanctions?

          Answer. The Netherlands has emerged as a leader within Europe 
        to hold Russia to account for its war against Ukraine, 
        supporting several rounds of EU sanctions against the Kremlin, 
        supplying security and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, and 
        continuing to shape and mold a strong EU response to Russia's 
        aggression. Prime Minister Rutte has been a strong leader 
        within the EU, as well as in the region. If confirmed, I plan 
        to build upon sound U.S.-EU-Dutch coordination to deter Russian 
        malign influence globally, including through the provision of 
        security assistance to Ukraine, development of further economic 
        sanctions, and coordination in multilateral organizations to 
        hold Russia to account.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
       Submitted to Shefali Razdan Duggal by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. Our European allies and NATO members must recognize the 
need to take the lead to counter Russia's aggression on their doorstep. 
Officials from the past and current administrations have agreed that 
the CCP is the only power willing and able to challenge U.S. leadership 
on the global stage. In practice, this means undermining our open 
system here at home and undermining our alliances and credibility 
abroad. While CCP is most interested in becoming a regional hegemon in 
the Indo-Pacific, they have global and European aspirations. In July 
2019, the Dutch government decided to add additional vetting 
requirements to their telecommunications companies regarding equipment 
suppliers to fifth generation (5G) mobile networks.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. The President has made it clear the United States views the 
PRC as a strategic competitor that challenges the existing rules-based 
international order. The Netherlands shares U.S. concerns with PRC 
behavior that undermines international norms and European security. The 
Netherlands does not allow untrusted vendors in their 5G network and 
its parliament was the first to pass a resolution labeling the 
situation in Xinjiang as a ``genocide.'' If confirmed, I will work with 
the Netherlands to address the risks that could impact U.S. and Dutch 
interests, so that we can better compete with the PRC.

    Question. How have Dutch views of the CCP changed in recent years 
given the significant trade between the two nations?

    Answer. Dutch views increasingly reflect the threats posed by the 
PRC to our economic security, regional stability, shared values, and 
the international rules-based order. While the Dutch pursue cooperation 
with the PRC where they have shared interests, they do so while 
remaining mindful of security and economic concerns. They share our 
concerns over the PRC's unfair trade practices, especially the use of 
forced labor, and recognize the threat of strategic dependency on the 
PRC.

    Question. U.S. relations with the Netherlands are generally 
regarded positively. How do you assess the current state of the 
bilateral relationship and how can the U.S. utilize the Dutch 
historical relationships in the Indo-Pacific region to counter CCP 
further expansion?

    Answer. The U.S.-Netherlands bilateral relationship is strong, 
based on shared values and excellent people-to-people ties. The Dutch 
share many of our views about the challenge the PRC poses to our vision 
of a free, open and prosperous Indo Pacific as evidenced by their China 
policy and their engagement in shaping the European Union's approach to 
the region. If confirmed, I would work with the Netherlands to advance 
our shared interests in the Indo-Pacific.

    Question. The Netherlands strongly supports NATO and transatlantic 
relations. Dutch forces continue to participate in NATO operations and 
supported NATO efforts to support Ukraine's defense against Putin's war 
by providing both lethal and non-lethal weapons. The Dutch are well 
aware of the abuses that Russia is capable of given the downing of 
flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine by pro-Russian separatists killing 
close to 300 Dutch citizens. To what extent has Putin's aggression in 
Ukraine boosted political momentum in the Netherlands toward meeting 
NATO's requirement for members to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP 
on defense spending?

    Answer. The current Dutch governing coalition has already announced 
that the Netherlands will meet the Wales Defense Investment pledge of 
spending two percent of GDP on defense by 2024. If confirmed, I will 
work with the Government of the Netherlands to sustain this commitment 
and ensure that the Dutch continue to contribute substantially to 
transatlantic security.

    Question. Will you press the Netherlands to meet the 2 percent 
requirement and sustain it over time?

    Answer. The current Dutch governing coalition has already announced 
that the Netherlands will meet the Wales Defense Investment pledge of 
spending two percent of GDP on defense by 2024. If confirmed, I will 
work with the Government of the Netherlands to sustain this commitment 
and ensure that the Dutch continue to be a major contributor to 
transatlantic security.

    Question. If so, how will you be effective in this endeavor?

    Answer. The United States continues to enjoy a close relationship 
with the Netherlands, based on shared values and a shared vision for 
the future. Like the United States, they are deeply committed to NATO. 
If confirmed, I plan to rely on this incredibly close relationship to 
advance U.S. goals and priorities with respect to the Netherlands.

    Question. To what degree does the Netherlands support cooperation 
with the United States, including at NATO and with the EU, to address 
the strategic and economic challenges posed by CCP?

    Answer. The Netherlands strongly supports cooperation with the 
United States in NATO and with the EU to address strategic and economic 
challenges posed by the PRC. They are a capable NATO ally and a strong 
contributor to maritime security. They are also a strong voice in 
shaping the EU's more critical approach to the PRC. They work closely 
with the United States to promote and protect leading edge 
technologies, and their parliament was the first in Europe to label the 
situation in Xinjiang a genocide. If confirmed, I will work to deepen 
this cooperation with the Dutch.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
             to Carrin F. Patman by Senator James E. Risch

Democracy and Human Rights
    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Human Rights report, 
Iceland did not report any significant issues of human rights abuses. 
The Government had mechanisms in place in order to prosecute and punish 
officials who carried out these abuses or engaged in corruption.

   How could you work with Icelandic Government to maintain their 
        human rights record?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would regularly engage with the Icelandic 
Government to maintain its strong human rights record, through meetings 
and outreach with counterparts in the Government and throughout civil 
society. I would also ensure the Embassy regularly engages on this 
issue.

    Question. If confirmed, what steps would you take with the host 
government to help spread these practices to neighboring countries and 
around the world?

    Answer. Iceland is a strong advocate for addressing global issues 
in multilateral fora. If confirmed, I will work to leverage our strong 
bilateral relationship and shared values to help share Iceland's strong 
human rights practices with neighboring countries and around the world, 
including through cooperation during the Summit for Democracy's Year of 
Action. If confirmed, I would utilize public diplomacy tools to promote 
the international rules-based order and bolster human rights.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons 
report, Iceland remained a Tier 1 country for meeting the standards for 
the elimination of trafficking, maintaining significant efforts to do 
so. However, the Government continued to charge suspected traffickers 
under non-trafficking statutes such as smuggling, which carry more 
lenient penalties and did not have a formal process for identifying 
victims of child-trafficking.

   If confirmed, how could you work with the host government to 
        continue to improve these efforts to eliminate trafficking?

    Answer. From reviewing this year's TIP report, I understand that 
the Government of Iceland fully meets the minimum standards for the 
elimination of trafficking. According to the report, the Government 
made key achievements during the reporting period, considering the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Government prosecuted and 
convicted one trafficker, marking the Government's first prosecution 
and conviction in 12 years, and established a law enforcement advisory 
panel. In addition, the Government identified and assisted more 
potential trafficking victims and funded a new counseling and support 
center for victims of gender-based violence, including trafficking 
victims. The Government also funded and published a new online 
emergency services portal with information on trafficking indicators 
and assistance, developed standard operating procedures for emergency 
services operators responding to suspected trafficking cases, and 
financed production of educational videos to help workplace inspectors 
detect potential incidents of human trafficking. If confirmed, I look 
forward to working with Iceland to continue efforts on this important 
issue.

    Question. What steps could you take to increase the rate of 
traffickers being charged under trafficking statutes?

    Answer. Iceland has made key achievements in this past reporting 
period, which if confirmed, I look forward to building on. As noted in 
this year's TIP report, the Icelandic Government prosecuted and 
convicted one trafficker, marking the Government's first prosecution 
and conviction in 12 years. The Government also established a law 
enforcement advisory panel that worked with foreign law enforcement 
agencies and anti-trafficking organizations and cooperated with 
international organizations on data collection regarding trafficking 
trends and responses. If confirmed, I would leverage the TIP Report as 
the primary guide for U.S. anti-trafficking policy and encourage the 
Icelandic Government to implement the TIP Report's prioritized 
recommendations, including to significantly increase efforts to convict 
suspected traffickers and sentence them to significant prison terms, 
investigate and prosecute trafficking cases under the trafficking 
statute, and enhance training for investigating cases and collecting 
evidence against suspected traffickers.

    Question. How could you work with the Icelandic Government to 
establish formal processes for identifying child-trafficking victims?

    Answer. Although Iceland made key achievements in this past 
reporting period, the Icelandic Government did not have a formal 
identification and referral process for child trafficking victims. If 
confirmed, I will engage with the Icelandic Government, civil society 
organizations, and the State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat 
Trafficking in Persons to encourage cooperation to establish formal 
processes for Iceland to identify child-trafficking victims.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, Iceland provides for freedom of religion. Religious 
report generally good relations with the Government and society at 
large, however Jewish community leaders have noticed an uptick in 
antisemitic rhetoric on social media.

   What is your assessment of anti-Semitism in the country?

    Answer. As you note, according to the State Department's most 
recent International Religious Freedom report, religious groups in 
Iceland reported generally good relations with the Government and 
society at large. However, Jewish community leaders noted a slight 
uptick in antisemitic rhetoric on social media, and one incident 
involving a verbal confrontation. If confirmed, I plan to meet with 
community leaders of all faiths, civil society organizations, and 
government officials in Iceland to discuss religious equality and 
religious tolerance in Iceland, and I plan to utilize social media to 
highlight the importance of religious freedom.

    Question. If confirmed, how could you work with the host government 
to address these concerns?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would regularly engage with the Icelandic 
Government to address any crimes against religious minorities, through 
meetings and outreach with counterparts in the Government and 
throughout society. I would also ensure the Embassy regularly engages 
on this issue.

International Organizations
    Question. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the U.S., including in elections 
for specialized bodies like the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who if 
elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. 
She is in a tough race that will require early, consistent engagement 
across capitals and within the U.S. member states.

   If confirmed, do you commit to demarching the Iceland Government 
        and any other counterparts necessary to encourage their support 
        of Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I commit to demarching the Icelandic 
Government and any other counterparts necessary to communicate U.S. 
support of Doreen Bogdan-Martin.

    Question. If confirmed, how can you work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify, recruit, 
and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior Program 
Officer (JPO) program at the U.S.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would coordinate closely with and engage 
the International Organizations bureau at the Department of State to 
ensure that the United States is readily able to identify, recruit, and 
install qualified Americans at the U.S. and in other specialized 
international bodies. I believe in continued open communication and if 
confirmed, I commit to meeting IO officials at the Department to 
discuss ways I can be helpful in this regard.

Europe and Eurasia
    Question. Iceland has a high rate of voting coincidence with the 
U.S. in the U.S. General Assembly and in the Security Council.

   If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to engage with the 
        Iceland Government on anticipated votes in the U.S. system that 
        would continue to build upon this record with the U.S.?

    Answer. Iceland is a U.S. ally that shares many values and 
priorities, and is a stable and democratic country with longstanding 
close ties to the United States. Iceland is also a strong advocate for 
addressing global issues in multilateral fora. If confirmed, I commit 
to continuously engaging with the Icelandic Government and will work to 
leverage the strong bilateral relationship and shared values to 
continue to build upon this record.

State Department Management and Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Reykjavik?

    Answer. Mission Reykjavik has faced challenges posed by COVID-19, 
and I am thankful for the staff's resilience and continued service. If 
confirmed, the health and safety of the personnel and family members of 
Mission Reykjavik will be my top priority, and I look forward to 
working with the talented team of U.S. Direct Hires, locally employed 
staff, and their families, and ensuring that everyone on my team 
understands they are valued and has my support.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Reykjavik?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will ensure everyone on my team is treated 
professionally, their rights are respected, they are safe and secure, 
and they have the resources necessary to perform their jobs. We are all 
one team working for the good of the U.S.-Icelandic relationship and 
the interests of the United States and the American people.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Reykjavik?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to ensuring open and 
continuous communication throughout the Mission. We are all one team 
working together to advance the U.S.-Icelandic relationship and the 
interests of the American people, so I will ensure this collaborative 
service focus is central to our work. Furthermore, I am committed to 
supporting a diverse and inclusive workforce at U.S. Embassy Reykjavik. 
Diversity makes the Mission strong by bringing different perspectives 
and enhancing creativity and if confirmed, I look forward to working 
with the team to maximize innovation and effectiveness.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I have been blessed with opportunities that have prepared 
me to be a chief of mission, and to build consensus among diverse 
stakeholders. I have demonstrated an ability to work with colleagues of 
all backgrounds and if confirmed, I will regularly engage with members 
of my team and always seek to create a space for open dialogue and 
diversity of thought. I also believe in leading by example. If 
confirmed, I will work hard to foster an environment of respect as 
Embassy Reykjavik carries out important work on behalf of the American 
people.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No, it is never acceptable or constructive to berate 
subordinates, either in public or private.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to a close and productive 
relationship with the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM). If confirmed, I 
will work closely with the DCM to advance U.S. priorities in Iceland, 
including protecting the safety and security of Americans, expanding 
our economic relationship, and advancing shared priorities.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will entrust the Deputy Chief of Mission 
with responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the Mission and 
serve as Charge d'Affaires in my absence. If confirmed, I will consult 
closely with the Deputy Chief of Mission on a range of issues and I 
will value the institutional knowledge that career Foreign Service 
officers provide.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Yes, I believe it is important to provide employees with 
accurate, constructive feedback on their performance to encourage 
improvement and reward those who most succeed in their roles. If 
confirmed, I hope to be an inspiring leader with an open-door policy to 
discuss constructive and timely feedback to enhance and lift the 
performance of the entire team.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I would support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees to improve performance and 
reward high achievers.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Iceland.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. I firmly believe it is imperative that U.S. diplomats get 
outside of the Embassy to meet with local citizens, including host 
government officials and non-governmental organizations. The COVID-19 
pandemic has been a challenge for U.S. diplomats to travel and fully 
engage face-to-face with host country nationals, but as conditions 
improve, I understand that U.S. diplomats have resumed in-person 
engagements and programs again, as appropriate.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to working closely with the 
Embassy public diplomacy section to use both social and traditional 
media to reach people across Iceland. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
accessibility are also an important part of public diplomacy outreach 
to ensure efforts reflect the diversity of U.S. society and societies 
abroad and encourage the involvement of people from traditionally 
underrepresented audiences. If confirmed, I will work with the Embassy 
team to leverage engagements with the media, cultural and educational 
exchange organizations, and individual interactions to expand the 
people-to-people bonds that are the foundation of our strong bilateral 
relationship.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in the 
Iceland?

    Answer. The United States has strong academic, cultural, and 
professional exchanges with the people of Iceland. As I understand it, 
many government leaders are alumni of U.S. exchange programs with 
Iceland. If confirmed, I will work with the Embassy team to leverage 
relationships with the media, cultural and educational exchange 
organizations, and individuals to expand the people-to-people bonds 
that are the foundation of our strong bilateral relationship.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge for U.S. 
diplomats to travel and fully engage face-to-face with host country 
nationals. As conditions improve, U.S. diplomats have started in-person 
engagements and programs again. If confirmed, I look forward to 
utilizing both traditional and social media to engage with the 
Icelandic public, in addition to in-person programs.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. We are all one team working to advance the bilateral 
relationship and the interests of the United States and the American 
people and if confirmed, I look forward to working with the offices at 
Main State to advance U.S. foreign policy goals in Iceland. If 
confirmed, I will leverage public diplomacy tools to enhance security 
cooperation, strengthen collaboration on Arctic and climate issues, 
expand economic and trade relations, defend democratic values, and 
deepen people-to-people ties. I will work to counter adverse influence 
and mis- and disinformation through engagements with traditional media, 
communication via social media, institutional outreach, and personal 
interactions, and through a variety of public diplomacy programming. 
Working with the public diplomacy team, we will tailor our messaging in 
a way that is most appropriate for Icelandic audiences.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome.'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, there is nothing I will take more 
seriously than the health and security of the people who will be 
working with me.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Reykjavik personnel?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I commit to sharing what information I 
can within the bounds of privacy and security concerns with Mission 
Reykjavik personnel.

                    follow-up questions submitted to
                   carrin f. patman by senator risch
            Bilateral Defense Relationship/Arctic
          Question. The Arctic is becoming increasingly important to 
        global security. Russia and China have both stated interest in 
        the region, and through its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has 
        shown a new willingness to use its military to achieve its 
        geostrategic goals.

     If confirmed, how will you work to strengthen the U.S.-Icelandic 
            security relationship, both bilaterally and with a mind to 
            our mutual security relationships with the other Arctic 
            nations?

          Answer. Iceland considers its membership in NATO and its 
        defense agreement with the United States as the two main 
        pillars of its security policy. I understand that the United 
        States plans to maintain its presence on a rotational basis to 
        support its obligations to NATO and Iceland. The United States 
        works closely with the Government of Iceland on NATO and U.S. 
        activities, and U.S. military forces have received great 
        support at Keflavik Air Base in Iceland. This invaluable 
        cooperation is crucial to the defense of Iceland and the 
        broader North Atlantic region, especially given increased 
        tensions in the region. If confirmed, I will work to maintain 
        Icelandic contributions to transatlantic security and the 
        broader North Atlantic region, which is directly in the 
        interest of the United States and our Allies and partners.

          Question. How will you work to counter Russian or Chinese 
        influence that may seek to undermine the United States' Arctic 
        interests in Iceland?

          Answer. Iceland seeks to maintain commitment to the rules-
        based international order and low tensions in the High North 
        and works with other NATO Allies to ensure the Alliance has a 
        credible deterrence and defense posture in the region. Iceland, 
        together with the United States and other likeminded Arctic 
        States, immediately and strongly condemned Putin's 
        premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war in Ukraine. I 
        understand that Iceland is keenly aware of Russia's increased 
        military activities in the Arctic. Iceland is also taking 
        concrete steps to protect its critical infrastructure including 
        through the recent passage of a telecommunications law. If 
        confirmed, I will work with the Icelandic Government to ensure 
        Iceland and NATO's continued attention to security challenges 
        in the High North and share best practices on reducing 
        vulnerabilities and protecting critical infrastructure. 
        Further, if confirmed, I look forward to consulting with 
        Congress and the Department of Defense and the Department of 
        Treasury on this issue.

          Question. Do you believe that Finland and Sweden's accession 
        to NATO will fundamentally change the security environment in 
        the Arctic? If so, please explain how?

          Answer. The accession of Finland and Sweden would introduce 
        two new, highly capable Allies with deep Arctic expertise into 
        the Alliance. I believe this will contribute to greater 
        predictability and stability in the region. Iceland is a 
        founding member of NATO and has strongly welcomed Finland and 
        Sweden's decisions to apply for NATO membership. Iceland was 
        among the first group of countries to ratify Finland and 
        Sweden's applications. Page Break

            Nuclear
          Question. Public support for the Treaty of the Prohibition of 
        Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) in Iceland is high.

     If confirmed, how will you engage with the Icelandic Government 
            to express the importance NATO's nuclear arsenal holds in 
            our collective defense and how joining the TPNW could 
            undermine our nuclear security?

          Answer. As a member of the NATO Alliance, Iceland has 
        committed to ensuring that NATO's nuclear deterrent aligns with 
        the realities of the current security environment and remains 
        safe, secure, and effective. If confirmed, I will regularly 
        engage with the Icelandic Government on tangible, verifiable 
        measures to reduce strategic risk and enable progress on 
        nuclear disarmament.

          Question. While Iceland is a member of NATO, it has refused 
        to store nuclear weapons within its territory.

     Given a paradigm shift in the NATO's security with regard to 
            renewed Russian aggression, do you believe the conversation 
            about nuclear weapons in Iceland should be revisited, and 
            that the U.S. should have a role in that conversation?

          Answer. Iceland has a longstanding policy against nuclear 
        weapons on Icelandic territory. However, as a member of the 
        NATO Alliance, Iceland is committed to ensuring NATO's nuclear 
        deterrent remains safe, secure, and effective. Nuclear weapons 
        are a core component of NATO's overall capabilities for 
        deterrence and defense and are the supreme guarantee of the 
        security of the Alliance. If confirmed, I look forward to 
        working closely with Iceland to maintain nuclear deterrence.

            Economic Relations
          Question. If confirmed, how will you work with the Government 
        and private sector of Iceland to increase and improve economic 
        ties with the United States?

          Answer. The United States enjoys an active trade and 
        investment partnership with Iceland and is Iceland's largest 
        trading partner. The United States and Iceland signed a Trade 
        and Investment Framework Agreement in 2009. If confirmed, I 
        will continue our promotion of U.S. exports to Iceland and 
        encourage Icelandic investment in U.S. companies by engaging 
        regularly with both the Government and the private sector in 
        Iceland.

          Question. In what sectors do you believe exist the best 
        opportunities for increased U.S.-Iceland trade?

          Answer. Key U.S. exports to Iceland include fuels and 
        lubricants, food and beverages, capital goods, and 
        transportation equipment. Key U.S. imports from Iceland include 
        fish and fish products, orthopedic equipment, and food and 
        beverages. The United States has an important opportunity to 
        work with Iceland in deploying innovative green technologies 
        that can help in our shared fight against climate change. 
        Iceland has been a leader in developing green technologies and 
        if confirmed, I look forward to continuing our cooperation in 
        this important field, including commercial opportunities for 
        U.S. firms.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
          Submitted to Carrin F. Patman by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has sought to expand 
its influence in Iceland and offered to develop a deep-sea port to gain 
a larger footing in the Artic and North Atlantic, all while the U.S. 
provides military defense for Iceland through NATO.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. The President has made it clear the United States views the 
People's Republic of China (PRC) as a strategic competitor that 
challenges the existing rules-based international order. As Secretary 
Blinken said on May 26, we will invest in America, align with our 
Allies, and compete with the PRC to defend our interests and build our 
vision for the future. If confirmed, I will strengthen our partnership 
with Iceland, including working with Iceland to implement investment 
screening mechanisms to protect ports and other critical 
infrastructure.

    Question. How does Iceland view Moscow's and Beijing's activities 
in the Arctic?

    Answer. Iceland seeks to maintain commitment to the rules-based 
international order and low tensions in the High North and works with 
other NATO Allies to ensure the Alliance has a credible deterrence and 
defense posture in the region. Iceland, together with the United States 
and other likeminded Arctic States, immediately and strongly condemned 
Putin's premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war in Ukraine. I 
understand that Iceland is keenly aware of Russia's increased military 
activities in the Arctic. Climate change has increased strategic 
competition in the Arctic region. Melting sea ice has created new 
opportunities for the PRC and Russia to exploit the region--both 
economically and militarily. Iceland is taking proactive steps to 
protect its critical infrastructure, including by passing a recent 
telecommunications bill to establish a new legal framework governing a 
broad range of telecommunications issues, including national security. 
At the NATO Summit in June 2021, all thirty Allies agreed to a Summit 
Communique that referenced the High North for the first time, 
demonstrating a commitment to bolstering NATO's deterrence and defense 
in the region. NATO's new Strategic Concept reaffirms this commitment. 
If confirmed, I will work with the Icelandic Government to ensure 
Iceland and NATO's continued attention to security challenges in the 
High North. Further, if confirmed, I look forward to consulting with 
Congress and the Department of Defense on this issue.

    Question. Since the 1951 signing of the U.S.-Iceland Defense 
Agreement, Iceland has no armed forces and the United States, on behalf 
of NATO, is responsible for its defense. In return, the U.S. military 
possesses basing rights in Iceland, which it has not used since 2006. 
In 2016, the United States and Iceland agreed on a new joint defense 
declaration aimed at bolstering security cooperation, and the United 
States has been upgrading its facilities at Iceland's Keflavik military 
base. Should the 1951 Treaty be revised so Iceland can build up its own 
capabilities and contribute to NATO's collective defense? Why or why 
not?

    Answer. Iceland is the only NATO ally without a standing military; 
however, even without a military it provides invaluable contributions 
to NATO's collective defense and transatlantic security. Iceland 
provides 24/7 air surveillance through its four remote radar and 
communication sites and hosts NATO Air Policing Missions, helping to 
maintain NATO's crucial readiness in the Arctic and North Atlantic. 
Furthermore, the United States and Iceland consult and cooperate 
regularly on defense-related matters, including through an annual 
Strategic Dialogue, regular consultations with U.S. European Command 
(USEUCOM), and various joint exercises. I understand that under the 
auspices of the annual Strategic Dialogue, security-related issues can 
be discussed in a mutually beneficial manner, so while I cannot speak 
to hypotheticals regarding the 1951 Treaty, the United States and 
Iceland maintain an open dialogue on these issues. If confirmed, I will 
work to maintain Icelandic contributions to transatlantic security, 
which is directly in the interest of the United States and our Allies 
and partners.

    Question. In what ways are such measures contributing to the 
defense of Iceland and the broader North Atlantic region, especially 
given increased tensions between Russia, the West, and countering CCP 
aspirations in the region?

    Answer. Iceland lies in a key geostrategic location in the 
Greenland-Iceland-UK (GIUK) Gap, and due to climate change opening 
maritime routes through the Arctic, the North Atlantic is becoming more 
critical in the realm of defense and security. The U.S. Department of 
Defense maintains a rotational presence at Keflavik Air Base in Iceland 
to support theater and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and maritime domain 
awareness. The U.S. Navy deploys P-8A aircraft and crews to Iceland to 
support the ASW mission. Icelandic Coast Guard personnel also maintain 
a central hub for the four radar stations around Iceland that provide 
data to NATO and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), 
providing a complete listing of all aircraft in the North Atlantic to 
NATO and NORAD. This invaluable cooperation is crucial to the defense 
of Iceland and the broader North Atlantic region, especially given 
increased tensions in the region. If confirmed, I will work to maintain 
Icelandic contributions to transatlantic security and the broader North 
Atlantic region, which is directly in the interest of the United States 
and our Allies and partners.

    Question. Would Iceland welcome the U.S. deploying forces to 
Iceland to help deter Chinese and Russian military activity in the 
Arctic?

    Answer. While I cannot speak to hypotheticals or on behalf of the 
Icelandic Government, I understand that Iceland considers its 
membership in NATO and the defense agreement with the United States as 
the two main pillars of its security policy. I understand that the 
United States plans to maintain its presence on a rotational basis to 
support its obligations to NATO and Iceland. The United States works 
closely with the Government of Iceland on NATO and U.S. activities, and 
U.S. military forces have received great support at Keflavik Air Base 
in Iceland. If confirmed, I look forward to continuing this close 
cooperation.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
      Submitted to Angela Price Aggeler by Senator James E. Risch

Democracy and Human Rights
    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Human Rights report, North 
Macedonia is noted for inhuman and degrading conditions in prisons, 
violence and threats against journalists, serious government 
corruption, lack of accountability for gender based and family 
violence, and more.

   How could you work with the North Macedonian government to address 
        issues of government corruption?

    Answer. The United States recognizes and welcomes the steps the 
current government has taken to fight corruption and impunity. There is 
more work to be done, and anyone that has abused the public's trust 
must be held to account no matter his or her party, background, or 
position. If confirmed, I will continue to urge the government of North 
Macedonia to hold its officials accountable, to thoroughly investigate 
allegations of abuse of office, and to address corruption swiftly and 
thoroughly. I will work to strengthen state institutions and bolster 
public confidence in the government and the rule of law.

    Question. If confirmed, what steps would you take with the host 
government to mitigate the levels of violence or threats of violence 
against journalists, and increase the accountability of family and 
gender based violence?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will promote the values of freedom, 
democracy, individual liberty, and human dignity. U.S. assistance 
includes grants to local groups that promote the protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of members of vulnerable or targeted 
populations, including members of minority groups and journalists. If 
confirmed, I will reinforce the importance of a free media with North 
Macedonia's political leaders and public and will speak out publicly 
and privately in defense of targeted journalists and media 
organizations.. A free and independent media is critical for any 
democratic society. I would also work with the Ministry of Justice to 
increase accountability for acts of violence against journalists and 
gender-based violence.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to personally raising these 
issues with the host government?

    Answer. Absolutely. The U.S. closely follows the state of North 
Macedonia's democratic institutions and rule of law, as we do with all 
countries. If confirmed, I will continue to work with North Macedonia 
to uphold transatlantic values, including personally raising the issues 
of violence against journalists and gender-based violence with the 
government.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons 
report, North Macedonia remained a Tier 2 country for not fully meeting 
the standards for the elimination of trafficking but maintaining 
significant efforts to do so. However, the police maintain a lack of 
funding and equipment to conduct proactive investigations, and local 
teams and border security lack the ability to properly screen for 
trafficking indicators.

   If confirmed, how could you work with the host government to 
        increase the funding provided to properly conduct proactive 
        trafficking investigations?

    Answer. The Embassy maintains close relationships with anti-
trafficking civil society groups and actively engages the government of 
North Macedonia to address priority recommendations highlighted in the 
2022 TIP Report, including investigating, prosecuting, and convicting 
traffickers--including complicit officials--imposing adequate 
penalties, and allocating sufficient resources to this important work. 
If confirmed, I will encourage the government of North Macedonia to 
increase assistance for victims, particularly among vulnerable groups, 
and to allocate consistent and sufficient funding for victim services 
and investigations.

    Question. What steps could you take to improve the level of 
training to better identify trafficking indicators?

    Answer. The United States supports the government of North 
Macedonia's work with international humanitarian organizations and has 
contributed border security equipment and training for anti-trafficking 
officials. If confirmed, I will continue to encourage the government to 
seek additional training opportunities for its officials and to work 
closely with the United States as well as non-governmental 
organizations to better identify trafficking indicators. I would also 
work with the interagency to identify opportunities for American 
experts to engage, train, and mentor the government on anti-trafficking 
work, border security, resilience, information sharing, and prosecution 
of traffickers.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, North Macedonia's constitution prohibits religious 
discrimination and provides for freedom of religion and expression. 
However, some members of religious communities such as the Orthodox 
Archbishopric of Ohrid say their clergy and family members are targets 
of insult and physical attack by individuals close to the Macedonian 
Orthodox Church--Ohrid Archbishopric, which is considered to be a 
governmental favorite of religious organizations.

   What is your assessment of the level of religious tolerance in the 
        country?

    Answer. North Macedonia's constitution guarantees equal rights for 
all citizens regardless of national origin, and the country has an 
active, independent ombudsman to protect human rights and freedoms of 
individuals and groups of citizens. Smaller religious groups report 
unequal government treatment compared with the five religious groups 
named in the constitution, which automatically receive tax exemptions 
and other benefits. Several communities have expressed concerns about 
the religious property restitution process.

    Question. If confirmed, how could you work with the host government 
to address these concerns?

    Answer. The Embassy in Skopje regularly meets with religious groups 
and government representatives to discuss religious freedom issues, 
including perceived government favoritism toward certain religious 
groups and religious property restitution. If confirmed, I would 
continue vigorous outreach efforts and work with the government to 
address such concerns.

International Organizations
    Question. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the UN, including in elections for 
specialized bodies like the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who if 
elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. 
She is in a tough race that will require early, consistent engagement 
across capitals and within the U.N. member states.

   If confirmed, do you commit to demarching the North Macedonian 
        government and any other counterparts necessary to encourage 
        their support of Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. Yes. I would continue to engage the Government of North 
Macedonia to encourage support for American candidates at the UN, 
including Doreen Bogdan-Martin who is seeking election as Secretary-
General of the ITU. This is an important election for leadership of a 
U.N. agency that plays a critical role in technology and digital 
policy, cybersecurity, internet governance, radio spectrum management, 
telecommunication standards, and critical development initiatives to 
close the digital divides.

    Question. If confirmed, how can you work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify, recruit, 
and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior Program 
Officer (JPO) program at the UN?

    Answer. Embassy Skopje has a vibrant public affairs section. If 
confirmed, I will work with IO, but also through public-facing Embassy 
outreach, to identify and recruit qualified Americans to the UN, 
including for the JPO Program. I would maintain close communication 
with Washington to identify upcoming opportunities and amplify these 
through Embassy channels.

Europe and Eurasia
    Question. North Macedonia has a high rate of voting coincidence 
with the U.S. in the U.N. General Assembly and in the Security Council.

   If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to engage with 
        North Macedonians on anticipated votes in the U.N. system that 
        would continue to build upon this record with the U.S.?

    Answer. The Embassy regularly engages the government in Skopje on 
important issues, including but not limited to votes in the U.N. 
system. If confirmed, I would uphold this practice and pursue open and 
transparent conversations on our voting posture and its import for 
democracy, security, economic growth, and human rights around the 
world. Page Break

State Department Management and Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Skopje?

    Answer. The American and local employees at Embassy Skopje have 
dealt with significant challenges posed by COVID-19. I am grateful for 
their tremendous service in overcoming these challenges. If confirmed, 
the health and safety of the personnel and family members of Embassy 
Skopje will be my first priority. I will prioritize meeting with and 
supporting Embassy employees to understand and mitigate the impact of 
the pandemic on the mission. I look forward to working with the 
incredibly talented team of locally employed staff, U.S. Direct Hires, 
and their families, and to ensuring that everyone on my team 
understands they are valued and have my support.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Skopje?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with my Deputy Chief of Mission 
and senior staff to foster an atmosphere in which all employees know 
that they can bring serious issues to us and are being heard at the 
highest levels. If confirmed, I will work to ensure everyone on my 
team, including our ethnically diverse local staff, is treated 
professionally, their rights are respected, and they are safe and 
secure. I will conduct personal outreach to Embassy staff when I 
arrive. If confirmed, I will promote training and professional 
development, and work to ensure that all staff members are aware of the 
employee and family support resources that the Department offers to 
assist employees.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Skopje?

    Answer. Having served as Charge d'Affaires of Mission Pakistan for 
two years, I understand the imperative of a unified team with a shared 
strategic vision to meeting policy priorities. If confirmed, I will 
foster a strong team with a clear understanding of our goals and 
objectives; maintain clear and transparent communications throughout 
the Mission through regular information sharing; promote diversity and 
inclusion; seek ways to build and sustain morale; and support and 
ensure the safety and community of the Mission community--including 
both American and local staff. I will treat the team with the respect 
and professionalism they deserve and work to provide them the tools 
they need to do their jobs. We are all one team, working together to 
advance U.S. policy goals and the U.S.-North Macedonia relationship, in 
the interests of the American people; I will ensure this collaborative 
service focus is central to our work.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I value respect, professionalism, open communication, and 
creative thinking. I welcome divergent points of view. I strive to 
provide clear decisions and guidance as needed. I am committed to 
fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce that fully represents and 
supports many different cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives to 
provide a productive and effective workplace for all that advances U.S. 
policy goals.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No, never. Berating subordinates is offensive, 
counterproductive, and unacceptable. If confirmed, I will treat all my 
employees with the utmost respect and professionalism that each one 
deserves.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work to build a relationship of mutual 
trust and respect with the Deputy Chief of Mission, delegating when 
appropriate and ensuring he or she can step in for me in the event I am 
not available.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. I see the role of the Deputy Chief of Mission as both a 
chief operating officer and the alter-ego of the ambassador. If 
confirmed and after I arrive at post, I will work out with the Deputy 
Chief of Mission which responsibilities rest with whom.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Yes. Candid, constructive, and comprehensive performance 
reviews are essential for employees to know where they stand and 
understand where they need to improve. In between formal annual 
reviews, it is also important for supervisors to clearly communicate 
what expectations are and to provide regular feedback to employees on 
meeting these goals.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Absolutely. Ensuring clear, accurate, and direct feedback 
will help improve mission performance, and I will recognize the 
accomplishments of high-performing employees as deserved.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
North Macedonia. In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our 
embassy walls enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. In my time as Charge at the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan, I 
encouraged our diplomats to engage as security situations allowed. If 
confirmed, I hope to exchange ideas with people from all parts of North 
Macedonia's society to hear their views, promote our shared goals, and 
expand the people-to-people bonds that are the foundation of our strong 
bilateral partnership. I will encourage colleagues and official 
visitors to do the same.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will ensure that the U.S. diplomats under 
my authority can travel and meet the people they need to accomplish 
their jobs. My understanding is that in North Macedonia this has not 
been an issue.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in North 
Macedonia?

    Answer. Embassy Skopje's Public Diplomacy Section uses the full 
array of public diplomacy tools to engage with citizens of North 
Macedonia across all facets of society, including media engagement; the 
U.S. Speaker Program; English language instruction; educational and 
professional exchanges; alumni outreach; cultural and sports diplomacy 
programs; grants to local non-governmental organizations (NGOs); and 
educational advising.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. Disinformation, malign foreign influence, and the COVID-19 
pandemic pose challenges to public diplomacy outreach in North 
Macedonia, as it has globally. If confirmed, I look forward to using 
traditional and social media, in addition to in-person programs, to 
engage with the public in North Macedonia and push back on 
disinformation from malign actors and a shrinking space for independent 
media.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the Public Diplomacy Section 
to closely coordinate the efforts of public diplomacy professionals in 
both Washington and Skopje to ensure that there is a unified approach 
to highlighting key U.S. messages and policies in North Macedonia. I 
will leverage public diplomacy tools to engage on a variety of 
different social media platforms in English, Macedonian, and Albanian 
to deliver tailored messages on U.S. foreign policy; promote Embassy 
activities and events; provide information on security, economy, 
voting, and other topics of interest to U.S. citizens; and communicate 
with the public in North Macedonia in an impactful way that advances 
U.S. priorities out of Washington.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Absolutely. The issue of Anomalous Health Incidents--
including the interagency effort to protect and care for our personnel 
and uncover the cause of these incidents--is an absolute priority for 
the Department. AHIs have been a top priority for Secretary Blinken, 
who set clear goals for the Health Incident Response Task Force to 
strengthen the Department's communication with the workforce, provide 
care for affected employees and family members, and better protect 
against these events in the future as we work to uncover the cause. I 
have no higher priority than the safety of the members of my embassy 
team and their families.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Skopje personnel?

    Answer. Absolutely. I believe open and transparent communication is 
critical for a workplace to function well, and leadership should set 
the example for that within the bounds of privacy and security 
concerns.

Europe and Eurasia
    Question. If confirmed to be Ambassador, how will you work with the 
Government of North Macedonia on key domestic issues like legal reform 
and education as they move toward EU accession?

    Answer. For 18 years, the United States has supported North 
Macedonia as it has worked to achieve the democratic and economic 
reforms necessary to join the European Union. The EU has been clear 
that in addition to making required legal changes, it expects strong 
implementation of reforms across the board. U.S. Government programs 
focus on helping to create and sustain an enabling environment for the 
Government of North Macedonia to address EU recommendations. The State 
Department also focuses on improving basic competencies and the 
efficiency, transparency, and accountability of justice sector and law 
enforcement institutions, in line with North Macedonia's goals of 
integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions. If confirmed, I will 
continue to advocate for reforms and their full implementation.

    Question. Should the U.S. play a role in helping negotiate North 
Macedonia's prospective EU membership with its neighbors? How can the 
U.S. contribute to regional stability?

    Answer. Although not a member state, the United States continues to 
strongly support the EU accession process and related reforms for all 
Western Balkan countries, which will contribute to the long-term 
stability and prosperity of the region. As part of this, we are 
supporting continued, constructive dialogue between North Macedonia, EU 
institutions, and EU member states, including Bulgaria. If confirmed, I 
would urge flexibility and cooperation by both Skopje and Sofia as they 
work on resolving their bilateral issues. The United States contributes 
further to regional stability through its support for robust and 
inclusive regional initiatives based on EU rules and regulations, such 
as Open Balkan and Common Regional Market. Initiatives like these are 
energizing Western Balkan economies, moving the region closer to the EU 
single market, and promoting peace and stability through implementation 
of the EU Four Freedoms: goods, capital, services, and people.

    Question. 100 percent of North Macedonia's natural gas imports come 
from Russia. What vulnerabilities does this monopoly place on North 
Macedonia, and how can the U.S. help reduce them?

    Answer. North Macedonia has been hit hard by the energy crisis in 
Europe this spring. For example, the city of Skopje relies on Russian 
natural gas to power the central heating system, and Gazprom took 
advantage of its monopoly to quadruple its prices last winter. 
Additionally, energy prices have risen by 10-20 percent since the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine, leading the Government to temporarily 
reduce value-added tax (VAT) and excise duties on fuels to lessen the 
hardship on citizens. We are encouraging diversification of energy 
sources to address these vulnerabilities. North Macedonia is determined 
to move forward on a gas interconnector with Greece, currently awaiting 
final loan financing, which would diversify North Macedonia's supply, 
introduce competition, and potentially open the market to U.S. LNG 
suppliers. The Government's focus on renewable energy sources also 
brings opportunities for U.S. investment.

    Question. How will you work with North Macedonia's Government and 
private sector to increase economic ties with the United States?

    Answer. North Macedonia's legal framework for foreign investors is 
generally in line with international standards. U.S. Embassy Skopje 
works to defend the rights of U.S. exporters, suppliers, and investors 
doing business in North Macedonia, including protecting intellectual 
property rights and identifying and addressing trade barriers that 
interfere with the growth of U.S. exports, including agriculture 
commodities. If confirmed, I will continue to support American 
companies exploring opportunities in North Macedonia; protect the 
rights of U.S. exporters, suppliers, and investors; and identify and 
work with the Government to address trade barriers that interfere with 
U.S. exports.

    Question. As Ambassador, how will you work to build people-to-
people ties between the U.S. and North Macedonia, particularly to 
counter Russian influence?

    Answer. During June's bilateral strategic dialogue in Washington, 
DC, North Macedonia's Minister of Culture Stojcevska identified 
protection of cultural heritage and youth engagement as her Ministry's 
top two priorities for bilateral people-to-people engagement. People-
to-people relationships are essential to strengthening cooperation on 
global challenges, especially with respect to disinformation and 
foreign malign influence. Between 2018 and 2022, five Fulbright English 
Teaching Assistants received ``Countering State Disinformation and 
Pressure'' funding from Congress and are promoting media literacy and 
critical thinking in schools and universities throughout North 
Macedonia. If confirmed, I will focus on raising media standards, 
bolstering public education about disinformation, especially among 
youth, and encouraging capacity-building to improve the Government of 
North Macedonia's communications capabilities.
    If confirmed, I would also continue efforts to deter illicit 
trafficking of antiquities and encourage bilateral cultural, 
scientific, and educational exchanges, and work to preserve North 
Macedonia's cultural heritage, including through the U.S. Ambassadors 
Fund for Cultural Preservation.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you promote democratic and anti-
corruption reforms in North Macedonia, and in what areas of government 
is progress most viable?

    Answer. The U.S. recognizes and welcomes the steps the current 
government has taken to fight corruption and impunity. There is more 
work to be done. Anyone that has abused the public's trust must be held 
to account, no matter his or her party, background, or position. If 
confirmed, I will urge North Macedonia's Government to hold officials 
accountable, thoroughly investigate allegations of abuse of office, and 
combat corruption vigorously, to strengthen government institutions and 
bolster public confidence in the Government and the rule of law. The 
current government is making strides on good governance reforms. In 
January 2021, it appointed a new Deputy Prime Minister for Good 
Governance Policies to focus on structural and procedural reforms that 
reduce opportunities for corruption.

    Question. North Macedonia is very reliant upon energy imports, 
including Russian natural gas. They have been very supportive of U.S. 
and NATO responses to Russia's war in Ukraine, but have been added to a 
list of Moscow's ``enemy states.''

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. The President has made it clear the United States views the 
People's Republic of China (PRC) as a strategic competitor that 
challenges the existing rules-based international order. The Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP) presents itself in the Western Balkan region as 
an alternative to EU financing and other international financial and 
development organizations. It is a threat not only to solid economic 
and democratic practices and international standards, but also to U.S. 
companies seeking fair entry into the market. If confirmed, I would 
bolster U.S. ability to respond to the economic and political threats 
the CCP and other malign actors pose in the region.

    Question. North Macedonia does not currently meet the 2 percent GDP 
goal but is heading in the right direction. What will you do to press 
North Macedonia to meet the 2 percent requirement and sustain it over 
time?

    Answer. As NATO's newest ally, North Macedonia has been responsive 
and is implementing its plan to reach 2 percent by 2024. The country 
intends to spend more than $750 million through 2028 toward military 
modernization to meet its NATO capability target requirements and 
actively seeks U.S. assistance and training. If confirmed, I will 
champion strong military to military cooperation to help North 
Macedonia to meet its 2 percent commitment.

    Question. How has Putin's war on Ukraine impacted North Macedonia's 
energy security and economy?

    Answer. The Balkans energy sector has long been plagued by chronic 
underinvestment, over-dependence on Russian supply, structural 
weaknesses, heavy subsidization of coal and electricity, and 
inefficient market mechanisms. Putin's war against Ukraine has 
exacerbated North Macedonia's energy security and economic challenges, 
including food security. North Macedonia already faced inflation in 
energy costs. The Government's clear alignment with EU sanctions 
packages led Russia to label North Macedonia an ``unfriendly state,'' 
and this spring Moscow shut off supply to Bulgaria--through which North 
Macedonia receive its gas--further elevating gas prices. The Government 
expects key commodity and energy prices to continue rising and 
investments to be delayed.

    Question. In what ways can the United States support 
diversification of their energy imports?

    Answer. North Macedonia needs to further diversify its energy 
sources and routes; develop competitive, transparent, and efficient 
energy markets; and better integrate its domestic energy market with 
regional energy markets. North Macedonia currently relies on one 
pipeline for its limited quantities of natural gas, which come from 
Russia. A proposed gas interconnector connecting North Macedonia with 
Greece could help diversify gas routes and supplies and allow 
gasification of other parts of the country. In the long term, the 
proposed interconnector could also provide alternatives to Kosovo and 
Serbia and help turn North Macedonia into a regional energy hub. If 
confirmed, I will work to facilitate private sector participation in 
renewable energy policymaking and encourage U.S. companies to bid on 
renewable energy projects.

    Question. Would this include construction of the proposed East 
Mediterranean Pipeline?

    Answer. Energy sector diversification in this heavily coal-reliant 
region will require more rapid implementation of renewable and clean 
energy technologies and the optimized application of lower-carbon fuel 
alternatives, including potential natural gas applications. If 
confirmed, I would work to help North Macedonia diversify away from 
Russian gas and support economically viable projects that connect North 
Macedonia with non-Russian energy supplies.

    Question. To what extent does the Chinese Communist Party wield 
economic or political influence in North Macedonia?

    Answer. The PRC presents itself in the Western Balkan region as an 
alternative to EU financing and other international financial and 
development organizations. In North Macedonia, PRC investments are 
primarily focused on road construction and other infrastructure 
projects. Two major PRC road construction projects are currently 
underway, funded by the PRC's ExIm Bank. Not surprisingly, the largest 
of these projects has been plagued by delays, design flaws, quality 
control problems, and additional expenses. This, along with 
disappointing results from procurement contracts for city buses, rail 
cars, and computers for school children, have made the Government 
appropriately wary of pursuing future PRC contracts. If confirmed, I 
would work with the current government to raise awareness of the risks 
associated with such projects and encourage other private and 
government financing options.

    Question. As Ambassador, how would you help North Macedonia build 
resilience to external authoritarian influence?

    Answer. Our goals align with the aspirations of the people of North 
Macedonia and their Government for a stable, prosperous, and democratic 
future. External authoritarian elements actively seek to undermine the 
democratic and Euro-Atlantic integration aspirations of the country, by 
stoking tensions, spreading disinformation, and sowing corruption. If 
confirmed, I would champion strong, democratic institutions, a vibrant 
and independent media environment, and work to crack down on external 
influences seeking to corrupt government actors. Embassy Skopje is also 
pressing the Government to create a national security investment 
screening mechanism to protect key assets from malign external 
influence. If confirmed, I would press forward ongoing technical 
consultations to see that these measures are put in place.

Europe and Eurasia
    Question. If confirmed, how will you work with the Slovakian 
Government to navigate the impending European energy crisis? What 
elements of this impending crisis concern you most vis-a-vis Slovakia?

    Answer. Obstacles to greater Slovak energy independence include 
geography, a legacy of dependence on cheap Russian energy and 
associated infrastructure, and a need to increase and accelerate 
programs to enhance renewable energy sources. To their credit, the 
Slovak leadership has the high-level political will to take difficult 
decisions to advance energy security. The United States is committed to 
advancing European energy security through an integrated European 
energy market and through diversification--of fuel types, supply source 
countries, and delivery routes. We continue to encourage Slovakia to 
work within EU structures to promote greater integration within the 
EU's own internal energy market. If confirmed, I will work with my 
counterparts across the region to promote this type of regional 
collaboration. My intent would be to urge the Slovak Government to 
remain on its pathway to energy diversification, prioritizing reliable 
and politically stable partners across fuel types.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you work with the Government of 
Slovakia to continue to coordinate and implement sanctions on Russia? 
How will you work with the Government of Slovakia to help them foil 
attempts at evasion of U.S. and EU sanctions on Russia?

    Answer. Following Russia's unprovoked further invasion of Ukraine 
in February 2022, Slovakia's government has been unequivocal in 
condemning the Russian Federation and supporting U.S. and EU sanctions 
against it. Slovakia also significantly reduced the size of the Russian 
embassy in Bratislava by imposing a cap on the number of Russians with 
diplomatic status allowed in the country. I understand that Slovakia's 
leaders have strongly advocated for the implementation and coordination 
of strong sanctions on Russia. If confirmed, I will work with the 
Slovak government to diminish Russia's capacity to foil U.S. and EU 
sanctions, including through the sharing of U.S. knowhow.

    Question. Slovakia has been a significant provider of military aid 
to Ukraine. If confirmed, how will you ensure Slovakia receives proper 
support from the U.S., most particularly on the question of assistance 
to backfill the equipment they donated to Ukraine?

    Answer. I understand that, to date, the Slovak government has 
provided more than ?159 million in both humanitarian and military aid 
to Ukraine, including its S-300 air defense system, valued by the 
government at ?68 million. Slovakia remains one of the largest donors 
to Ukraine measured by aid as a share of GDP. Russia's unprovoked, 
full-scale invasion of Ukraine has stretched Slovakia's resources, as 
it has the resources of many countries in the region. Slovakia would 
benefit from U.S. assistance, above all to support Foreign Military 
Financing. Assistance would also be useful to address disinformation, 
bolster civil society, and fight corruption. If confirmed as 
Ambassador, I would advocate for appropriate U.S. support for Slovakia, 
and I will ensure that any U.S. assistance is impactful and spent well.

    Question. Slovakia has housed over 85,000 Ukrainian refugees since 
the Russian invasion in February. If confirmed, how will you assist the 
Slovakia government in their efforts provide for these refugees and 
their security?

    Answer. Following Russia's February 2022 further invasion of 
Ukraine, I understand that Slovakia was among the first EU member 
states to create a temporary protective status for Ukrainian refugees, 
providing them immediate access to critical services, support, and the 
right to work in Slovakia. The outpouring of support by Slovaks for 
their Ukrainian neighbors has been inspiring. Slovaks have opened their 
hearts and their homes to Ukrainians. Through the State Department's 
Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, the United States has 
provided nearly $22 million to international humanitarian organizations 
in Slovakia supporting refugees from Ukraine. If confirmed as 
Ambassador, I will continue to prioritize these and other avenues of 
support and ensure that any U.S. assistance is impactful and spent 
well.

    Question. How will you work with Slovakia's government and private 
sector to increase economic ties with the United States?

    Answer. Slovakia presents significant opportunities for U.S. 
business, such as suppliers in the automotive parts industry. Slovakia 
is also focusing on supporting innovative small and medium-sized 
enterprises that are an attractive segment for U.S. investors, 
especially venture capitalists, private equity, and pension funds. If 
confirmed, I will work closely with the U.S. Department of Commerce to 
ensure that the full resources of the U.S. Government are used to 
advocate for U.S. businesses exporting to Slovakia and promote 
opportunities for Slovak firms seeking to invest in the United States. 
I will also partner with the local American Chamber of Commerce, if 
confirmed, to keep a pulse on the health of Slovakia's business 
climate, with a focus on continuing to improve transparency, 
predictability, stability, and the transfer of best practices from the 
United States.

    Question. As Ambassador, how will you work to build people-to-
people ties between the U.S. and Slovakia?

    Answer. I understand that one of the Embassy's key goals is 
expanding people-to-people ties in order to build support for shared 
values and reinforce Slovakia's commitment to the West and our common 
transatlantic goals. If confirmed, I will prioritize sending Embassy 
and visiting speakers out to engage Slovak audiences on the full range 
of Mission priorities, and by organizing regular, creative public 
outreach engagements designed for a variety of audiences that allow us 
to engage with a wide range of Slovaks across the country. The Embassy 
is working to strengthen education in Slovakia through its small grants 
program and by providing support to English-language teachers. The 
Embassy has given small grants to support a variety of initiatives that 
help build critical thinking skills, support the integration of 
minorities, and encourage the greater participation of girls in 
science, technology, engineering and math. The Embassy also supports 
English-language education through teacher training courses and 
workshops, and by providing resources, materials, online course 
opportunities, and strong support for teachers.
    Often once someone has had the chance to experience the United 
States in person, the United States has a supporter and ally for life. 
One of the challenges with a smaller country like Slovakia is that it 
is not always offered the number of positions commensurate with demand. 
If confirmed, I will explore how to increase space for Slovaks in U.S. 
programs so we can offer more of them a first-hand introduction to the 
United States.

State Department Manangement and Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID.

   What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission Bratislava?

    Answer. My understanding from the State Department is that morale 
is strong and the mission is well-run. Following Russia's invasion of 
neighboring Ukraine, I understand the mission has been called upon to 
do much more and has met the challenge. One area to which I will give 
attention is the salaries of the Locally Employed staff. If confirmed, 
I will work with Washington colleagues to ensure that Locally Employed 
staff salaries keep up with the labor market. I would also work to 
ensure that the mission has the personnel and tools necessary to carry 
out its expanded responsibilities, if confirmed.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission 
Bratislava?

    Answer. Having served as Deputy Chief of Mission and Charge 
d'Affaires, a.i., in two posts, ensuring high morale was one of my 
chief priorities. I worked closely with the Community Liaison Officer 
(CLO), Management Team, and senior staff to instill a ``One Team'' 
culture where everyone's voice was heard and valued. If confirmed, I 
would utilize similar management techniques in Bratislava and seek to 
foster a workplace of empowerment and open, transparent communication. 
I pledge to hold regular Town Hall meetings, consult with all staff 
(Americans and Locally Employed staff), and convey to them my 
appreciation for the work they do to advance U.S. foreign policy goals.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Bratislava?

    Answer. In my two assignments as Deputy Chief of Mission and Charge 
d'Affaires, a.i., I emphasized that two of my management principles 
were respect and One Team. In regard to the first, I expected all staff 
to treat everyone in the Mission--no matter their nationality or job--
with respect. The latter, that all staff members--no matter their 
agency or section--were part of ``One Team'' working on behalf of the 
American people to further U.S. national interests. I stated these 
principles on my first day in the job, reiterated them to the Country 
Team, and repeated them to every new staff member who joined my 
embassies. If confirmed, I will begin my first speech to the Mission 
Bratislava workforce emphasizing these values, and I will work hard to 
ensure Mission Bratislava's workforce is cohesive, respectful of each 
other, and working as One Team towards our goals and priorities.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. As a manager, I value open communication, empowering my 
team, and holding staff members to high standards. As we work for the 
American people, we have a responsibility to produce on their behalf. 
As a manager, I have a responsibility to my team to create the optimal 
work environment so that we can successfully execute our mission.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. It is never appropriate to berate subordinates, either in 
public or private. Such behavior undermines morale, reduces 
productivity, and is never acceptable from any manger. In multiple 
embassies where I have served as a manager, I have always treated 
subordinates (and all colleagues) with respect. If confirmed, I pledge 
to treat all staff at Mission Bratislava with the utmost respect.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. Having served as Deputy Chief of Mission at two embassies 
with three different ambassadors, I know firsthand that it is the most 
important relationship to ensuring an effective and productive embassy. 
If confirmed, I will work closely with the Deputy Chief of Mission to 
ensure the effective management of Mission Bratislava. I would work to 
develop a relationship of trust and respect, empowering the deputy to 
serve as the Mission's chief operating officer, delegating when 
appropriate, and ensuring he or she can step in for me if I am not 
available. If confirmed, I will work closely with my Deputy Chief of 
Mission to ensure his or her success.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. Having served as Deputy Chief of Mission at two different 
embassies, I believe the role of the Deputy Chief of Mission is to 
serve as the embassy's chief operating officer and as the alter-ego of 
the ambassador. An effective Deputy Chief of Mission ensures the smooth 
operations of the embassy, while also serving as the ambassador's 
senior policy advisor. If confirmed, I will work closely with my Deputy 
Chief of Mission to ensure his or her success.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. As a manager, I have always prioritized providing 
constructive feedback to my team and working closely with them to write 
effective evaluations. In my last two assignments as Deputy Chief of 
Mission, I have led numerous workshops on EER writing, bidding 
strategies, and other career development issues. In my last post, I 
provided feedback on every State Department employee's EER. If 
confirmed, I will continue to place a high priority in proactively 
managing my team and providing them accurate, constructive feedback.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. I fully support these principles and if confirmed, I pledge 
to provide my employees clear, accurate, and direct feedback. I have 
done so in my previous Foreign Service assignments as a manager, 
including when I served as Deputy Chief of Mission and Charge 
d'Affaires.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Slovakia.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. I have served in some of the most dangerous places in the 
world including Mosul, Iraq, Peshawar, Pakistan, and Khost, 
Afghanistan. My experiences taught me it was imperative to balance risk 
with the necessity to engage local populations and authorities to 
advance U.S. national security interests. In these posts, and all of my 
other assignments in the United Arab Emirates, India, Algeria, and 
Slovenia, I have regularly gone outside of the Embassy walls and 
strongly encouraged my teams to do so also.
    My sense from Mission Slovakia is that diplomats are encouraged to 
get out and meet as many people as possible. In fact, my understanding 
is that one of the Embassy themes for the post-COVID era is ``Back to 
the Regions,'' focused specifically on getting out from behind desks 
and our embassy walls and into regions outside the capital of 
Bratislava. If confirmed, I pledge to interact with a wide array of 
Slovaks across the country, and I will encourage the Embassy team to 
follow my example.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. In all of my previous assignments, I have encouraged my 
teams to learn as much as possible about the local populations, 
including their history, culture, religion, and at a minimum, a few 
words of the local language. Most importantly, I have always instructed 
them that it is imperative they learn about local issues from the local 
population, and not just our government interlocutors and other elites. 
If confirmed, I will emphasize these same points to the Mission 
Bratislava team to ensure that the U.S. diplomats under my authority 
travel and meet a wide range of people so they can effectively do their 
jobs. My understanding is that the team in Slovakia regularly travels 
throughout the country, which assisted their efforts to serve U.S. 
citizens and refugees from Ukraine on the border after Putin's invasion 
of Ukraine.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in 
Slovakia?

    Answer. I am told that Slovakia is home to a thriving, professional 
journalist community, and the U.S. Embassy is able to connect and reach 
audiences. Public diplomacy is a core component of our efforts to 
advance U.S. foreign policy priorities in Slovakia, and if I am 
confirmed, that focus will continue. While there is considerable 
interest in the United States across the country and great willingness 
among our partners to support outreach, I understand that polls show 
many Slovaks remain skeptical of the United States and the 
Transatlantic relationship. If confirmed, I pledge to meet regularly 
with a wide range of Slovaks across all fora--in person, on social 
media, via the traditional press--to improve their views of the United 
States and the importance of the transatlantic relationship.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. I understand that COVID-19 has been a significant challenge 
and has impacted in-person public diplomacy and exchange programming in 
Slovakia, as it has everywhere. I am told other challenges to U.S. 
public diplomacy in Slovakia include widespread disinformation from 
malign actors and a public skeptical of the United States and the 
Transatlantic relationship. If confirmed, I pledge to work with the 
Mission's public diplomacy team to increase our outreach to all 
Slovaks, and improve their views of the United States and the 
transatlantic relationship.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. As a long-term Charge d'Affaires at my last two posts in 
Slovenia and Algeria, I worked regularly with colleagues at Main State 
and the embassies' public diplomacy teams to tailor our messages to 
foreign audiences. In Algeria, I led the Near Eastern Affairs Bureau's 
top-ranked public diplomacy team that had 75 percent of all social 
media interactions for the entire bureau (across 19 countries, and over 
25 posts). If confirmed, Mission Bratislava's messaging and engagement 
will be aligned with State Department policy priorities, including 
support for the Transatlantic relationship, strong person-to-person 
outreach and engagement, robust anti-corruption programming, countering 
disinformation and extremism, maintaining and supporting defense 
cooperation, and growing U.S. businesses. As I did in Slovenia and 
Algeria, I will work with the Mission Bratislava team to tailor our 
messages to most effectively reach the local audience.

    Question.  ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat 
seriously?

    Answer. I have previously received classified and unclassified 
briefings on the issue of Anomalous Health Incidents--including the 
interagency effort to protect and care for our personnel and uncover 
the cause of these incidents. These Incidents are an absolute priority 
for the Department, and it would be an absolute priority for me if I am 
confirmed.
    As the President has said, the health and well-being of American 
public servants is of paramount importance to the Administration. On a 
personal level, I have no higher priority than the safety of the 
members of my Embassy team and their family members.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Bratislava personnel?

    Answer. Absolutely. In my recent assignments as Deputy Chief of 
Mission and Charge d'Affaires, I regularly held Town Halls and executed 
a ``management by walking around'' approach. I believe open and 
transparent communication is critical for a workplace to function well, 
and leadership should set the example for that. If confirmed, I pledge 
to bring the same approach to Mission Bratislava.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
           Submitted to Gautam A. Rana by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. Whether we want it or not, the United States is currently 
engaged in a great power competition with the Chinese Communist Party. 
Our European allies and NATO members must recognize the need to take 
the lead to counter Russia's aggression on their doorstep. While 
Slovakia does not yet meet NATO's requirement for members to spend at 
least 2 percent of their GDP on defense spending, it has drastically 
increased its defense spending, including a 40 percent increase in 
2019. Earlier this year, Slovakia's Defense Minister announced that 
Slovakia would treat the 2 percent requirement as a floor and that even 
spending 3 percent of GDP would be necessary. The United States needs 
more NATO members to meet, or exceed, this requirement for their own 
defense to deter Russian aggression.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. The President has made it clear the United States views the 
People's Republic of China (PRC) as a strategic competitor that 
challenges the existing rules-based international order. As Secretary 
Blinken said on May 26, we will invest at home, align our efforts with 
partners and allies, and compete with the PRC to defend our interests 
and build our vision for the future. The United States, our Allies, and 
partners have been clear-eyed on the threat the PRC poses, and Slovakia 
is no exception. For example, Slovakia's Parliament approved a National 
Security Strategy identifying potential challenges posed by China. If 
confirmed, I would work to deepen ties between Washington and 
Bratislava and ensure we leverage the inherent advantages of our 
democracies to ensure the international system remains rooted in 
democratic values, not authoritarian ones.

    Question. How would you describe the role and contributions of 
Slovakia as a NATO ally and how will you press Slovakia to reach the 2 
percent goal and sustain it over time?

    Answer. The United States and Slovakia have a strong defense and 
security relationship that continues to deepen. Slovakia is a stalwart 
NATO ally and has been since joining the Alliance in 2004. Slovakia has 
a strong record of participation in NATO missions within Europe and 
throughout the world, and the Slovak contingent was the last ally on 
the ground in Afghanistan. Following Russia's unprovoked full-scale 
invasion of Ukraine, Slovakia agreed to host a NATO Enhanced Vigilance 
Activities (eVA) battlegroup, within which U.S. troops are currently 
participating. Slovakia takes its burden sharing commitments seriously 
and is in the process of a historic defense modernization effort. 
Slovak leaders have committed to reaching their two percent spending 
goal ahead of 2024--Slovakia's Defense Minister announced earlier this 
year that Slovakia would treat the 2 percent requirement as a floor--
and, if confirmed, I will advocate for sustaining this commitment over 
time.

    Question. While the 2 percent spending goal is a good target, it's 
not the whole story. NATO does not need its members to increase 
spending on pensions, or increasing salaries--we need member states to 
develop new and modern capabilities to keep pace with the threats 
presented by Putin's and the CCP's military.

   To what extent has Putin's invasion of Ukraine bolstered public 
        support for NATO in Slovakia?

    Answer. Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine has 
underscored for all allies the importance of the NATO Alliance. Even 
before the invasion of neighboring Ukraine, Slovakia had embarked upon 
a historic military modernization project, including purchasing F-16 
fighter jets for $1.8 billion and Blackhawk helicopters. Slovakia is 
hosting a NATO Enhanced Vigilance Activities (eVA) battlegroup, in 
which the United States is participating and could result in up to 
3,000 NATO troops eventually deploying to the Slovak Republic. Most 
public polling in Slovakia shows that public support for NATO has been 
increasing. I understand that shortly after Putin's invasion of 
Ukraine, 80 percent of Slovaks support the Government's response to the 
invasion, and a comprehensive poll released in May showed that 72 
percent of Slovaks perceive Slovakia's membership in NATO positively, 
an almost ten percent increase from the year before. This is Slovakia's 
highest level of support for NATO since at least 2018.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
            to Hon. Randy W. Berry by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. In November 2020, I published a Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee majority report entitled ``The United States and Europe: A 
Concrete Agenda for Transatlantic Cooperation on China.'' The report 
gave several recommendations for increased transatlantic cooperation, 
including on Africa, to counter malign Chinese influence more 
effectively.

   In what ways should the United States partner with European 
        countries to build on likeminded interests in Namibia and 
        counter the influence of China and other malign actors?

    Answer. The United States has a number of opportunities to partner 
with European countries to build on likeminded interests, particularly 
in support of democratic principles and practices, the international 
rules-based order, accountability and transparency, and the trade and 
investment sectors. Namibia has vast natural resources from world class 
mineral riches such as diamonds, uranium, and rare earths to high value 
timber and endangered wildlife species. Namibia's mining industry is 
largely undeveloped and would benefit from international investment. 
Namibia also has bold ambitions to develop renewable energy and green 
hydrogen that could advance decarbonization and energy security goals 
in the region and of likeminded partners, notably those in Europe. If 
confirmed, I would work closely with my counterparts from these 
countries to promote trade and investment between Namibia and the 
United States and European countries, thus filling a gap often filled 
by malign actors.

Human Rights
    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons 
Report (TIP), Namibia remained the only sub-Saharan African country 
ranked Tier 1 for meeting minimum standards for the elimination of 
trafficking. Although the Government met minimum standards, it 
prosecuted fewer victims and initiated fewer investigations through the 
reporting year and did not provide specialized training to law 
enforcement for human trafficking practices.

   How will you work with the Namibians to maintain progress as a Tier 
        1 country and to serve as an example among peers in the 
        Southern Africa region if you are confirmed as Ambassador?

    Answer. Maintaining its Tier 1 ranking on the annual trafficking in 
persons (TIP) report is a serious policy priority for the Government of 
Namibia. Youth unemployment, extraordinary socioeconomic disparities 
exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the influx of Angolan climate 
migrants into Namibia have increased TIP vulnerabilities. However, 
Namibia is taking proactive steps to address many of the concerns, as 
encapsulated in the Government of Namibia's revised draft National 
Trafficking in Persons Strategy (2021-2026) and demonstrated by recent 
efforts to repatriate TIP victims from Oman. If confirmed, I will 
leverage USG resources to support the continued development of 
Namibia's judiciary and law enforcement mechanisms to strengthen its 
ability to protect vulnerable persons.

    Question. If confirmed, what concrete steps could you take to help 
Namibia operationalize the prioritized recommendations contained in the 
TIP report?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will leverage available USG resources to 
continue support for training law enforcement and other front-line 
responders to identify and respond to TIP cases. This includes training 
and exchange programs, such as those offered by the International Law 
Enforcement Academy (ILEA), identifying foreign assistance mechanisms 
to bolster Namibia's home-grown efforts to prosecute traffickers, 
protect TIP victims, and prevent TIP altogether. My team and I will 
also amplify messages that aim to raise awareness about TIP and 
encourage accountability--both in private meetings and on public 
platforms.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 Human Rights Report, 
Namibia was identified as having credible reports of serious government 
corruption and poor prison conditions, including overcrowding from 
lengthy pre-trail detentions. The Government has taken steps to 
prosecute or punish officials who committed abuses, but some officials 
engaged in corrupt practices with impunity.

   Do you commit to raising the issue of corruption with the host 
        government?

    Answer. Yes. Corruption is increasingly a threat to the stability 
of Namibia's democratic institutions, the vitality of its economy, and 
the ability of the U.S. Government (USG) to safeguard our investments 
and achieve our strategic goals in Namibia. Though President Geingob 
has strongly messaged the importance of democratic institutions and 
systems and the need for leaders to combat corruption and tribalism, 
recent polls in Namibia indicate shaken faith in democratic leadership 
and serious corruption concerns.
    In line with the anti-corruption call in President Biden's National 
Security Study Memorandum, Embassy Windhoek created an anti-corruption 
plan of action targeting both the public and government to 
simultaneously empower, equip, and advocate to combat corruption. 
Embassy Windhoek has already partnered with civil society to set up a 
National Anti-Corruption Network and online whistleblower portal; 
supported anti-corruption trainings for law enforcement; mentored 
investigative journalists; [designated under section 7031(c) of the 
annual appropriations act and] imposed visa restrictions on officials 
implicated in corruption scandals; and highlighted budgetary loopholes 
for corruption through a fiscal transparency study. If confirmed, I 
plan to build on this foundation, including through frank conversations 
with the host government.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you work with the Namibian 
Government on prison conditions and improving the efficiency of the 
legal system to reduce the length of pre-trial detentions?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will leverage available USG resources to 
continue support for rule of law and human rights in Namibia. This 
includes training and exchange programs, such as those offered by the 
International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA), as well as identifying 
foreign assistance mechanisms to bolster Namibia's home-grown efforts 
to build a more efficient and equitable legal system. My team and I 
will, if confirmed, also encourage progress in private meetings with 
government officials and empower civil society advocates to continue to 
hold Namibia, a member of the U.N Human Rights Council, to a high 
standard in this area.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, Namibia's constitution provides for freedom of belief 
and right to practice, profess, and promote any religion. The 
nongovernmental Interfaith Council consisting of members of various 
Christian and Muslims groups regularly met to discuss and coordinate 
their approach to the Government to address the needs of their 
respective congregations.

   What actions would you take with the host government to continue to 
        promote religious tolerance and freedom?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will encourage the Namibian Government, 
both publicly and privately, to build on the provisions in its 
constitution that prohibit religious discrimination and provide for 
freedom of belief and the right to practice, profess, and promote any 
religion. I will meet with religious leaders of all faiths, and I will 
also work with members of civil society on this issue.

    Question. How could you engage with the Interfaith Council and 
government to further understand the country's religious environment to 
best prevent possible areas of religious discrimination?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to meeting regularly and developing 
strong relationships with all members of the nongovernmental Interfaith 
Council to discuss what actions the United States can take to support 
the provisions in Namibia's constitution that provide for freedom of 
belief and the right to practice, profess, and promote any religion.

Namibia in the United Nations
    Question. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's Bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the United Nations (UN), including 
in elections for specialized bodies like the International 
Telecommunications Union (ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen 
Bodgan-Martin, who if elected would be the first American and first 
woman to lead the ITU. She is in a tough race that will require early, 
consistent engagement across capital and within the U.N member states.

   If confirmed, do you commit to demarching the Namibian Government 
        and any other counterparts necessary to encourage their support 
        of Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. Yes, I commit to continuing to build on previous 
discussions that have already been held between U.S. Embassy Windhoek 
and members of the Namibian Government on Ms. Bogdan-Martin's candidacy 
for Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union.

    Question. If confirmed, how can you work with the Bureau of 
International Organizations and other stakeholders to identify, 
recruit, and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior 
Program Officer (JPO) program at the U.N?

    Answer. The U.N's Junior Professional Officer program supports 
young professionals interested in serving in international 
organizations by providing them with hands-on experience across various 
U.N agencies. If confirmed, I will work closely with the Bureau of 
International Organizations to identify qualified and diverse 
candidates for the JPO program. I will advise and support the work of 
Washington-based colleagues in the Bureau of African Affairs in efforts 
to use their engagements with Namibian officials in Washington, New 
York, Geneva, and elsewhere to advance these goals.

    Question. Namibia has a low rate of voting coincidence with the 
U.S. in the U.N General Assembly and in the Security Council.

   What is your assessment of this issue?

    Answer. Thirty-two years after independence, many top government 
positions are filled with SWAPO's liberation-era fighters who continue 
to harbor Cold War-era suspicions about U.S. intentions in Namibia. 
These suspicions--and in some instances antipathy--are rooted in 
resentment for the United States' previous friendly relations with 
apartheid South Africa and a belief that the United States' negotiating 
posture in the 1980s unnecessarily delayed Namibia's independence by a 
decade.
    In multilateral fora, the Government of Namibia advocates for 
conflict resolution through peaceful dialogue and democratic process 
``anchored on respect of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of 
nations.'' President Geingob has stressed that ``Namibia does not want 
to be put in an awkward position between two competing superpowers.'' 
While Namibia's rhetoric still favors liberation struggle allies, in 
practice the Government is slowly adjusting its policies to be in line 
with international standards and often U.S. interests.

    Question. If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to 
engage with the Namibians on anticipated votes in the U.N.system that 
would increase their voting coincidence with the U.S.?

    Answer. Namibian leaders stress that the country fought hard for 
its independence and places high value on the ability of Namibia to 
shape its own policy. If confirmed, I would work with my team and 
interagency partners to build a true partnership with Namibia that 
advances our common interests and allows the United States to be viewed 
as a reliable partner. On this foundation, we can build a relationship 
in which our shared values are also reflected in our U.N voting 
records. My team and I will engage with Namibian officials to place 
increased value on taking positions and voting in a manner that 
benefits Namibia. We will also continue to encourage Namibia's foreign 
affairs officials to vote for human rights resolutions, even if they 
are single-country resolutions, in line with Namibia's principles--
rather than abstaining.

State Department Manangement and Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Windhoek?

    Answer. Morale at Mission Windhoek, despite the global challenges 
posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic, remains high. Dedication to the 
Mission, strong and consultative leadership by the Charge d'Affaires, 
and good communication have been key, and if confirmed, I look forward 
to using my own leadership to advance positive morale.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Windhoek?

    Answer. I believe that positive morale and the well-being and 
productivity of staff stems from the creation of a respectful, 
consultative environment that allows for the best ideas, concepts, and 
innovations to emerge. Promoting and maintaining a Mission where open 
communication, the free expression of alternative ideas and dissent, 
and community-based initiatives and activities flourish are all key 
elements. The most vital among these principles is treating the team of 
professionals that make up our Mission with respect and trust, and to 
ensure their viewpoints, ideas, and concerns are heard and acted upon.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Windhoek?

    Answer. Common purpose and a unified team are critical, and 
effective communication is the vital foundation. I intend to create 
this environment of ``One Mission, One Team'' by consulting and drawing 
upon four key elements essential to my conception and demonstration of 
leadership. First, adopting a jointly understood vision of USG goals 
and targets is vital, and that is a team effort, produced through 
ongoing and effective communication. Second, a consistent articulation 
of that vision ensures the team remains on a unified track--in Country 
Team meetings, in Town Hall formats, and in our vital planning 
documents. Third, ensuring our team understands how program and 
external engagement supports underlying policy and goals--essentially 
how we turn aspiration into results--is vital. And finally, focusing on 
implementation and achievement built upon that foundation is key. Our 
greatest asset in our Missions overseas are our people, and effective 
communication at all levels is the greatest imperative.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. Over the course of my career, I have relied heavily on the 
components of consultative and servant leadership, and I believe this 
approach to be the most beneficial in delivering a positive work 
environment and tangible achievements for the Mission team, for USG 
policy priorities and for the American people. I believe leaders carry 
the mantle of outlining a vision, based on consultation, and in the 
creation of a management environment that values and rewards 
innovation, bold thinking, and achievement. I believe strongly that 
accessibility, approachability, and understanding that effective 
communication doesn't simply lie in speaking well, but in listening 
well, are the key components of success.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No. It is never acceptable or constructive to berate 
subordinates in any setting, public or private.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. Leadership is a true team effort, and the relationship 
between a Chief of Mission and Deputy Chief of Mission, the most vital 
in the Mission, depends heavily on trust, open communication, and a 
shared approach and vision. Collaborative and consultative leadership 
requires the DCM to speak openly and honestly on issues facing the 
Mission, both in policy and operational terms. I will invest my support 
and trust to my DCM and ensure that our Mission team understands we 
speak with one voice on issues facing the community and our policy 
priorities. Essential for the success of that approach is a 
professional relationship where honest and open dialogue forms the 
foundation.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. Though the ultimate responsibility for defining leadership 
rests on the shoulders of the Chief of Mission, the most generous 
sharing of responsibilities is vital as we look to develop the next 
generation of Foreign Service Officers. I intend to partner fully with 
my DCM to define and deliver the type of collaborative leadership that 
creates the type of professional environment most conducive to 
professional growth and achievement. Leadership at its core is a team 
sport, and effective communication is vital.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Not only do I believe it is important; I believe it is 
absolutely critical to do so to achieve our common Mission goals, and 
also to shape and prepare the next generation of Foreign Service 
professionals to lead and succeed. Over many years of service, I have 
used constructive and clear feedback and discussion with employees at 
all levels to improve performance, establish new targets for 
achievement, and create opportunity. Vital in that is also the ability 
to identify, cite, and recognize achievement through awards, 
promotions, and recognition.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit fully to supporting and encouraging 
clear, accurate and direct feedback. I have found this to be a 
critically important skill as I have assumed roles of greater 
responsibility throughout my nearly 30-year career with the State 
Department.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Namibia.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. I firmly believe that the key imperative for our diplomats 
posted overseas is to get to know the country of assignment as 
thoroughly as possible, and that cannot be done adequately by remaining 
in the office. Engagement, relationship-building, and understanding is 
only possible through personal contact and experience. Diplomacy is a 
full-contact sport, and if confirmed, I will make this approach a 
priority for myself and my team, so that we can most faithfully execute 
on our goals--because we know and understand our environment.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work closely with the Regional 
Security Officer and team at Post to ensure that the staff at Embassy 
Windhoek have the means and resources to safely travel and access all 
local populations in order to further USG priorities. I will always 
seek to balance the importance of person-to-person engagements with the 
safety of my staff.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in 
Namibia?

    Answer. Historically, suspicion of the United States for the role 
it played during the liberation struggle dominated public sentiment. 
With a new generation, that narrative is starting to fade, but 
Namibians are wary of dueling U.S.-China relationships in their 
country. However, in a country with 50 percent youth unemployment and 
one of the world's highest levels of inequality, economic and social 
concerns far outweigh political ideology for young people. Young 
Namibians increasingly want to go to the United States, not to 
immigrate, but to create professional and social opportunities for 
themselves. American freedom, lifestyles, and culture are very 
compelling for the new generation of Namibians. There is renewed 
interest in participating in U.S. exchange programs, and, if confirmed 
I will strive to utilize the full gambit of public diplomacy tools, 
including though social media outreach, cultural and social diplomacy, 
and new media.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. Namibians are somewhat skeptical of our message, and there 
is some sentiment that the U.S.-Namibia relationship is in effect more 
about countering China than building a genuine partnership with 
Namibia. Exchange programs, as well as continued investment in people--
whether in the health or education sectors, among others--will continue 
to move the needle with the Namibian public. High-level meetings and 
visits also matter; they demonstrate that our stated commitment to 
U.S.-Africa collaboration on shared global priorities, including ending 
the COVID-19 pandemic and building back to a more inclusive global 
economy, combatting the climate crisis, revitalizing our democracies, 
and advancing peace and security is more than just words.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. Public diplomacy messages should have an objective and an 
intended audience. Determining the source, content, or method of 
delivering those messages, requires a nuanced assessment of the 
audience(s), their orientation, how to influence them, and potential 
unintended reactions by primary or other audiences. The issue, 
circumstance, and audience should inform whether the in-country Mission 
or Main State is better positioned to achieve the objective. Often, 
messaging from Post/in-country Mission has the benefit of more 
targeted, time-responsive messaging, and is met with greater 
authenticity, as long as it is coordinated and within Department of 
State guidance. Accessibility, engagement, and authenticity enhance our 
ability to connect and inform, and if confirmed, I intend to engage 
substantially across our platforms and using all our tools, to 
communicate America's story, and our USG priorities.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. I am deeply concerned by potential anomalous health 
incidents impacting U.S. Government personnel and their family members. 
These incidents affect the wellbeing of U.S. personnel serving their 
country abroad and must be taken extremely seriously. If confirmed, I 
will make the health and safety of my staff my top priority, including 
contributing to the extensive, ongoing interagency investigation into 
the cause of these incidents and how we can best protect our people. 
Reported cases will be taken seriously, and proper treatment and 
support from the USG will be provided. If confirmed, the health, 
safety, and security of Embassy Windhoek staff and all those supporting 
the Mission will be my highest priority.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Windhoek personnel?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit fully to leading our team in Mission 
Windhoek through effective and frequent communication, driven by honest 
and clear discussions.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
             to Hon. Randy W. Berry by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. Namibia and the People's Republic of China maintain close 
trade ties and warm relations. The CCP enjoys a prominent role in 
Namibia's mining sector and have financed major infrastructure, to 
include a major shipping port. Namibia's president Geingob has praised 
Beijing and signed a number of agreements to increase bilateral 
partnerships. Namibia's ruling party has particularly strong relations 
with the CCP, conducting regular party-to-party trainings. The CCP is 
filling a vacuum left by the United States' indifference as a partner. 
Reportedly, Beijing has been in discussion with Namibia to open a naval 
base in Walvis Bay, which would significantly increase the PLA Navy's 
power projection capabilities.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. Certain activities by the People's Republic of China (PRC) 
and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) represent significant challenges to 
U.S. economic, political, and security interests globally and in the 
Africa region. The PRC has used its influence abroad in ways that 
undermine laws, agreements, and institutions which has the effect of 
undermining rule of law and democratic principles. The port of Walvis 
Bay is a significant nexus for southern Atlantic security and could be 
an important opportunity for partnership with the United States. As 
Secretary Blinken said on May 26, we will invest, align, and compete 
with the PRC to defend our interests and build our vision for the 
future. If confirmed, I will invest in our partnership with Namibia, 
align our concerns highlighting the risks associated with PRC 
engagement that could impact Namibia's security, democratic principles, 
sovereignty, and U.S. interests, and ensure that our vision of a 
positive partnership and regional security and prosperity competes 
successfully with the PRC.

    Question. What is the nature and extent of CCP ties with Namibia 
and what are their implications for U.S. interests?

    Answer. The People's Republic of China (PRC) maintains strong and 
rapidly growing economic ties to Namibia; in 2021, the PRC was 
Namibia's second largest export destination and second largest source 
of imports. Additionally, Namibia is home to vast amounts of natural 
resources and mineral wealth; in addition to uranium, diamonds, gold, 
copper, and zinc, Namibia has rich deposits of critical minerals, all 
of which are of great interest to the PRC. While Namibia recognizes 
U.S. global engagement and appreciates U.S. support in the health and 
conservation fields, Namibia sees its relationship to the PRC through 
the lens of ``friend to all, enemy to none,'' particularly given 
historic support from the PRC in the struggle for Namibia's 
independence. Namibia values its hard-built democracy and independent 
institutions, and our common commitment to democratic principles, 
transparency, and the fundamental freedoms should guide our efforts. If 
confirmed, I commit to building key relationships with senior 
leadership and others to emphasize the values, interests, and 
commitment of the USG to act as a key partner for the Namibian 
Government and people.

    Question. What can the U.S. do to counter the CCP's influence in 
Namibia?

    Answer. There are a number of opportunities for the United States 
to counter the PRC's influence in Namibia. First and foremost, being a 
present and active partner is key, guided by foundational democratic 
principles and fundamental freedoms. While the United States and 
Namibia currently have a limited commercial relationship, largely due 
to Namibia's small market, there are growing possibilities for U.S. 
businesses to invest in renewable energy, green hydrogen, critical 
minerals, transportation infrastructure, specialized business services, 
and tourism. Continued investment in Namibia's conservation and health 
sectors could also play a significant role as the United States seeks 
to counter the PRC's influence in Namibia.
    It is vital, as well, to articulate U.S. engagement and values 
through effective public outreach, and to ensure that transparency and 
accountability are key standards defining any democracy's external 
engagements. A free and independent media, and environment in which 
public tenders and contracts are fully examined and visible to the 
press and public are vital. That environment also creates opportunities 
for the power of the U.S. private sector to engage more fully and 
engage in economic activities that benefit inclusive development with 
respect for the environment, a key interest for the country. If Namibia 
is to succeed in the development of its economy, that development 
should come with support to her democratic institutions and practices, 
to her people through expanded training and employment, and support her 
sovereignty.

    Question. Please assess the Namibian Government's record on human 
rights. How free and fair are elections in Namibia?

    Answer. Since independence, the Namibian Government has maintained 
a strong record on human rights, though some challenges obviously 
remain, as outlined in the State Department's historical human rights 
reports. Namibia has made combatting trafficking in persons a key 
policy priority and has maintained its Tier 1 ranking on the USG annual 
trafficking in persons (TIP) report. Namibia also ranks at the very top 
consistently in terms of press freedoms--an essential component for the 
health of a democracy and a force for transparency, accountability, and 
anti-corruption efforts. Religious freedoms are also generally 
respected and valued.
    Namibia has been a stable democracy since independence from South 
Africa in 1990, and its elections since independence have met 
international standards for free and fair administration. It has a 
democratically elected parliament, an independent judiciary, free 
media, and a military that is fully subordinate to civilian leadership. 
President Hage Geingob was re-elected to his second and final five-year 
term in free and fair elections held peacefully in November 2019. His 
party, SWAPO, is the only political party to lead Namibia in its 32-
year history.

                       WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 3, 2022

                                       U.S. Senate,
                            Committee on Foreign Relations,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:04 a.m., in 
Room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Cory A. 
Booker presiding.
    Present: Senators Booker [presiding], Menendez, Cardin, 
Murphy, Kaine, Van Hollen, Portman, Young, and Rounds.
    Also Present: Senator King and Representative Norton.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CORY A. BOOKER, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY

    Senator Booker. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
hearing will come to order now.
    I cannot tell you how excited I am. We have an 
extraordinary group of people who have dedicated their lives to 
public service, folks who are so talented they have many other 
options.
    Each and every one of you sitting before me and the ranking 
member right now are defining patriotism in the sense of your 
willingness to sacrifice in the name of service to country, and 
I greet you in that spirit and I am very excited.
    This is not just a perfunctory process. This is a 
celebration of what we are about as a country, a country run by 
our citizens who step forward to serve in difficult times.
    I am honored to be here today next to Senator Rounds, a 
ranking member who gives me great confidence and hope for our 
Senate to be able to actually function and I am sure this is 
going to be a very functional hearing.
    I want to just jump right in. The five people before us 
right now are Nathaniel Fick, who is to be the Ambassador-at-
Large for Cyberspace and Digital Policy. I am so happy that we 
are looking at cyberspace and digital policy and having someone 
up to lead that. We thank the President for that nomination.
    We also have Mr. Michael Schiffer to be Assistant 
Administrator for Asia and U.S. Agency for International 
Development (USAID) and we are very excited about that.
    Perhaps at this point there should be a hush in the crowd 
because we are about to introduce someone from New Jersey. I 
want to introduce Ms. Rachna Korhonen, who is from, of course, 
the Garden State to be Ambassador to the Republic of Mali.
    And then we have Lucy--Ms. Lucy Tamlyn to be Ambassador to 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, finally, Ms. Jessica 
Davis Ba to be Ambassador to the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire.
    And I am very happy to see--some of you have already seen 
one of my favorite people in the United States Senate, Senator 
Angus King from Maine. He is going to be introducing the man to 
his right, Mr. Nathaniel Fick.
    Senator King, you are recognized. You can give your 
remarks. I know that we are in one of the most demanding weeks 
in the United States Senate. So after your remarks, no one will 
look askance at you if you leave and duck out.
    You are recognized.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. ANGUS KING,
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE

    Senator King. Senator, thank you very much.
    I was excited when you said I was one of your favorite 
people. But then you qualified by saying, in the United States 
Senate.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator King. So that narrowed it somewhat substantially.
    I am delighted to be with you this morning and to introduce 
Nate Fick. But I want to begin by a little bit of a description 
of the office that he is going to be taking and how important 
it is.
    As you and the Vice Chair know, I worked for several years 
on cybersecurity policy for this country as part of the 
Cyberspace Solarium Commission.
    One of our principal recommendations was the creation of an 
office or a bureau in the State Department to deal with 
international issues relating to cyber and they can be anything 
from coordinating international response to a cyber attack to 
establishing norms and standards in cyberspace--a kind of 
Geneva Convention of cyber--and also participating in 
international panels that set standards for the internet that, 
frankly, this country has not been as active in as we should 
be.
    This recommendation has been turned into something called 
the Cyber Diplomacy Act, which has passed the House and is 
going to be considered in the near future by this committee.
    I commend it to you as an urgent piece of legislation. What 
it does is codify the concept of an office within the office of 
the State Department to confront and deal with these issues.
    The idea is we want someone who gets up every morning 
thinking about the international ramifications of cyber and 
that is what this office will do.
    Mr. Fick has been appointed to head a bureau of cyber 
policy in the State Department. But this is a creation of the 
Administration.
    I commend the Administration for taking the initiative to 
create this office within the State Department. But I believe 
we also need legislation to codify the existence of the office 
so it is not something that may come and go with the whim of a 
particular Administration.
    So you are going to be seeing the Cyber Diplomacy Act. I 
believe it was scheduled originally for today. It has been 
postponed because of the NATO activity this afternoon.
    But I hope that you will give prompt consideration to that 
bill. It has been--has a lot of work gone into it and I look 
forward to working with you on it, hopefully, prompt enactment.
    Let me introduce Nate Fick. He is from Maine.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator King. Oh, sorry. Oh, yeah, there are some other 
things.
    Actually, if you took a blank sheet of paper and tried to 
design a person to fit this new position, you would have come 
up with someone of Nate Fick's extraordinary qualifications and 
background.
    A Marine--I made the mistake once of calling Senator 
Roberts a former Marine. He informed me there is no such thing 
as a former Marine. If you are a Marine, you are a Marine.
    And he served in Iraq and Afghanistan, later served as the 
CEO of a nonprofit, Center for New American Security, at which 
time he dealt with issues of cyber and international 
ramifications of cyber.
    He then has worked in the private sector as the CEO of a 
software company--again, involved in issues of cyber. He has a 
degree in policy from the Kennedy School and also business from 
the Harvard Business School. Immensely well qualified, very 
thoughtful, engaged in this issue, and I think, as I said, I 
cannot imagine a better candidate to fulfill this position and 
the fact that he is from the state of Maine is simply gravy.
    But, Mr. Chairman, I commend Nathan Fick to you, and I 
apologize, I do have to go off to a hearing of the Rules 
Committee on the Electoral Count Act, which is a matter of some 
concern to all of us.
    I appreciate your courtesy this morning and I look forward 
to working with the committee to advance this nomination.
    Thank you.
    Senator Booker. We are honored that you are here. The 
spirit of Joshua Chamberlain, one of the greatest American 
heroes who happens to be from Maine, is looking down upon the 
two of you with pride.
    I now want to move on to a person of the 535 of us that 
serve in the United States Senate and Congress. This is one of 
the handful that when they walk in the room people take note.
    We are very fortunate to have Representative Eleanor Holmes 
Norton here and she will be introducing--and forgive me, I have 
been sitting on the dock of the bay too long but Ms. Jessica 
Davis Ba, forgive me right now.
    Ms. Norton, you are recognized.

           STATEMENT OF HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, 
               U.S. DELEGATE FROM WASHINGTON, DC.

    Ms. Norton. Thank you. Can you hear me?
    Senator Booker. I can. I am not sure if the microphone is 
on. Yes. You are good to go.
    Ms. Norton. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, I appreciate 
the opportunity to introduce my constituent, Jessica Davis Ba, 
to be the U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire.
    She brings the experience and credentials to be an 
excellent ambassador. A fifth-generation Washingtonian who grew 
up in the Shepherd Park neighborhood of the District of 
Columbia, Ms. Davis Ba has worked for the last 20 years in the 
State Department.
    She currently serves as the senior adviser to the Bureau of 
African Affairs where she focuses on recruitment, selection, 
and retention of Foreign Service officers, in particular, 
officers of color.
    Prior to this assignment, she served in Nigeria, Guinea, 
Kenya, Somalia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Chad. She 
also worked in the office of Vice President Kamala Harris as 
her special advisor for Africa and senior coordinator of the 
National Security Affairs team where she coordinated the work 
of advisers on national security and global issues and engaged 
on the Vice President's behalf with the National Security 
Council to develop U.S. foreign policy.
    Ms. Davis Ba has been awarded numerous academic fellowships 
and State Department awards, including the One Team award and 
was named a, quote, ``top 50 among 50'', a U.S. national 
security and foreign affairs leader by the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies and the Diversity in National 
Security Network in 2021.
    A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, Ms. Davis Ba 
received a bachelor's degree in international relations and 
environmental studies and a master's degree in communications, 
specializing in the use of media to empower underrepresented 
people to make their own image and have their voices heard.
    I very much appreciate the committee for moving on Mr. 
Davis Ba's nomination.
    Senator Booker. Congresswoman, we, again, appreciate your 
presence here before us. We all take note of that and we thank 
you for that eloquent introduction.
    You may take your leave at any time. I know there are a lot 
of demands on your time in a very busy day. So thank you very 
much for being here.
    I would like to proceed now with the remainder of the 
introductions, if I may. The first, it is an absolute pleasure 
to introduce a particularly special nominee to every member and 
staffer on this committee today and that is Michael Schiffer, 
the President's nominee to be the assistant administrator for 
the Asia Bureau of USAID.
    I would like to think that we on this committee taught him 
every single thing that he knows. But really, unfortunately, I 
must confess publicly it is probably the other way around. He 
has been an extraordinary staffer. He has been a senior advisor 
and counselor on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff 
coordinating Asia-related policy.
    Mr. Schiffer brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to 
his job, where he has shown an extraordinary commitment to this 
committee, its mission, and to ensuring that U.S. foreign 
policy represents the best of our collective shared American 
values.
    No matter how many rounds of text negotiations we put him 
through, he somehow has survived and is better for it.
    Senator Cardin. Mr. Chairman, could I ask you to just yield 
for one moment?
    Senator Booker. I will yield to you at any time, Senator 
Cardin.
    Senator Cardin. I just want to add my appreciation to Mike 
Schiffer.
    I chaired the East Asia and Pacific Subcommittee and he was 
the principal staff person. And you are right, it was just the 
reverse. We have learned so much from his experience. He is 
such a dedicated public servant.
    I know he will do well in the executive branch. We are 
going to miss him in the legislative branch. I just really want 
to thank him for his service on this committee and to the 
members of our committee.
    Senator Booker. I thank you for that added hallelujah and 
amen we would call it in my church. I appreciate that 
testifying.
    I just want to continue and say Mr. Schiffer served as the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia and worked 
for the Honorable Dianne Feinstein, senator from California, as 
senior national security adviser and legislative director.
    Prior to working for the Department of Defense, Mr. 
Schiffer worked for the Stanley Foundation where he was a 
program officer responsible for Asia programs. He was a Council 
on Foreign Relations Hitachi International Affairs Fellow in 
Japan, and he served as director of the International 
Securities Program at New York University's Center for War, 
Peace, and News Media.
    In addition to his public service, Mr. Schiffer has also 
had some colorful life experiences, including managing a bed 
and breakfast in--I do not know why not New Jersey but in 
Hawaii. I look forward to quizzing the nominee on the best 
bagel spots for this New Jersey boy if I visit the island.
    Mr. Schiffer's regional experience and intricate knowledge 
of Congress make him an excellent candidate to oversee the Asia 
Bureau's development assistance program's budget and allocation 
of resources.
    As the U.S. grapples with complex challenges, immense 
opportunities in the Indo-Pacific region from strategic 
competition with China to the current global food crisis, from 
mitigating the impact of climate change to combating emerging 
infectious diseases, from preventing democratic backsliding to 
protecting the human rights of minority communities, there is a 
lot to do.
    I look forward to hearing from him on the importance of 
U.S. engagement in the region and how USAID can foster 
sustainable, resilient, and innovative development.
    I want to congratulate you on your nomination, and before I 
move on to the next nominee you should know that usually the 
tradition is that Chris Murphy on his birthday usually runs a 
marathon, but instead of doing the 27 miles today he is here to 
be here for you. So that is a particular honor.
    All right. We now move to the great--we put her in the 
center to mark her importance--from New Jersey, I want to--
again, Rachna Sachdeva Korhonen, I want to thank you for being 
here.
    You hale from Hunterdon County, the mighty Hunterdon 
County, and you are joined today by your beautiful family, who 
I had a chance to briefly meet--your husband, Juha, your 
mother, Meena, and your two sons. I am grateful for them being 
here.
    You are a career member of the Senior Foreign Service. You 
are currently serving as the executive director of the combined 
executive offices of the State Department's Bureau of Near 
Eastern Affairs and Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs.
    Previously, you were the counsel general and principal 
officer for the U.S. Consulate to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
Your experience is vast. You led the management section of the 
U.S. Embassy in Sri Lanka and in Washington you served as a 
special assistant to the Undersecretary for Management.
    Among your other assignments you served in various 
capacities at embassies all across the Middle East. Before 
joining the State Department you worked in multiple leadership 
positions in the private sector and you bring that rare 
combination of private and public center experience at the 
highest of levels.
    Now that I have listed your resume, let me say this. Once 
confirmed, you will bring leadership, experience, character, 
and a dedication and passion to this nation's security and 
economic success.
    It is so valuable that you are before us right now, and 
Mali especially was once seen as a democratic leader. It has 
now become the epicenter of conflict and instability over the 
past decade, exemplifying the challenges we are having in the 
Sahel region.
    Military officers we have seen have led to the overthrow of 
an elected president just as recently as August of 2020, which 
seemed, unfortunately, to be that part of a trend really 
fueling governance challenges in that entire region.
    We know the crisis that we are seeing in the Sahel region 
and we know that in May of 2021 soldiers overthrew the civilian 
transitional leaders whom they had put in place and put in a 
transition president in 2021.
    We know that Islamist insurgents affiliated with al-Qaeda 
and the Islamic State are active in much of central and 
northern Mali.
    Further, the conflict has affected parts of the country and 
parts of the country are experiencing serious crisis level food 
insecurity.
    Mali has one of the world's highest rates of acute 
malnutrition. It is clear that the U.N. peacekeeping mission in 
Mali is not enough to prevent mass suffering, instability, and 
death and, potentially, the spread of greater and greater 
terrorist activities.
    It is clear that the U.S. must do more and we must have the 
most talented people possible serving in our efforts in Mali.
    So I want to congratulate you on your nomination. I am 
sobered by the challenges before you but I am looking forward 
to hearing from you on how you will assess the United States' 
priorities in Mali, how you will meet the challenges and bring 
your inner Jersey to bear on a difficult situation.
    I now am grateful to have a privilege of introducing 
another person going to another very challenging region, Ms. 
Lucy Tamlyn.
    Ms. Tamlyn is the nominee to be the Ambassador to the 
Democratic Republic of Congo. She is a career member of the 
Senior Foreign Service and is currently the Charge d'Affaires 
for the U.S. Embassy in Sudan. We are very, very grateful for 
your work there currently.
    Previously, she served as the U.S. Ambassador to the 
Central Africa Republic, U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of 
Benin, and as Deputy Chief of Mission in the U.S. embassies in 
Portugal and in Chad.
    In addition, she has experience at U.S. missions to the 
United States--to the United Nations and its specialized 
agencies as economic counselor at the U.S. mission to the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and as a 
provincial reconstruction team leader in Erbil.
    I will spare the committee this incredible resume I, 
literally, could read for another 10 more minutes. You have an 
extensive degree of service under presidents of both parties. 
You are a testimony, in my opinion, to what it means to 
dedicate your life to this nation's well being, its safety, and 
relationships around the world.
    We know the challenges in the DRC. Under former President 
Kabila they were characterized by human rights abuses, 
corruptions, and impunity.
    The new president vowed to address these issues. Yet, three 
years later, several senior military officers responsible for 
gross, gross violations of human rights remain at their posts 
and cooperation, again, appears--corruption, again, appears 
rampant.
    I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts on how the 
U.S. can compete strategically in this incredibly important 
nation because we know that China is the largest consumer of 
DRC-mined cobalt and copper and the DRC's largest trading 
partner.
    China firms reportedly control the majority of the DRC 
copper and cobalt mining projects and output. DRC is a critical 
supplier of rare earth metals and other materials for things 
like batteries for electric cars.
    And so I am confident that Ms. Tamlyn's extensive 
experience as part of the Foreign Service make her eminently 
qualified, make you a great asset and an excellent choice by 
the President of the United States for this role.
    Congratulations on your nomination. I look forward to 
hearing from you as well.
    And, again, I am honored to be sitting next to my Ranking 
Member Rounds. I would like to turn to him for his thoughtful 
opening statement as well.

                STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE ROUNDS, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA

    Senator Rounds. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to 
all of our nominees and to your families for your service to 
our country.
    All of you have served our nation as either a service 
member, senior political appointee, or a career diplomat. You 
have made sacrifices in the service of your country and, in 
some cases, with much of your lives and sometimes those of your 
families spent away from home. I thank you for your service to 
our nation.
    Mr. Fick, thank you for your service in the Marine Corps 
and your eagerness to continue to serve as our first ever 
Ambassador-at-Large for Cyberspace and Digital Policy. Thank 
you for the opportunity to visit yesterday. It was very 
enlightening.
    Cyberspace presents myriad opportunities and challenges for 
our national security, economy, and foreign policy. The United 
States, our allies, and partners face an increasingly complex 
and interconnected global security environment with threats in 
cyberspace posed by state actors, most notably Russia and the 
People's Republic of China, as well as nonstate actors.
    We need to take a hard look at our foreign policy as it 
relates to cyberspace and how we can be proactively engaged to 
defend U.S. interests. I appreciate your willingness to serve 
as the first leader of the State Department's newly created 
Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy, a very challenging 
assignment.
    Mr. Schiffer, thank you for your service in the Department 
of Defense and your long service as a congressional staff 
member. I am glad to see an experienced senior advisor like you 
as the nominee for Assistant Administrator for Asia in USAID.
    Across Asia, USAID plays an important role in helping 
countries achieve sustainable long-term growth and success. 
Through development partnerships such as the Quad between 
Australia, India, Japan, and the United States and with the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, USAID supports 
developing countries in Asia to realize their development goals 
and contribute to a more prosperous and, hopefully, peaceful 
world.
    USAID is a critical pillar of the U.S. foreign policy and I 
look forward to hearing how you plan to further U.S.-Asian 
relationships and provide development assistance to developing 
countries in Asia.
    Ms. Korhonen, Mali, like other nations in the Sahel, faces 
the rise of Islamist militancy and other troubling trends. The 
eighth largest country in Africa, Mali, over the last few 
years, has had two coups, persistent insecurity, significant 
challenges in implementing the Algiers Accords, and the 
intervention of malign actors including the Wagner Group.
    Mali will remain central to the Administration's strategy 
for the Sahel and to broader U.S. interests in the region. 
Beyond engagement with the current military junta in Mali and 
the other domestic challenges that Mali faces, the U.S. must 
also balance complex regional and multilateral interests 
related to the U.N. peacekeeping mission, counterterrorism 
operations, and the role of France as it draws down its 
presence, along with other Western partners.
    So you have your work cut out for you, and I thank you, Ms. 
Korhonen, for being willing to serve the United States in Mali. 
I look forward to hearing how you will approach the complex 
issues you will face as a U.S. Ambassador, if confirmed.
    Ambassador Tamlyn, you have served the United States in a 
number of challenging posts, including several in Africa. Your 
next post in the Democratic Republic of Congo, if confirmed, 
will be no less challenging.
    I thank you for being willing to serve in the places we 
most need experienced ambassadors who understand Africa as well 
as the U.S. priorities and challenges on the continent.
    In the DRC, the United States has been a strong partner to 
the Administration of President Tshisekedi since the 
controversial elections in 2018 that saw the end to more than 
two decades of rule by the Kabila family.
    While there have been some efforts at reform, progress has 
been slow to deeply entrenched interests and power dynamics in 
the DRC as well as ongoing insecurity in eastern Congo that has 
become even more worrying in recent weeks with the resurgence 
of M-23.
    Ambassador Tamlyn, I look forward to hearing from you and 
how you plan to pursue U.S. priorities in the DRC, if 
confirmed, particularly with the elections expected late next 
year and, once again, I most certainly appreciated your visit 
yesterday and look forward to your discussion with us today.
    Ms. Davis Ba, you have had a long career serving the United 
States in some of the most challenging posts on the African 
continent. Your experience serving in both Chad and Nigeria, 
both important players in the continent, will serve us well in 
your new role as the U.S. Ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire, if 
confirmed.
    If confirmed, you will need to engage our Ivoirian partners 
on a number of important issues to include preventing and 
countering violent extremism, trade and investment, global 
health, and the implementation of the Millennium Challenge 
Corporation compact.
    I thank you, Ms. Davis Ba, for your willingness to continue 
to serve the United States in Africa in a country that is 
important to U.S. policy objectives for the entire region.
    I am delighted to meet with all of you today and look 
forward to your comments.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Booker. Thank you to my ranking member.
    We are going to now proceed through your introductory 
comments. We are going to go from my left, actually, to my 
right, starting with Ms. Ba, ending with Mr. Fick.
    A pro tip, though, as you prepare to go. Please introduce 
your family and friends behind you. If there is anything I know 
about getting on the good side of Tim Kaine there are three 
things he likes. In fact, there is three things he loves: 
family, friends, and big bald senators from New Jersey.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. Ms. Ba, please proceed with your opening 
statement.

 STATEMENT OF JESSICA DAVIS BA OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, A 
     CAREER MEMBER OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF 
    COUNSELOR, NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND 
PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC 
                        OF COTE D'IVOIRE

    Ms. Ba. Thank you so much, Senator.
    Well, first, then I would like to introduce my family. I am 
joined with me today by my husband, Amadu Mahtar Ba, by my son, 
Alioune--he is the oldest of my five sons representing all of 
the Ba boys here today--and my mom, Janice Davis.
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, distinguished members of this 
committee, it is the greatest honor of my diplomatic career to 
appear before you this morning as President Biden's nominee to 
be the next U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire.
    I appreciate the confidence of the President and Secretary 
Blinken for entrusting me with this opportunity of a lifetime. 
If confirmed, I will advance our bilateral relationship and 
build upon our enduring partnership for the benefit of all 
Americans and all Ivoirians.
    I am here today to continue my family's legacy of service. 
We are Washingtonians. We are educators, public servants, and 
veterans. We are patriots who have chosen life in our nation's 
capital dedicated to improving our country and our global 
community.
    I made my first solo trip overseas in high school to 
volunteer with Operation Crossroads Africa and decided then to 
pursue life in the international community.
    If confirmed, I will serve and lead to empower all people 
to achieve their greatest potential and make a difference in 
our world. I recognize the enormity of this moment that I share 
with my family, who support me every step of this journey. I 
have introduced to you already my husband, Mahtar, and our five 
sons, and if confirmed they will accompany me to Abidjan.
    We have served to advance common values in the interests of 
the United States in Nigeria, Guinea, Somalia, Kenya, Iraq, 
Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Chad. My late grandmother, Doris 
Haynes, a retired D.C. public school principal, accompanied us, 
celebrating her 90th birthday in Nairobi.
    Through our service, my parents, Janice and Joseph Davis, 
my brother, Jay, and his family and our friends discover the 
world through our lived experience.
    This is an important moment for the people of Cote 
d'Ivoire. They have taken bold strides to strengthen democracy 
through political dialogue and reconciliation. With its 
national development plan, the country is building the 
foundation for a prosperous future.
    Ivoirians are investing to reap democratic dividends and, 
if confirmed, I will prioritize partnerships to achieve our 
common goals, aspirations, and vision for the future.
    I will encourage Cote d'Ivoire's political leaders to 
continue on the path towards peace, fortifying democratic 
institutions with every single step. Through our embassy 
programs we are prioritizing freedom of expression, political 
competition, and universal human rights. We will emphasize 
greater participation of women in the economic, political, and 
social fabric of the nation.
    The partnership between the United States and Cote d'Ivoire 
is vital to meet the unprecedented global and regional 
challenges of this moment. Terrorist activity is on the rise in 
west Africa as violent extremist organizations in the Sahel 
seek to expand their influence into coastal states.
    Cote d'Ivoire's neighbors are besieged by 
extraconstitutional changes in power and disinformation is 
prevalent in Ivoirian social media. The unjustifiable war in 
Ukraine has increased food and fuel prices for the people of 
Cote d'Ivoire and around the world.
    Yet, through all these challenges, our partnerships remain 
strong. Together, we strengthen democracy, expand economic 
prosperity, and increase security.
    Cote d'Ivoire's economic performance is extraordinary, with 
enormous potential for increased trade and U.S. commercial 
investment and, if confirmed, I will expand opportunities for 
American companies to unleash innovation and contribute to a 
private sector that encourages transparency, entrepreneurship, 
and inclusive growth.
    A country is strongest when its citizens experience safety 
and security. If confirmed, I will work closely with you, 
members of this committee, and colleagues across the U.S. 
Government to increase health security, enhance Ivoirian 
military capabilities, and strengthen community resilience.
    I will capitalize on new opportunities provided by the 
Global Fragility Act, landmark legislation made possible 
through bipartisan congressional support.
    If confirmed, I will lead our mission to strengthen 
democratic institutions, deepen economic and cultural ties, and 
expand partnerships based on mutual respect between the United 
States and Cote d'Ivoire.
    Thank you so much for your consideration, and I look 
forward to your questions.

    Senator Booker. We thank you for that presentation.
    And I would like to now move to Ms. Lucy Tamlyn.

STATEMENT OF HON. LUCY TAMLYN OF RHODE ISLAND, A CAREER MEMBER 
 OF THE FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINSTER-COUNSELOR, NOMINATED 
   TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE 
  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE 
                             CONGO

    Ms. Tamlyn. Thank you, Senator.
    To start off, I would like to introduce my cousins, Jessie 
and Kevin, who are here behind me.
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the committee, 
it is an honor for me to appear before you today. I am grateful 
to President Biden and Secretary Blinken for the confidence 
that they have placed in me as their nominee for the Ambassador 
to the Democratic Republic of the Congo--that is, DRC.
    Representing the United States abroad is something that I 
have done together with my husband, Jorge Serpa, and children, 
Ben and Filipa, who, unfortunately, were not able to be here 
today. I thank them for their unwavering support and their 
enthusiasm across many continents.
    In a career spanning 40 years of service, I have most 
recently served as Charge d'Affaires in Sudan, Ambassador to 
the Central African Republic, and Ambassador to the Republic of 
Benin.
    I feel privileged to have served in the countries where we 
are, literally, on the front lines, where U.S. diplomacy really 
matters, and side by side with colleagues who answer the call, 
despite the personal, family, and health sacrifices entailed.
    Looking after the safety of the embassy community and 
ensuring that each and every American or local employee can 
flourish and bring his or her best to the job in an environment 
free of harassment and discrimination is my highest priority as 
a leader.
    Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, the United States 
has important interests in the DRC. This enormous country is 
home to 47 percent of Africa's tropical rainforests. The 
minerals and metals under its soil, if responsibly extracted, 
will help power the globe's transition to clean energy.
    The DRC's dynamic, entrepreneurial, and creative population 
of over 100 million are eager to engage with the United States.
    Our cooperation with the DRC has strengthened dramatically 
under the tenure of former Ambassador Mike Hammer. African 
Growth and Opportunity Act access has been reinstated.
    Through the Privileged Partnership for Peace, Prosperity, 
and Preservation of the Environment, we are broadening our 
engagement with President Tshisekedi's Government across the 
full range of issues to include security, democracy and human 
rights, anti-corruption, the environment, health, and business 
climate.
    If confirmed, I commit to nurturing and strengthening this 
ambitious agenda which is good both for the DRC and for the 
United States' health, economy, and the environment.
    In this continent sized country, U.S. assistance is helping 
tackle persistent health threats, notably Ebola, working to 
advance shared climate goals, and promoting responsible and 
accountable mineral supply chains.
    We are supporting efforts to fight the pervasive 
trafficking of persons, natural resources, and wildlife, which 
feeds corruption and violence.
    Other countries, notably the People's Republic of China, 
fully grasp the DRC's potential. We want the Congolese people 
to know that corrupt mineral exploitation deals, illegal 
logging, and environmental devastation is not inevitable and 
that there are alternatives.
    If confirmed, I commit to using all our diplomatic tools 
including leveraging visa ineligibilities and sanctions to help 
the Congolese fight corruption.
    Right now, reducing violence in the DRC's eastern region is 
critical. The region must not be allowed to stumble into 
another devastating interstate conflict.
    If confirmed, I will work closely with regional 
institutions and partners to deescalate tensions and pressure 
nonstate armed groups to stand down.
    The DRC is also home to the world's largest U.N. 
peacekeeping mission. This investment, of which the United 
States carries a quarter of the cost, must be held to the 
highest standards of performance and demonstrate its ability to 
protect civilians and conduct proactive operations against 
armed groups.
    I take this opportunity to express my condolences to the 
families of the three U.N. personnel killed in Butembo on July 
26.
    Finally, free and fair elections held in 2023 will be a 
particular focus of my diplomatic engagement, if confirmed. The 
future leaders of the DRC are for its citizens to decide, but 
the international community can play an important role in 
helping to strengthen democratic institutions, supporting civil 
society, and calling out without hesitation when we see signs 
of democratic backsliding.
    I recognize that, if confirmed, I will be assuming 
leadership of a post in a country of enormous size, complexity, 
and promise. The large portfolio of U.S. assistance requires 
astute direction, prioritization, and coordination. Chronic 
staffing shortages, a situation not unique to Kinshasa, need to 
be managed to ensure that we do not burn out and lose the next 
generation of Africa hands.
    Across all of these activities, I commit to ensuring the 
efficient and effective use of the resources entrusted to us by 
the U.S. taxpayer.
    I look forward to your advice and counsel on these 
challenging tasks and I am very happy to take your questions.
    Thank you.

    Senator Booker. Thank you for that important and

    We now are going to turn to Ms. Korhonen and your opening 
statement.
    Thank you.

 STATEMENT OF RACHNA SACHDEVA KORHONEN OF NEW JERSEY, A CAREER 
   MEMBER OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF COUNSELOR, 
NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF 
      THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI

    Ms. Korhonen. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, 
and distinguished members of the committee. I am honored to 
appear before you today as President Biden's nominee to be the 
next U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Mali. I appreciate the 
confidence he and Secretary Blinken have shown in me through 
this nomination.
    If confirmed, I look forward to working with you, other 
members of Congress, and staff to advance U.S. interests in 
Mali.
    Mr. Chairman, I joined the Foreign Service because of 9/11. 
That eventful day woke the need for service in me. I did not 
choose the Foreign Service. It chose me. It has taken me to 
India, Kuwait, Sri Lanka, Iraq, Saudi Arabia twice, and, if 
confirmed, hopefully, to Mali.
    A few months ago, Secretary Blinken appropriately observed 
that Mali remains a linchpin for future stability in the Sahel. 
We have deep concerns about that stability and deep concerns 
about the extremism and terrorism that is spreading tentacles 
in the region.
    This is, ultimately, about the people of Mali and their 
aspirations for peace, their aspirations for development, and 
respect for human rights. Security partnerships in Mali have 
shifted in the last year with the departure of European 
counterterrorism forces and the arrival of the Kremlin-backed 
Wagner Group. The human rights violations and abuses allegedly 
committed are not only horrific but will push aggrieved 
civilians into the ranks of terrorist groups.
    If confirmed, I will work to counter Russian disinformation 
attempts to veil the true harm and cost of Wagner's actions.
    Additionally, the United Nations' Multidimensional 
Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali--MINUSMA--is facing 
unprecedented challenges due to restrictions placed on it.
    I will advocate for the free movement of MINUSMA 
peacekeepers and for conditions that allow resumption of 
accountable international security assistance to counter the 
spread of terrorism across the country.
    If confirmed, I look forward to leading Embassy Bamako in 
advancing U.S. interests in Mali. Our main interests include 
bringing the country back to a constitutional democracy that 
helps all of its citizens, furthering economic development, and 
countering the incursion of terrorism that threatens not only 
Mali but the rest of the Sahel.
    We welcome the agreement to a 24-month timeline between the 
Economic Community of West African States--ECOWAS--and the 
transition government. If confirmed, I look forward to shaping 
U.S. activities to encourage constructive participation in 
Mali's democratic transition and 2024 elections.
    Malians have shown before that they can be the shining 
light of the region. U.S. assistance in Mali promotes democracy 
and improves governance while supporting sustainable 
livelihoods. USAID's health programs reach 80 percent of Mali's 
population--80 percent.
    NIH, CDC, have built solid public health systems that met 
the Ebola challenge in the past, helped mitigate the impact of 
COVID, and promise to make inroads in the global fight against 
malaria.
    These programs are closely integrated with our democracy 
and counterterrorism goals in a well coordinated interagency 
effort.
    If confirmed, I will work together with our interagency and 
our international partners to maintain strong partnerships for 
development and stability. We are committed to the Malian 
people and their aspiration for responsive democratic 
governance.
    Mr. Chairman, if confirmed, my highest priority will be the 
protection of Americans and American interests, including all 
mission personnel.
    Moreover, I will carefully and diligently ensure 
responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars through effective 
leadership of U.S. Embassy Bamako's strong interagency team.
    Mr. Chairman, you see sitting before you the ultimate 
American dream. I am a proud immigrant girl from New Jersey who 
has had the good fortune to be nominated to represent the best 
country on Earth.
    So much of who I am belongs to my parents, Paul and Meena 
Sachdeva. Dad is watching me from New Jersey. Mom is right 
behind me. I wish my grandfather was alive. He would have been 
so proud.
    But the most important person in my life is my husband, 
Juha, also sitting behind me. I would not be here today without 
him. He and our three children--Varun, Vicram, both of whom are 
here, and Veera, who is hanging out somewhere in Europe, are 
what really make my life worth living.
    I am deeply grateful to them for their support and their 
love. I could not have done this without them.
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member and members of the committee, 
if confirmed, I look forward to working closely with all of you 
and would hope to welcome you to Bamako during my tenure.
    Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. I 
welcome your questions.

    Mr. Chairman, if confirmed, my highest priority will be the 
protection of Americans and American interests, including Mission 
personnel. Moreover, I will carefully and diligently ensure responsible 
stewardship of taxpayer dollars through effective leadership of U.S. 
Embassy Bamako's strong interagency team.
    Mr. Chairman, you see sitting before you the ultimate American 
dream. I am a proud immigrant girl from New Jersey who has had the good 
fortune to be nominated to represent these United States. So much of 
who I am belongs to my parents Paul and Meena Sachdeva. I wish my 
grandfather were alive; he would have been so proud. But the most 
important person in my life is sitting behind me, my husband, Juha. I 
would not be here today without him. He and our three children, Varun, 
Vicram, and Veera are what make life worth living. I am deeply grateful 
to them for their support and love.
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the committee, if 
confirmed, I look forward to working closely with all of you and would 
hope to welcome you to Bamako during my tenure. Thank you for the 
opportunity to appear before you today. I welcome your questions.


    Senator Booker. Thank you for, frankly, that inspiring 
opening statement about your life and your appreciation of the 
gravity of the work that you are doing.
    Mr. Schiffer, we are turning to you. This could be a very 
brutal hearing for you because, as I learned from studying the 
Gospels, you are really not appreciated when you come home.
    So if you would like to try to do anything you can to 
prepare the ground for what--the tilling that might happen 
after your opening statement, you may go ahead.
    [Laughter.]

 STATEMENT OF ROLFE MICHAEL SCHIFFER OF NEW YORK, NOMINATED TO 
 BE AN ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR OF THE UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR 
                   INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

    Mr. Schiffer. I am not entirely sure how to follow up on 
that, Mr. Chairman. I am wondering if I can get under the table 
as opposed to be sitting here on this side of the dais.
    But my thanks to you, my thanks to Ranking Member Rounds. 
It is, indeed, a much less pleasant experience being on this 
side than where I am used to sitting behind all of you. But, 
hopefully, I will manage to survive.
    I am deeply humbled to be coming before this committee 
today to serve as the nominee as Assistant Administrator of the 
Asia Bureau at USAID and I am deeply humbled also by the trust 
placed in me by President Biden and Administrator Power.
    If confirmed, I will seek to contribute to USAID's efforts 
to build an enduring U.S. diplomatic and development presence 
in the Indo-Pacific, the most strategically vital region of the 
globe, and I am honored to be here today seeking your trust to 
join with the dedicated staff of USAID to undertake this 
important work on behalf of the American people.
    I am joined today by my former wife and friend, Wendy 
Wasserman, and my daughter, Josie. Josie's support and 
encouragement and all that she has had to put up with over the 
years, including this right now, means everything to me.
    My partner, Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, and her son are not 
able to join me today. But Stephanie's wisdom has contributed 
much to making me capable of seeking your advice and consent to 
undertake this task and I owe her a debt which can never be 
repaid.
    So, too, my mother and sister, and my father, who is no 
longer with us, but whose ethical teachings and moral guidance 
have long been my lodestar.
    I also want to express my appreciation and support for 
Chairman Menendez and all that he has provided me with over the 
years. His tireless commitment to building a nation in a world 
consistent with our highest values and aspirations, especially 
at times when those values have been uniquely stressed both at 
home and abroad, has been nothing short of inspirational.
    And last but, certainly, not least, I want to express my 
thanks to all the members and the staff of this committee. You 
all know how strongly I feel about the work that you all do, 
that we all do--I think I can still say that--and how torn I am 
to leave.
    If confirmed, I pledge that I will work with you in genuine 
consultation and partnership and I trust that you will keep me 
honest should I falter in that pledge.
    As we face the challenges of the 21st century, including 
the realities of strategic competition with China, I can think 
of few undertakings more important than extending USAID's 
mission to drive sustainable and inclusive development, 
regional prosperity, and stability in Asia.
    It is central to our national interest to help meet the 
region's humanitarian needs, contribute to free and open 
regional architecture, and to work with the people and 
governments of the region to safeguard their sovereignty, build 
vital civil societies, and to promote democratic governance, 
confront human rights violations, and to combat gender 
inequality, corruption, and kleptocracy.
    And, as I know members of this committee appreciate, we do 
this work not just because it is the right thing to do, 
although it is certainly that, but because working alongside 
allies and partners in the region to build a more capable and 
connected Indo-Pacific community is vital for America and 
benefits American workers and families.
    As the President's Indo-Pacific strategy states, the United 
States has long recognized the Indo-Pacific as vital to our 
security and prosperity, and we have pursued partnership in the 
region since our very founding as a nation.
    There is no shortage of challenges in the region. Climate 
change poses an existential threat across Asia, from Pacific 
islands threatened with rising tides to the fragile ecosystem 
of the Tibetan Plateau.
    More than 300 million still live in extreme poverty and 
food insecurity threatens the lives and livelihoods of 
millions. Unmet basic education and health care needs, 
democratic backsliding, and immense infrastructure requirements 
are just a few of the challenges the region faces.
    But just as there is no shortage of challenges so, too, 
there is no shortage of opportunities to foster deeper local 
partnerships, greater innovation through localization, and more 
meaningful results to drive development progress, not simply 
development programs.
    If confirmed, I look forward to pursuing opportunities to 
work with our partners, particularly in the Pacific, on climate 
adaptation, disaster preparedness and resilience, and a 
sustainable future, as well as opportunities to enable high-
quality development finance and public-private partnerships to 
further the President's Partnership for Global Infrastructure 
and Investment.
    Equally important will be furthering good governance, anti-
corruption, human rights, and supporting civil society actors 
in the region. We can do this by building deeper relationships 
with our development partners, including the Quad, so that 
together we are more efficient and effective in meeting 
regional needs.
    Likewise, we can strengthen our work with our ASEAN 
partners to build real functional problem-solving architecture.
    Thank you all for the opportunity to appear before you 
today and for your consideration of my nomination. I look 
forward to any questions you may have.

    Senator Booker. We are grateful for that opening testimony.
    We are going to now turn to Mr. Fick for his opening 
testimony.

     STATEMENT OF NATHANIEL FICK OF MAINE, NOMINATED TO BE 
     AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE FOR CYBERSPACE AND DIGITAL POLICY

    Mr. Fick. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and distinguished 
committee members, I am honored to appear before you today as 
nominee to be the first ever U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for 
Cyberspace and Digital Policy.
    Joining me behind me, both physically and metaphorically, 
are my wife, Margaret, and our daughters, Ella and Kate. They 
are constant proof for me that, despite the digital world's 
importance, life's true rewards are found right here in the 
physical one.
    My parents, Neil and Jane, are watching from Maine. They 
instilled in me a strong sense of family, of integrity, and of 
public service.
    I feel as if all the threads of my professional life come 
together in this role, from combat service as a Marine Corps 
infantry officer, to leading a national security research 
organization, to building and leading a cybersecurity software 
company.
    American technology leadership is critical to the credible 
promotion of our values, to sustaining our economic strength, 
and to our national security. It is the next frontier of 
American diplomacy.
    Our future will be shaped by the infrastructure, standards, 
norms, and policies that determine how digital technologies are 
developed, deployed, and used. We are in a global contest for a 
democratic future in which we can all use technology to reach 
our full potential and against an authoritarian future in which 
technology is harnessed to repress free expression and 
destabilize open democratic societies.
    Countries such as the People's Republic of China and Russia 
have a very different vision for cyberspace and the use of 
digital technologies, which is why American leadership matters 
in this arena alongside like-minded allies and partners.
    Recognizing this context and building on the ongoing work 
of the Department, Secretary Blinken established the Bureau of 
Cyberspace and Digital Policy earlier this year with the strong 
bipartisan support of this committee and others.
    If confirmed, I pledge to partner with the committee and 
with all of Congress to further elevate and integrate cyber and 
digital policy in U.S. diplomacy and diplomacy in U.S. cyber 
and digital policy.
    There are three key areas where, if confirmed, I would 
partner with the committee to make progress.
    First, we must strengthen adherence to the framework of 
responsible state behavior that all U.N. member states have 
endorsed. This framework affirms that international law applies 
to state conduct in cyberspace and lays out norms that, 
although voluntary and nonbinding, guide what states should and 
should not do in cyberspace.
    And yet, norms are more effective in binding together our 
allies than they are in dissuading our adversaries. To reduce 
the frequency and severity of damaging cyber incidents, we must 
collaborate across the U.S. Government and with partners around 
the world to deter malicious cyber activity and impose 
meaningful consequences on states that engage in it and those 
that willfully harbor cyber criminal organizations.
    Second, we must promote a global digital economy that lets 
U.S. companies and their workers compete on an equal playing 
field around the world. This includes preserving the free flow 
of data across international borders while protecting users' 
privacy and the confidentiality and integrity of the data.
    We must support open transparent standards in the multi-
stakeholder model of Internet governance that has enabled 
decades of innovation, and we must promote new innovations, 
such as Open Radio Access Networks, and work to ensure the 
security of the entire telecommunications ecosystem upon which 
we all rely.
    Third, we must at every turn champion a positive vision for 
digital freedom and digital inclusion while working to combat 
digital authoritarianism. This means partnering with civil 
society, the private sector, and other governments to 
understand how digital technologies can help people exercise 
their human rights and reach their full potential.
    We must harness these technologies to strengthen democratic 
governance instead of allowing them to be used for repression. 
I approach each of these missions with great respect for the 
dedicated public servants at the Department of State, who have 
ably championed U.S. interests as cyber and digital issues have 
become a foreign policy imperative.
    If confirmed, I will dedicate my time and energy to 
building the new bureau into an enduring institution with the 
talent and resources it needs to advance U.S. interests around 
the world through diplomatic engagement and foreign assistance.
    I appreciate the trust President Biden and Secretary 
Blinken have expressed in asking me to serve in this new role.
    I thank you for the opportunity to be here today and I look 
forward to your questions.

                 Prepared Statement for Nathaniel Fick

    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and distinguished committee members, 
I am honored to appear before you today as nominee to be the first-ever 
U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Cyberspace and Digital Policy. Thank you 
for considering my nomination.
    Joining me here are my wife, Margaret Angell, and our daughters, 
Ella, and Kate. They are constant proof for me that, despite the 
digital world's importance, life's true rewards are found in the 
physical one.
    I feel as if all the threads of my professional background--from 
combat service as a Marine Corps infantry officer, to leadership of the 
Center for a New American Security, to building and leading a 
cybersecurity software company--come together in this role.
    American technology leadership is critical to the credible 
promotion of our values, to sustaining our economic strength, and to 
safeguarding our national security. It is the next frontier of American

that has the expertise and experience to advance national security, 
economic prosperity, and human rights in this digital age.
    There are three key areas where, if confirmed, I would partner with

potential. We must harness these technologies to strengthen democratic 
governance instead of allowing them to be used for repression. We must 
help more people--including those coming online for the first time--
build resilience to threats they may face, including abuse or foreign 
influence operations.

dedicated public servants who work at the Department of State who have

expressed in asking me to serve in this new role, one so important for 
the future of the American people and our shared global future. I thank 
you for the opportunity to be here today and I look forward to your 
questions.


    Senator Booker. Mr. Fick, we thank you so much for your 
opening statement. I would like to, without any objection from 
my ranking member, to defer to Senator Menendez for his opening 
round of questions.
    Then we are going to come back to the ranking member. Then 
we are going to proceed to Senator Kaine. I am going to be here 
for the duration so I can save my questions for last, depending 
on who shows up.
    And with that, I would like to turn to my senior senator, 
senior to me in time in the Senate but also senior to me in 
sagacity, tenacity, and audacity.
    [Laughter.]

               STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY

    The Chairman. Okay. I am going to record these comments.
    Anyhow, let me thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the ranking 
member for presiding over this nomination hearing. One of the 
most important things we do as members of the committee is 
oversee nominations and we need the help of all of our 
colleagues in getting through the nominees.
    I appreciate both you and the ranking member for doing it 
and thank you for the courtesy of being able to go first. I 
have some other issues.
    Congratulations to the nominees before us today. We thank 
you and all of your families for your service to our country.
    Let me take a few minutes of personal privilege to speak 
about Michael Schiffer, who has been my longtime senior advisor 
and counselor on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
    He is one of the leading foreign policy minds in 
Washington, having also served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for East Asia. He is a respected expert on Asia with a 
network of relationships across the continent.
    I never forgot when I first started visiting Asia when I 
was on the committee in 2006 and started going with Michael to 
visit Asia, and it would be very interesting to me when heads 
of state, including when I was chairman of the committee 
previously, would say hello, Mr. Schiffer, before they would 
say hello to me. So it just goes to the depth of relationships 
he has.
    I have long relied on Michael's counsel, expertise, and 
judgment and dealing with some of the most vexing issues facing 
the committee, and no one is more qualified or more deserving 
of this nomination than he is.
    He is dedicated and committed to a values-based foreign 
policy that champions freedom, human rights, and democracy, and 
he will be a strong advocate for those principles across the 
continent and will work to ensure that AID's programming 
reflect our values and our interests.
    And he is someone who does not hesitate to speak his mind. 
Stories about his willingness to speak truth to power abound. 
But do not worry, Michael, I will not share them here today.
    But it is an important quality that will serve him well in 
the executive branch as he ensures that USAID has a seat at the 
table and a voice in the interagency process. It is precisely 
that kind of leadership that we need in the Administration 
today, someone that knows the right approach on assistance to 
Asia and how to get it there.
    So I appreciate all of those great assets and I will not 
continue with my remarks on you because then my time will be 
eaten up for questions. So I will include them for the record.
    Michael, thank you for your excellent work with us.
    Mr. Fick, to be the Ambassador-at-Large for Cyberspace and 
Digital Diplomacy is the new frontier for us. The State 
Department unveiled the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital 
Diplomacy in April this year.
    Last week, the committee introduced the State Department 
authorization of 2022 which contains a version of the Cyber 
Diplomacy Act that would authorize the CDP bureau in statute 
and thus support its long-term viability.
    What would be your top priorities as Ambassador-at-Large 
for the bureau as it finds its footing in the department?
    Mr. Fick. Thank you, Senator, for the question and also for 
having me here today.
    I have three immediate top priorities and I think of them 
as concentric rings moving from innermost to outermost. Because 
the bureau is new, the first and innermost priority is building 
the team and establishing a culture both in the bureau and in 
the Department where a fluency and expertise in digital 
technologies is seen as important to the careers and futures of 
career Foreign Service Officers and members of the civil 
service.
    I can imagine a future where any candidate to be a chief of 
mission is expected to have an understanding of these issues 
because they are a substrate that cut across every aspect of 
our foreign policy.
    The second priority,this second ring, moving outward, is to 
assert the State Department's rightful place in the interagency 
process on topics of cybersecurity and digital policy.
    And then third are all the policy challenges out there in 
the world. The wolf closest to the door, so to speak, in my 
view, is the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the threats and 
opportunities it provides in the digital space for us; and then 
I believe our strategic competition with China along digital 
lines is probably the defining strategic question of my 
generation.
    The Chairman. I am glad to hear you say about making sure 
that the equities of the State Department at the table in the 
interagency process are owned because, from my perspective, 
sometimes the State Department does not get its due as it 
relates to its critical role in the context of the interagency 
process. So that will be an important one.
    And I hope that you will, upon confirmation, create a 
productive relationship with this committee. This committee has 
members that are very interested in this domain and want to 
engage with you in the days ahead.
    Mr. Fick. I commit to that, sir.
    The Chairman.  And if I may, Mr. Chairman, one other 
question.
    Ms. Korhonen--did I pronounce it correctly? Okay.
    The Trans-Sahel Counterterrorism Partnership Program Act of 
2021, which is law, which I sponsored, not only calls for a 
strategy for the Sahel, it calls for a specific strategy for 
Mali as part of the overall approach.
    We had a hearing where representatives from State, DOD, and 
USAID shared the Administration's approach, and as I mentioned 
at that time we look to have input into the strategy as a 
result of that hearing.
    Could you briefly outline for me the draft five-year 
strategy for Mali? How does that strategy differ from the 
approach of previous Administrations with respect to balancing 
the so-called three Ds in Mali?
    Ms. Korhonen. Thank you. I have not seen a five-year 
strategy for Mali.
    I, however, do know that the department and our interagency 
partners are working together on multiple issues in Mali and I 
would say that, if confirmed, my priorities will be that we 
help and support the transition government to come to 
democratic governance, to elections that they promised with 
ECOWAS in March 2024. Really happy to see that deadline.
    I also know that this--just this past Sunday, the Algerian 
President Tebboune called for the Malian transition government 
to hold elections and, in fact, on Monday there was a meeting--
a decisional meeting for the Algiers Accord.
    So I would say elections, transition to democratic 
governance, working through the Algerian Peace Accords, support 
of MINUSMA is--are the things that I would really be looking at 
in terms of what should be happening in Mali in the next five 
years.
    I believe that is kind of where the department is going at 
this point.
    The Chairman.  We look forward to working with you because 
the law that we authored, ultimately, seeks to create a clear 
vision of where we go and a strategy to achieve it versus 
working ad hoc.
    Mr. Chairman, thank you for the courtesy. I have questions 
for all of the nominees. I am going to submit them for the 
record in deference to my colleagues.
    I would ask you to give me substantive answers. If you do, 
then you will advance to a business meeting. If you do not, we 
are going to have to wait for the substantive answers.
    So I do hope you will give me substantive answers to the 
questions that we will propound to you and, again, 
congratulations to all of you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Booker. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Ranking Member?
    Senator Rounds. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Once again, it is good to see the qualifications of the 
members in front of us here at this time.
    Mr. Fick, the deployment of secure fifth-generation, or 5G, 
networks is critical not only for U.S. networks but throughout 
the world with our allies and partners. Meanwhile, countries 
like China pose a serious threat to our foreign allies and 
partners through companies such as Huawei.
    The fiscal year '21 NDAA established a multilateral 
telecommunications security fund executed by the Secretary of 
State to support the development and adoption of secure and 
trusted telecommunications technologies with our partners and 
allies. Appropriations for this fund were passed as part of the 
CHIPS legislation last week.
    If confirmed, how do you plan to use this fund to work with 
our partners and allies to develop secure and trusted 
alternatives to Huawei and how will you leverage this fund to 
encourage development of innovative new technologies like Open 
Radio Access Networks known as ORAN?
    Mr. Fick. Thank you, Senator.
    I strongly share the sentiment expressed in your question 
and believe very strongly that global telecom security is 
essential. I believe that the U.S. cannot do it alone. By its 
very nature this is a global network of hardware and 
infrastructure and, if confirmed, I would work to deploy the 
resources appropriated in the CHIPS Act.
    I think from my seat still on the outside looking in I 
applaud the passage of the Act. Two particular examples for 
consideration might be partnering with the European Commission 
under the Trade and Technology Council in order to finance the 
deployment of secure infrastructure to third countries. That is 
something that I would very quickly want to explore.
    Another example would be expanding work with the Quad 
countries in order to promote Open RAN deployments in the Indo-
Pacific, and you have my commitment that I would engage with 
the committee and with Congress before and during any 
implementation.
    Senator Rounds. Very good. Thank you.
    Ms. Korhonen, just last week the State Department ordered 
the departure of nonemergency U.S. Government personnel from 
Mali due to heightened risk of terrorist attacks.
    Regardless of how long this ordered departure persists, if 
confirmed, you will serve as chief of mission at a high risk 
post for U.S. personnel. How will you approach your role as 
chief of mission in this environment where, despite significant 
challenges, the staff of the U.S. embassy have important work 
to do?
    Ms. Korhonen. Thank you, sir.
    My first priority absolutely will be the safety and 
security of American citizens and mission personnel.
    The attack on July 22nd was just about 10 miles from the 
embassy. The situation is serious and we must proceed with an 
abundance of caution.
    I believe my experiences in serving--in the past serving at 
high threat posts will serve me well, if I am confirmed. I also 
understand that Mission Bamako enjoys high morale and, if 
confirmed, it will be my goal to sustain that positive work and 
life experience while we navigate Mali's myriad challenges 
together.
    Thank you.
    Senator Rounds. Thank you.
    Ambassador Tamlyn, what is your view on the prospects for 
credible elections in DRC next year?
    Ms. Tamlyn. Thank you, sir.
    The Congolese have the right to free, fair, and on time 
elections and they want that, and we know that the path to a 
more prosperous and stable DRC lies through a good election and 
a consolidation of their democratic experience.
    It is a country with immense challenges because of its size 
and the logistics that are needed. The institutions, we know, 
are weak. If confirmed, one of my highest priorities would be 
to immediately review the planning that is underway to prepare 
ourselves and the country for elections and there are three 
things in particular that we need to look at.
    The first is progress on national preparations--how are 
they doing in terms of voter rolls, procurement, and the census 
that may need to take place.
    The second thing is how is our assistance helping in the 
right places, and then, finally, what is the enabling 
environment. You cannot have a credible election if there is 
not an even playing field for all of the candidates and if 
rights of freedom of assembly or freedom of expression are not 
fully supported.
    Finally, a credible election does not just happen 
overnight. It is something that you need to be preparing for, 
and planning for, for a good period of time in advance and that 
includes messaging to the Government clearly what our 
expectations are.
    So I hope to be able to do that and also work closely with 
international partners so their messaging is strong and 
consistent across the board.
    Senator Rounds. Thank you.
    Mr. Chairman, I do have questions for the other nominees, 
but in the interests of allowing our other members to move 
forward I think I will defer them and allow the other members 
to ask questions first.
    Senator Booker. I recognize Senator Kaine.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Senator 
Rounds.
    I could ask questions for about an hour of this panel 
because I think I could learn a tremendous amount. But let me 
make two comments and then, really, one question that will be 
for you, Ambassador Tamlyn.
    First, to Nathaniel Fick, when my son, Nathaniel, was a 
senior in high school in December of 2007 and came to me and 
said, Mom and Dad, I want you to know that I have been talking 
to a Marine recruiter for the last few months, I noticed that 
he had your book ``One Bullet Away'' on his bookshelf, and I 
think--it was a surprise to us when he told us this--I think 
your writing was influential in his decision.
    He had an eight-year career as a infantry officer with two 
deployments, is now a reservist. But I just wanted to say you 
have influenced a lot of people in a lot of your previous 
capacities, but that book in particular, and maybe just--maybe 
even the Nathaniel coincidence was one--helped create a really 
talented Marine officer in my oldest son.
    Mr. Fick. Thank you, sir.
    Senator Kaine. And then, Mr. Schiffer, I will just say it 
is really a treat to see you back. You performed such good 
service during my time on this committee and you are so well 
suited for the position.
    Ambassador Tamlyn, I am going to take my questions to you 
in a completely different direction because I feel like the 
five of you are very qualified for the positions that you are 
going to be going to and I am going to support you all.
    But when we have foreign relations folks who are posted in 
countries right now that I am concerned about, I often ask 
about your current post rather than the one to which you will 
be nominated and I am very, very worried about Sudan and I 
think I am going to just talk to you a little bit about that.
    The reports just within the last few days from CNN that 
Sudanese gold has been plundered by Russians to support the 
Ukrainian war has led to street protests in Sudan, and I am 
interested that the Sudanese Government has reacted to these 
reports by cracking down on plunderers? No. Cracking down on 
those who revealed the information that demonstrated that 
Russia was plundering their gold reserves.
    What do you think this very shocking reporting portends for 
Sudan and what advice would you have for the committee about 
the way we should approach the U.S.-Sudanese relationship, 
given the significant number of challenges in Sudan right now?
    Ms. Tamlyn. Thank you, Senator.
    I think that the path ahead to deal with this and other 
issues is supporting a civilian-led transitional government.
    What we have seen following the revolution is that only a 
civilian-led government is capable of tackling these issues, of 
bringing transparency to bear on the events happening in the 
country, putting in place more responsible government 
institutions, and thinking about these issues and trying to 
figure out a better way of doing them.
    So that is our major focus right now. We are working very 
closely with all of the stakeholders involved to support a 
civilian-led transitional government, and what we have made 
clear as well is that until there is a credible civilian-led 
transitional government that has the broad support of the 
Sudanese people, U.S. assistance will not be available.
    Senator Kaine. The reporting is just a few days old and, 
again, it is really shocking. I would encourage all my 
colleagues to read it--I mentioned many have--and I applaud CNN 
for doing such good work on it.
    Do you think thus far the reaction in Sudan of the public 
would suggest that it would increase the public demand for a 
stable civilian government that could, hopefully, avoid just 
shocking malfeasance of the kind that has been reported?
    Ms. Tamlyn. There is no debating this issue. I would say 
about 100 percent of the Sudanese population seek a civilian-
led government. There is very clear consensus across the board 
for many reasons but including this one because I think there 
is a great concern about the natural resources of the country 
not being used for the benefit of the people.
    I think it simply underscores the importance of moving 
swiftly forward on this transition.
    Thank you.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you. With that, I yield back, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Senator Booker. I am grateful for that yielding of about a 
minute of your time. I am sure Senator Portman respects that 
tremendously.
    Senator Portman. Yes.
    Senator Booker. Sir, we yield to you now for your 
questions.
    Senator Portman. It is a good model to emulate.
    Senator Booker. Yes.
    Senator Portman. First of all, I want to thank Chairman 
Booker and Ranking Member Rounds for holding this hearing, and 
I know that these nominees have all served their country 
already but I want to thank you for stepping up to serve again.
    And with regard to Africa, enormous potential often 
overlooked, and so for our nominees heading to African 
countries we need your U.S. presence there.
    I am heading to Africa, to east Africa mostly, with Senator 
Coons in a couple of weeks and we look forward to that visit. 
But there are so many questions I could ask about that.
    But I am going to focus on something else, which is Mr. 
Fick and, again, appreciate your service including in the 
Marine Corps.
    What I am concerned about is that we have overlapping 
responsibilities and authorities with regard to our cyber 
defense and this has been something I have worked on for a 
while with very little result, actually.
    We seem to keep adding more and more top cybersecurity 
positions to our Government and the org chart troubles me. More 
importantly, what troubles me is that without accountability I 
am worried that things will happen and it is too easy to point 
fingers. As we saw after the Colonial Pipeline incident, you 
probably recall, everyone was pointing fingers.
    So we have this top position of the deputy national 
security adviser for cyber already, which is obviously 
international in orientation. We have the federal CISO, of 
course, at OMB. We have the National Cyber Directorate, which 
was established by this Congress after a commission report that 
indicated we needed a national director.
    We have the CISA director at Department of Homeland 
Security. One could argue that we also have at every agency and 
department others but, in effect, they are reporting up at 
least to somebody.
    But your position that you are being nominated for is a new 
one and I think it overlaps with the Office of the National 
Cyber Director. The legislation says that that director ``shall 
serve as the principal advisor to the President relating to 
coordination of diplomatic and other efforts to develop norms 
and international consensus around responsible state behavior 
in cyberspace,'' end quote.
    So I just want to know from you, one, are you sensitive to 
this issue and aware of it. And, again, as someone with a 
military background, I imagine you share some of my concerns 
and I would like to hear those if you do and how you intend to 
conduct yourself in this role so that you can fit into this 
construct.
    Congress is not very good at org charts so it really will 
be the responsibility of the individuals who have these jobs to 
work together and to not allow the gaps in accountability, in 
particular, with regard to the National Cyber Director's role, 
which seems to overlap directly with the State Department Cyber 
and Digital Policy Bureau functions, responsibilities.
    How would you work collaboratively across all departments 
to assure that we are not being duplicative and ensure that we 
have accountability?
    Mr. Fick. Thank you, Senator. I appreciate the question and 
the sentiment behind it.
    I think in addition to my military experience, my 
experience building and leading a business instilled in me an 
appreciation for a clear chain of command and appreciation for 
clear and well defined swim lanes, an appreciation for 
accountability, and kind of a wry sense that it is always easy 
to add but it is hard to subtract, and so I come to this role 
with a heightened sense of concern about the issue that you 
raise.
    And that said, I have had--I have a strong conviction that 
this role actually fills a gap that has existed in our 
Government.
    When I was leading a business and working with the 
Government in this space, CISA has a strong presence here. The 
White House has a strong presence here. The Defense Department 
has a strong presence here, and the State Department has not, 
and I believe that diplomacy should be our tool of first 
resort. I believe in the intrinsic value of diplomacy.
    And so I think this role actually does fill an important 
gap in the cyber and tech responsibilities across the 
Government. I have known Director Inglis and Anne Neuberger and 
Jen Easterly in different capacities for more than a decade.
    I have full confidence that we can carve out the right swim 
lanes and I hope that as the--if confirmed as the inaugural 
ambassador leading this office, we could create clear lines of 
responsibility that outlive any individual.
    Senator Portman. Thank you. I appreciate the fact you 
recognize the overlap and the potential conflicts and most 
importantly, again, just the notion that accountability is 
necessary for us to be sure we are covering our bases with 
regard to this growing threat that we face as a country.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Booker. We are going to go now to Senator Cardin.
    Senator Cardin. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I 
appreciate it. I also appreciate the manner in which you 
conduct this hearing.
    Senator Booker. I am very grateful for that, sir.
    Senator Cardin. I am glad that you are grateful.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Cardin. Let me also acknowledge what Senator Rounds 
indicated during his opening comments that all five of our 
nominees have a career of public service and you have dedicated 
yourselves to helping our country.
    We know that is a family sacrifice and we thank you and 
your families for your incredible service to our nation, and we 
are very pleased that you are willing to take on these 
incredibly important responsibilities, in one case a new 
position, in other cases some critically important countries, 
and the position at USAID.
    Mr. Schiffer, as I said earlier as you were being eulogized 
by our chairman because you are leaving us--that is the 
reason--your service here was incredible. I thank you very 
much. I enjoyed all of our opportunities together and you have 
some real challenges at USAID, and I want to talk a little bit 
about Burma, if I might.
    It is a tragic situation. The current government there and 
its--the human rights records are horrible. So how do we help 
the people who have been victimized by what has happened in 
Burma?
    How does the United States play a constructive role to try 
to get help out to the people that have been dislocated and 
abused as a result of Burmese Government?
    Mr. Schiffer. Senator Cardin, thank you for your kind 
comments and let me also thank you for your leadership on Burma 
over the years.
    I share, as you know, your sense in the tragedy that has 
befallen that country since the coup in 2021 and the challenges 
that we have in Burma right now.
    I think it is absolutely vital that the United States 
stands with the people of Burma and that we do all that we can, 
working with our partners in the region--our ASEAN partners--to 
assure that there is humanitarian access so that we can provide 
assistance to those who are in the country as well as to 
provide assistance, whether it is shelter, nutritional 
assistance, food assistance, educational opportunities, to 
those that have been displaced to camps either in Thailand or 
in Bangladesh. I think there is a deep moral obligation.
    And then, secondly, I think we have a continued obligation 
to work with civil society actors who remain in Burma who are 
trying valiantly to create additional space so that democracy 
and genuine ethnic and national reconciliation might once again 
get traction in that country, and to work with them to try to 
lead Burma back to a path of democracy and responsible 
governance.
    I have no illusions about how tough it is. I have no 
illusions about the challenges that we face with the military 
junta in Naypyidaw.
    But this is important work and, if confirmed, it is one of 
the issues I intend to throw myself into.
    Senator Cardin. Thank you.
    Ms. Tamlyn, I want to talk a little bit about DRC. There 
has been, obviously, a challenge in the past. The Government 
appears to want to make a commitment to fight corruption and I 
would be interested as to how we can assist in that regard.
    They also have an election coming up in 2023 that we would 
like to see how we could be--assist to make sure that is a free 
and fair election.
    So just tell me your strategies and commitment to the human 
rights agenda and the democracy agenda to assist in regards to 
what is necessary to fight corruption and to ensure that we 
have free and fair elections, the best that we can in that 
country.
    Ms. Tamlyn. Thank you, Senator.
    Those would, certainly, be among my highest priorities if 
confirmed, because we know that human rights abuses and 
corruption actually eat away at any prospects for the DRC to 
emerge as a prosperous and stable country. So it is in their 
interests and it also has to be the sine qua non of our 
partnership with them that they are making progress on that.
    Through what we call the Privileged Partnership for Peace, 
Prosperity, and Preservation of the Environment, which is kind 
of a portmanteau for a lot of activities that are undergoing, 
we have a strong human rights and democracy component and we 
also, of course, are working to support the elections.
    I just mentioned a couple of things that we are doing. But 
let me note that after the last elections we did not fail to 
call out actors who had been engaged in corrupt practices and 
undermining the elections, and I think that that stands out as 
quite the warning, and we, certainly, need to make sure that we 
keep those tools ready if we see the same kind of circumstances 
repeating themselves as far as corruption or bad actors that 
threaten the integrity of the elections.
    And similarly, on human rights and corruption we need to 
hold the leaders accountable for that and I think that is 
something that, if confirmed, would be part of my dialogue with 
leaders of the country to make sure that they understand how it 
is not just a question of words but actions in terms of 
addressing problems of corruption whether it is in the military 
or in other parts of the Government.
    Thank you.
    Senator Cardin. I agree. You have our support here in the 
Senate to amplify those issues, particularly if we believe that 
attention is needed in order to get the right results. So thank 
you.
    Ms. Tamlyn. Thank you.
    Senator Cardin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Booker. We thank the stalwart senator from Maryland 
and now we move to the one senator in the entire United States 
Senate who is, indeed, forever young.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Young. With apologies to Rod Stewart, thank you, 
Chairman.
    Mr. Fick, last year I introduced legislation with Senator 
Warner and the Chairman of this committee that would establish 
an interagency tech partnership office housed at the State 
Department.
    This office would spearhead the United States' global 
efforts to forge robust technology partnerships with like-
minded partners and allies with a special focus on norms and 
standards, joint research, and export controls and investment 
screens.
    I believe that if America is to truly compete and exceed 
the Chinese Communist Party's whole-of-government approach to 
tech domination we must harness all the tools of allies and 
partners and work together.
    Consistent with the bipartisan vision of the CHIPS and 
Science Act, which just passed Congress and the President of 
the United States will sign into law in a few weeks, we are 
trying to formalize this effort to crowd in the talent and 
treasure of other countries in co-developing technologies so 
that we can have common standards and really marshal all of the 
collective wherewithal that we have as we think about this 
generational competition with the CCP.
    Do you believe that the State Department is best positioned 
within the federal government to lead creation of this 
interagency tech partnership office? Does the State Department 
have the resources and the ability to harness the necessary 
expertise within State and beyond to spearhead this effort?
    Mr. Fick. Thank you, Senator.
    I do believe that the State Department as the nation's lead 
foreign policy agency should lead on the partnership aspects of 
technology collaboration.
    I appreciate also that this is a cross cutting issue 
inherently. It has defense elements, it has intelligence 
elements, it has economic elements, et cetera. And so I would 
not expect these efforts to sit exclusively in the State 
Department.
    But I do think as far as partnerships go the State 
Department is properly positioned to lead and I think--I 
believe that the creation of this role helps to elevate and 
integrate those functions at the State Department, and if I am 
confirmed I would welcome the opportunity to work with you on 
this vision. I share a strong sense of its importance and do 
not believe that we can do it alone.
    Senator Young. Thank you for that. I would look forward to 
that opportunity, sir.
    I have also noted with great interest the conclusions of 
the report of the independent task force that you co-chaired 
for the Council on Foreign Relations, ``Confronting Reality in 
Cyberspace.'' The report calls for more cohesive links between 
our national security strategy and our policy for digital 
competition.
    Could you comment on where the U.S. can make meaningful 
progress on this aspect of our foreign policy and where you 
envision your role to be in making that policy and implementing 
it, if confirmed?
    Mr. Fick. Yes, Senator.
    As I said in my opening statement, I believe that 
technology is the next frontier of diplomacy. I believe that 
diplomacy is our tool of first resort in international 
relations, and so by extension I think that this is a cross-
cutting substrate that is part of every aspect of our national 
security strategy and foreign policy.
    And so my hope, if confirmed in this role, is to provide 
kindkind of coherence to our tech diplomacy and ensure that we 
as a government first,and we as a leader of like-minded allies 
and partners are coordinating our efforts because we have a 
competitor out there with a very different vision of what our 
global technology future should look like. I look behind me 
here at my children and think that this is fundamental to 
shaping the world that they will grow up in.
    Senator Young. Thank you, sir. Got some mic issues here.
    And, lastly, I will just ask you and if you can answer in 
fairly short order, going back to the report I referenced, in 
lieu of sanctions what tools are available to the United States 
to strengthen adherence to a framework of responsible state 
behavior in cyberspace?
    Mr. Fick. Senator, I believe that we have not fully 
extended deterrence into the cyber domain. I believe that 
American power has been a force for stability in the world 
since the end of World War II and our adversaries seek to do 
mischief or harm us using digital means because they know what 
the consequences are in the physical world and we should be 
marshaling every ounce of our diplomatic, economic, 
informational, and if necessary military power to ensure that 
we extend deterrence into this new domain.
    Senator Young. Thank you.
    Senator Booker. Mr. Young?
    Senator Young. Yes, I am through.
    Senator Booker. Thank you very much for your questions. 
Thank you very much. Yes, I will get a staffer to help you with 
your microphone next time.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. Thank you, my friend. As always, your 
thorough questions are informative and important. So thank you.
    I want to start and jump in.
    Ms. Ba, you have been spared the scorn in questioning of my 
colleagues. So I want to jump in with you on some really--what 
I think are really important issues.
    I have great concern that we are heading as a globe 
spiraling into the greatest food insecurity our planet has ever 
seen, affecting more people than ever and, obviously, this is 
an issue for Cote d'Ivoire.
    And so I would like to know from you what is the largest 
impact of Russia's war in Ukraine on the agricultural sector in 
the country and what are some thoughts of yours to help to deal 
with any food insecurity that is going to result?
    Ms. Ba. Senator, thank you very much for the question.
    Indeed, the impact of the war has made--exacerbated foods 
insecurity in Cote d'Ivoire and across Africa. Agriculture is 
one of the most important sectors for Cote d'Ivoire. It is one 
of the largest exporters of cocoa--the largest exporters of 
cocoa in the world.
    And so we are looking to continue and to deepen these 
partnerships in the agricultural sector with the U.S. companies 
that are already active in the country but also to set and to 
strengthen a business climate to encourage other American 
companies, because when American companies are working in 
partnership in Cote d'Ivoire and across the region we see 
innovation.
    And so, if confirmed, I would be focused on strengthening 
the role of American companies--the American model--to be able 
to look at how to not only deal with the immediate crisis of 
food security but also to be able to create the conditions so 
that small-scale farmers, larger farmers, women, young people, 
can have livelihoods in the agricultural sector and to be able 
to feed themselves and to be able to sustain their lives in the 
long term.
    Senator Booker. I want to ask you just a personal issue. I 
worry about our economic relationships often with African 
nations when we are often sustaining relationships that reflect 
the colonization of the past.
    And so when you look at Cote d'Ivoire, the Government's 
National Development Plan emphasizes efforts to diversify 
beyond raw commodity exports, which I think is really important 
for the development of countries and their strength.
    They look to promote domestic processing of cocoa beans or 
raw cashews into more finished products, which I think is a 
very healthy economic evolution.
    How can the U.S. support this initiative in diversifying 
their agricultural sector while also ensuring that the other 
priorities--human rights and more--continue to be sustained for 
the evolution of their economy?
    Ms. Ba. Thank you for that as well, Senator.
    Economic opportunity is really the foundation of security 
very often. They go hand in hand, and good governance, 
transparency, accountability is also part and parcel.
    So, if confirmed, I would be looking at how to have 
integrated approaches in all that we do and, really, to bring 
the best of the United States to bear in Cote d'Ivoire, to be 
able to engage with young people, because very often young 
people--77 percent of the population of Cote d'Ivoire are below 
the age of 35--they need to be able to see opportunity and they 
need to be able to see what is possible.
    And the American model is different than a colonial model 
and traditional models, and we have incredible companies. We 
can help Cote d'Ivoire diversify their economy, looking into 
other industries as well like cultural industries.
    But when we look at American companies encouraging 
different models that can look at corporate social 
responsibility and to be able to broaden from an integrated 
perspective, economics, good governance, as well as security.
    Senator Booker. Thank you very much.
    I would like to go quickly to Mr. Fick. We often look at 
the issues of cyberspace, digital policy, in terms of our 
fears, concerns, and understandable worries.
    But I would like to maybe frame my question in the 
opportunity side and really ask you that--about the April 28th 
Biden administration's announcement that 61 nations joining 
with them, really, for the Declaration of the Future of the 
Internet, which really affirms the U.S. and other signatories' 
commitments to an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, 
secure Internet that also protects human rights.
    And I guess I would like to know how do you envision the 
CDP Bureau's role in pursuit of this new global partnership and 
what aspects of the declaration you are going to be 
prioritizing.
    Mr. Fick. Senator, thank you for taking us from thinking 
about this issue solely in terms of strategic competition and 
affording an opportunity to talk about the positive affirmative 
vision for what technology can do globally, and I think the 
Declaration for the Future of the Internet is exactly that.
    It is an aspirational framework and it is one that has a 
lot of power as a galvanizing set of principles to help build a 
voluntary coalition of like-minded partners and allies who 
share our view of an open, free, interoperable, secure digital 
future.
    If confirmed, I would use this role to try to expand the 
number of states who are signatories to that document and do it 
by telling a positive--again, affirmative story of the power of 
technology.
    And I think about my colleagues down the table who may be 
representing the United States in parts of the world where for 
the first time in human history, literally, at their fingertips 
young people can have all of the world's information available 
to them and that is--that is an incredibly powerful 
transformative force.
    Senator Booker. All right.
    I made a mistake. I am going to end my questioning--I tend 
to leave my questions till the very end. We are going to go to 
Senator Van Hollen, who is an extraordinary partner and 
important member of this committee.
    Then we are going to go back to some procedural questions I 
have for the entire panel that I should have asked at the top. 
Then I have some of the most grueling, brutal questions I have 
ever asked somebody for Mr. Schiffer, and then we are done. I 
think everybody else is going to submit for the record.
    Mr. Schiffer, please get ready for me to come at you hard.
    But, Mr. Van Hollen, go ahead.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and 
congratulations to all of you and I look forward to supporting 
all of your nominations. You have already been committed to 
public service in various forms and I think you will all do a 
terrific job in the posts for which you have been nominated.
    Mr. Schiffer, we are going to miss you here but look 
forward to working with you.
    Mr. Fick, I was really glad to see Secretary Blinken 
announce the establishment--the formal establishment of the 
Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy. I understand the 
concerns raised by Senator Portman but I think you addressed 
them well and I do believe that you will establish those lanes 
of responsibility.
    And I was glad to hear the Chairman talk about the upside 
of the Internet. I mean, there are places all over the world 
where it has become a forum that brings people together to 
support freedom of expression, human rights.
    Of course, authoritarian regimes recognize that, which is 
why they are so determined to block off access to that kind of 
information. We have seen Putin doing that in Russia. We have 
seen President Xi do it in China.
    And so it is a challenge for us to make sure that that 
model is not exported to countries around the world, which 
China is, certainly, trying to do in places like Africa where 
we have many nominees appointed to be ambassador.
    So I just look forward to following up with you. I also 
serve on the Appropriations Committee. The authorizers have, I 
think, on a bipartisan basis supported this mission and I want 
to make sure that the appropriators do so.
    In the interests of time I look forward to continuing the 
conversation with you down the road.
    Mr. Fick. Thank you, Senator. It is mutual.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you.
    Let me turn, if I could, to you, Ambassador Tamlyn, and I 
heard your opening statement from my office and appreciate your 
answers to questions here.
    So the DRC, as you well know, is an incredibly complicated 
place with all sorts of rivalries and conflicts, especially in 
the east, and my question for you is what do you think is at 
the heart of those conflicts and what can you do as a U.S. 
Ambassador to try to address them in the long-term interests of 
stability in the DRC?
    Ms. Tamlyn. Thank you, Senator. That is a really important 
question because I think too often we get derailed by saying he 
did something, they did something, somebody did something, who 
is to blame, and you really have to look at the root causes of 
the conflict.
    And in my view, it has to do with lack of governance and it 
has to do with a very valuable part of the country in terms of 
its natural resources. So there is, inevitably, competition 
both inside the country as well as outside the country for 
access to those resources.
    And in the absence of a strong government providing 
services to the people you have instead a whole network of 
armed groups, which provide some form of local governance but 
usually not a very good form of local governance.
    So what can we do to tackle this situation? We need to work 
very closely with regional organizations and with leaders in 
the region to make sure that tension is deescalated, that the 
region does not fall into another conflict because we have seen 
how devastating that was.
    So it is very important that leaders get the message and, 
believe me, the State Department has been messaging recently to 
leaders on the importance of reducing tensions, of cooperating 
and having dialogue with neighbors and using those regional 
bodies and mechanisms to try to resolve conflicts.
    I think also some of our programming, which tries to 
address root causes of conflict, which can be traced to 
exploitation of minerals in a nonsustainable and a 
nonaccountable, nontransparent way, if we can address that, 
that helps some of those local grievances and, again, 
supporting the Government to be the kind of government that 
provides the security and services to the people that they 
aspire to.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you for hitting on all those 
points, and I know that Senator Booker raised the issue of rare 
earth minerals in his opening statement. That, obviously, is 
part of what is at the heart of this--a lot of these conflicts, 
and so look forward to working with you on that as well.
    I do want to bring to your attention a great Marylander who 
has been very involved in the DRC. His name is Pastor Weaver. 
He is the pastor of one of the largest AME churches in 
Maryland. He is the president of the Pan African Collective. He 
has established a school, the Weaver School, in the DRC that 
has over 900 students in primary and secondary school, 20 
percent of them orphans.
    Our former ambassador, Mike Hammer, visited the school, and 
so my ask of you is once you get settled there if you would 
also go out to see the school. I think it is a great example of 
the faith-based community here in the United States supporting 
important humanitarian educational efforts in Africa.
    Ms. Tamlyn. Thank you, Senator.
    If confirmed, it would be my pleasure to go and visit.
    Thank you.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Booker. I am very grateful for you, Senator Cardin.
    So I am going to get my Schiffer questions done. Prepare 
yourself, sir. There will be five questions. I hope you can 
answer them as quickly as possible. Then we will have 
procedural questions and then, I think, we are a wrap.
    So, Mr. Schiffer, obviously, there is a crisis in Sri Lanka 
right now. The president fled and resigned amongst a really 
full-scale economic crisis and protests. There was a new Sri 
Lankan president that was elected by the parliament very 
closely affiliated, unfortunately or fortunately, depending on 
your views here, but I imagine it is unfortunately, that does 
not have public confidence.
    I am really wondering about USAID and what we could do to 
sort of guide or alter our policies there and how we might 
respond quickly to support any meaningful democratic process, 
institution capacity building, civil society bolstering, in the 
weeks and months ahead.
    Mr. Schiffer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I mean, the situation in Sri Lanka has been, truly, in a 
different way but similar to Burma tragic over the past several 
months.
    My understanding is that USAID has sought to engage to 
provide for the immediate humanitarian assistance, given the 
economic crisis on the ground and in Sri Lanka, and that we--
the USAID is part of the larger set of activities to coordinate 
with other partners in the region, including through the Quad, 
to look to support proper governance in Sri Lanka.
    I think this is a long-term rebuilding process. It is an 
issue that, if confirmed, I do intend to look at closely and 
come back to this committee and to you to consult and to get 
your guidance.
    Senator Booker. I really hope we can have that 
conversation.
    All right, sir. This is the speed round, four last 
questions, the last chance this committee is going to have to 
verbally question you before you leave us. We all have 
abandonment issues as senators so prepare yourself.
    Your first question--you are an Asia expert, correct?
    Mr. Schiffer. Allegedly.
    Senator Booker. Then you will be able to tell me, sir, the 
Han Dynasty from--in China from the year 200 BC to the year 220 
AD, what were the three biggest accomplishments of the Han 
Dynasty?
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. Let the record show you could not answer.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. Number two, sir. There is a significant 
movement going on in parts of Asia that you, I am sure, have 
heard of that is called K-pop. Could you please tell me your 
three favorite male K-pop bands?
    Mr. Schiffer. There is only one K-pop band and that is BTS. 
So that is my answer.
    Senator Booker. That is wrong, and let the record show that 
you got yet another answer wrong.
    And then, finally, you know that modern mathematics was 
really innovated in Asia--the extraordinary accomplishments in 
math and science.
    So my final question for you, sir--three wrong answers for 
an Asia expert--but my final question for you, sir, is what is 
the square root of 1,256?
    Mr. Schiffer. Am I allowed to call on a family member?
    Senator Booker. You cannot phone a friend, sir.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. Let the record show you are 0 for 3 in your 
final moments before the United States Senate highest--longest 
serving committee, the Foreign Relations Committee. What an 
ignominious way to end, sir, and I am very disappointed in you.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. But, however, you are greatly still loved 
by people on both sides of the aisle. Your service has been 
extraordinary.
    I want to say right now I have got to do these perfunctory 
questions. They are important, though. I would hope that there 
would be a hearty yes from all of you in unison. You do not 
have to harmonize your yeses but I would like to hear them, if 
possible.
    Do you agree to appear before this committee and make 
officials from your office available to the committee and 
designated staff when invited?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    Senator Booker. Let the record show I heard yeses from all 
of them.
    Number two, do you commit to keep this committee fully and 
currently informed about the activities under your purview?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    Senator Booker. Let the record show I heard all the yeses.
    Number three, do you commit to engaging in meaningful 
consultation while policies are being developed, not just 
providing notification after the fact?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    Senator Booker. That was not as loud and vocal but I did 
hear everyone.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. The last question is do you commit to 
promptly responding to requests for briefing and information 
requested by the committee and its designated staff?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    Senator Booker. Thank you very much.
    I want to conclude by saying what I said at the top, Mr. 
Ranking Member. These are extraordinary Americans. You all have 
very distinguished service under your belt in the public and 
the private sector.
    You are now taking posts of critical importance that are 
not only of critical strategic national security and economic 
possibility importance for our nation but also, as leaders on 
this planet, really important for humanity.
    There is a story about Abraham Lincoln at a time when he 
was trying to hold our nation together--another time of 
crisis--and he finished this incredible speech that you all 
know, the second inaugural address--``with malice towards none, 
with charity towards all, with firmness in the right as God 
gives us to see the right.''
    Afterwards, he was at a reception and people were crowding 
around him, pulling him in different directions. But he was 
pushing through the crowd to find his friend. The friend almost 
did not get in--he was an African-American man--until someone 
recognized this regal man yet humble in spirit and they brought 
him into the reception.
    Lincoln found this Black man and said to him, ``I must know 
what you thought of my speech.'' And the man, again, regal in 
stature but humble of spirit, said, ``Mr. President, you should 
attend to your other guests,'' and he waved him off and said, 
``I need to know what you thought of my speech. My friend, 
please tell me.''
    Now, this would be the last time in American history these 
two men would ever speak to each other, and as Lincoln waited 
the great Frederick Douglass spoke up and he said, ``Mr. 
President, it was a sacred effort.'' A sacred effort.
    You all, should you be confirmed, are continuing that 
spirit in this country. The work you do is sacred. The 
difference that you can make will be extraordinary.
    I wish you and your families the best on the journey that 
you are about to embark upon and may God bless you and always 
bless the United States of America.
    There will be questions for the record. I thank my ranking 
member, and now I need to enter two letters into the record 
before gaveling out, and they are here.
    I would like to, without objection from my colleague and my 
friend--I would like to introduce two letters for the record in 
support of Mr. Fick's nomination.
    No objection being heard, it is so ordered.


    [The information referred to above is located at the end of 
this transcript.]


    Senator Booker. Again, the record will remain--for this 
hearing will remain open until the close of business on 
Thursday, August 4th. Please ensure that questions for the 
record are submitted no later than that date, and as you heard 
from Senator Menendez, please make them thorough.
    Again, congratulations to the nominees' families.
    Senator Rounds. May I----
    Senator Booker. Please. Please.
    Senator Rounds. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I would just say, look, the United States Senate has not 
only the responsibility for advice and consent but also for the 
oversight and, thus, the reason for the questions by the 
Chairman as to being able to appear and it is a very important 
part of the job that we have here.
    I thank you for your answers in that specific regard but 
also for, once again, as we have all tried to express, your 
interest in serving our country and, in particular, your 
families' participation as well, which is sometimes very, very 
challenging.
    And with that, Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you for 
the hairless, or I should say, errorless way in which you 
conducted yourself today with this committee hearing.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Rounds. Thank you.
    Senator Booker. With that final dad joke, this hearing is 
adjourned.


    [Whereupon, at 11:56 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]



                              ----------                              



              Additional Material Submitted for the Record


       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
             to Jessica Davis Ba by Senator Robert Menendez

    Question. Two years ago, President Ouattara made the decision to 
run for a third term in office, triggering the most serious unrest in 
Cote d'Ivoire since the conflict in 2011. His main political rivals, 
like him, are from an older generation of political elites. How would 
you assess the state of democracy in Cote d'Ivoire, and what will you 
do as ambassador, if confirmed, to empower democratic voices-especially 
from the youth and marginalized communities-and improve governance in 
the country?

    Answer. Ivoirians overwhelmingly prefer democracy to any other form 
of government--a conclusion based on independent polling by 
Afrobarometer. If confirmed, I will stress the common democratic values 
shared by the Americans and Ivoirians--participation, inclusion, 
transparency, and accountability--assured through the democratic 
process. Although the 2020 presidential election period was marked by 
several incidents of violence, the national legislative elections in 
March 2021 were conducted freely and fairly with broad participation 
from opposition parties. The next election cycle is expected to begin 
in 2023 for municipal and regional seats, followed by presidential and 
legislative elections in 2025 and 2026, respectively. If confirmed, I 
will prioritize U.S. support throughout the election process, expanding 
outreach and coordination with partners in country and with 
multilateral institutions like the Economic Community of West African 
States (ECOWAS) and the African Union. I will urge all actors to 
participate peacefully and to hold those responsible for any violence 
accountable. Cote d'Ivoire's future depends on free and fair elections 
that are held peacefully with an inclusive and transparent electoral 
process. If confirmed, I will urge the Government and political parties 
to engage in a real process of reconciliation through continuation of 
their own National Political Dialogue. To champion participation, 
especially by women young people, and marginalized communities, I will 
encourage Ivoirians to get their national ID cards and register to 
vote. Our Embassy will continue to support the culmination of a larger 
voter literacy effort that ensures increased civic awareness and 
involvement for the average citizen, particularly women, youth, and 
other marginalized communities. If confirmed, I will also urge the 
Government to make voter registration as easy as possible for all 
eligible voters to ensure robust participation. I will prioritize 
opportunities to leverage our programs and convening power to support 
democratic institutions and the democratic process.
    Cote d'Ivoire, like other countries in coastal West Africa, is 
vulnerable to the spread of violent extremism from the Sahel. In 
response to this threat, the Administration has targeted five countries 
in coastal West Africa, including Cote d'Ivoire, priorities under the 
Global Fragility Act. While these countries face some similar 
challenges, there are also marked differences between them, including 
very different systems of governance. For example, Ghana is a 
relatively strong democracy, and Guinea is currently under military 
rule. The five countries also vary in terms of income level, social 
cohesion, and state capacity.

    Question. How does the violent extremist threat manifest itself in 
Cote d'Ivoire? Do you believe that our current assistance programming 
to counter violent extremism in Cote d'Ivoire is appropriately balanced 
between defense, diplomacy, and development?

    Answer. Violent extremist organizations based in the Sahel have 
announced their intention to target Cote d'Ivoire and other coastal 
West African states. In the last two years, over 20 attacks, mainly 
targeting security services have occurred in the northern region of 
Cote d'Ivoire along the border with Burkina Faso. If confirmed as U.S. 
Ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire, I will work with a broad range of 
stakeholders within the Ivoirian Government and civil society to ensure 
that implementation of the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and 
Promote Stability (SPCPS) includes the appropriate balance of defense, 
diplomacy, and development tools to support Cote d'Ivoire's National 
Development Plan and government-community cooperation to build 
resilience against this threat. If confirmed, I will work with the 
interagency Embassy team as well as our regional partners at the USAID-
West Africa regional mission, USAFRICOM, and my counterparts in Guinea, 
Ghana, Togo, and Benin to support the Ivoirian people at the community, 
national, and regional level. In implementing the SPCPS, I will 
prioritize constant evaluation of our investment of U.S. assistance, 
re-balancing any emphasis of our approach to build on opportunities to 
counter violent extremism.

    Question. How will you ensure that resources and programming 
implemented through the Global Fragility Act are appropriately tailored 
to the requirements of Cote d'Ivoire?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with various stakeholders within 
the Ivoirian Government and civil society to ensure programming through 
the Global Fragility Act, implemented according to the U.S. Strategy to 
Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability (SPCPS), is aligned with Cote 
d'Ivoire's National Development Plan and facilitates meaningful 
government-community cooperation. Specifically, the tools we will use 
to implement the SPCPS can reinforce local and national early warning 
systems and action plans to prevent the spread of violent extremism; 
support existing community-led platforms, such as civilian-military 
committees to foster trust between marginalized communities and 
security forces; professionalize law enforcement and other government 
officials to engender trust with the communities they serve; and 
strengthen legal capabilities to hold violent extremist actors 
accountable. If confirmed, I will also emphasize the unique tools each 
of our interagency partners brings to the challenges in Cote d'Ivoire 
to ensure efficient and effective whole-of-government action to achieve 
the U.S. objective of long-term peace and stability. Under my 
leadership, through interagency coordination and planning, U.S. Embassy 
Abidjan will tailor USG assistance to the specific needs of local 
communities to reinforce their resilience against the threat of violent 
extremism, while creating opportunities to build trust with state 
authorities. To implement this long-term plan, U.S. Embassy Abidjan 
plans to hire additional staff to collect and analyze data to ensure 
that USG resources and programming are contextually relevant, most 
effectively to the requirements of communities in various regions of 
Cote d'Ivoire.

Democracy and Human Rights
    Question. What are the most important actions you have taken in 
your career to date to support democracy and human rights? What has 
been the impact of your actions?

    Answer. Throughout my career, I have been dedicated to championing 
democracy and respect for human rights. Most of my overseas tours were 
in countries in which the U.S. Government focused on building 
government and civil society capacity, where I worked to advance 
democracy and respect for human rights. I learned that individual 
actions can make a difference to shape outcomes that support others in 
defending their rights when they may not have the resources or freedom 
to do alone in constrained democratic space. In Guinea, I led our 
Embassy's effort to empower trade unions through the creative use of 
the Human Rights and Democracy Fund. U.S. assistance helped bring 
unions together across sectors in a country where the authoritarian 
regime curtailed human rights and weakened civil society. The labor 
coalition organized and began peaceful protests against then-President 
Lansana Conte. When the regime responded with violence, the labor 
leaders continued to mobilize Guineans to demand change. When security 
forces stormed the headquarters of one of the unions, I mobilized our 
Embassy colleagues across agencies who weighed in with their 
counterparts to ensure due process. The labor leaders credited our 
embassy with saving their lives. We continued to support the unions and 
I shared best practices from American labor and civil rights movements. 
When the Government responded with violence, we urged the Government to 
engage its citizens in peaceful dialogue. The labor movement led 
general nationwide strikes that eventually pushed the president to 
appoint a more inclusive cabinet and they won a promise for democratic 
elections for the Guinean people to chart their own future.
    From this experience, I recognized that my actions to support 
democratic coalitions and build partnerships to advance universal human 
rights could make a difference. U.S. support inspired confidence in 
Guinea's citizens to stand up for their rights and build a movement 
that opened new opportunities for democratic renewal. I took lessons 
from Guinea to each of my subsequent assignments. For example, in 
Somalia, I negotiated among warring parties in the Djibouti Peace 
Process for the election of a new transitional federal government 
integrating wider representation of moderate voices. In Kenya, I 
engaged women, youth groups, and the private sector to support a 
peaceful referendum and electoral process. In Iraq, I insisted that the 
U.S. police training program include human rights instruction in every 
aspect of our engagement, even when the Iraqi Government requested that 
we remove these program components. I worked with the African Union to 
strengthen its elections monitoring and collaborated with partners and 
AU member states to invest more resources to support elections across 
the African continent. In Chad, I engaged at the highest level of the 
Government to link our assistance to accountability for human rights 
violations. We centered all partnerships for security sector reform on 
building more transparent institutions for the benefit of the people of 
Chad. I consistently open space for those seeking to make their voices 
heard and create opportunities to leverage U.S. assistance resources to 
support human rights and advance democracy. If confirmed, I will bring 
this experience to support the aspirations of the people of Cote 
d'Ivoire.

    Question. What issues are the most pressing challenges to democracy 
or democratic development in Cote d'Ivoire? These challenges might 
include obstacles to participatory and accountable governance and 
institutions, rule of law, authentic political competition, civil 
society, human rights, and press freedom. Please be as specific as 
possible.

    Answer. One of the biggest challenges to democratic development in 
Cote d'Ivoire is ensuring that the Government can meet the needs of all 
its citizens, particularly vulnerable groups in the North of the 
country. The United States is deeply concerned about increased violent 
extremism along the northern Ivoirian border. The Government of Cote 
d'Ivoire has expressed its support for the U.S. Strategy to Prevent 
Conflict and Promote Stability (SPCPS), the implementation of which 
will support the Government's efforts to address many of these needs in 
the region. One of the main lines of effort for the U.S. Strategy is to 
focus on building trust between security forces and the communities 
they serve.
    More broadly, Cote d'Ivoire has never experienced a peaceful 
transition of power. The 2021 legislative elections were a significant 
step towards reconciliation and socio-political cohesion. The ongoing 
national political dialogue is making important progress. However, this 
progress remains fragile and if confirmed, I will ensure the United 
States supports the people of Cote d'Ivoire as the country moves 
towards the 2023 local elections and the 2025 presidential election.
    As part of the effort to build social cohesion, the United States 
has called on the Government of Cote d'Ivoire to respect the human 
rights of all individuals in Cote d'Ivoire, notably freedoms of 
expression and peaceful assembly, and to ensure that all those arrested 
are afforded fair trials. Through implementation of the SPCPS, Embassy 
Abidjan is planning to support a judicial advisor to support Cote 
d'Ivoire's justice sector reforms. If confirmed, I will continue to 
speak out for democratic pluralism, rule of law, press freedom, and 
respect for human rights.

    Question. What steps will you take--if confirmed--to support 
democracy in of Cote d'Ivoire? What do you hope to accomplish through 
these actions? What are the potential impediments to addressing the 
specific obstacles you have identified?

    Answer. Supporting good governance and democracy in Cote d'Ivoire 
is a key goal of our bilateral relationship. If confirmed, I will 
continue to urge the Government of Cote d'Ivoire to capitalize on their 
advancements towards increasing respect for democracy, and human rights 
and fundamental freedoms through their National Dialogue and 
Reconciliation plan. I will also work with Ivoirian civil society and 
opposition groups to encourage their participation in the democratic 
process. If confirmed, I will address potential impediments to 
democratic ideals and institutions, including security concerns and 
economic inequality. I will engage personally with the Ivoirian 
Government, civil society, and opposition groups to ensure that all 
voices are heard, and all interests are represented at the local and 
national government level. Specifically, through an interagency 
collaborative effort with State and USAID, I will promote fairer voter 
registration processes through civic education, voter list analysis, 
and efforts to increase the accessibility of electoral data for all 
citizens of Cote d'Ivoire.
    If confirmed, I will collaborate with the Government of Cote 
d'Ivoire, political parties, civil society organizations, and other 
diplomatic missions to promote political reforms, reinforce democratic 
institutions, and strengthen electoral institutions and processes to 
promote free and fair elections. I will also support the right to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and association and encourage all 
Ivoirians to participate in local and national elections as low voter 
confidence and participation could become an impediment to a robust 
democracy.

    Question. How will you utilize U.S. Government assistance resources 
at your disposal, including the Democracy Commission Small Grants 
program and other sources of State Department and USAID funding, to 
support democracy and governance, and what will you prioritize in 
processes to administer such assistance?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would utilize all available U.S. assistance 
tools and programs to support democracy and governance in Cote d'Ivoire 
and prioritize programs that best support U.S. goals in the country. 
The continued use of available State Department and USAID regional and 
centrally managed resources are crucial to advancing democracy and 
respect for human rights in Cote d'Ivoire. If confirmed, I would also 
seek to leverage the Government of Cote d'Ivoire's strong MCC Compact 
to encourage further reforms that improve transparency and reduce 
corruption. In 2019, A Compact Program between Cote d'Ivoire and MCC to 
improve transportation conditions and to promote new employability and 
productivity skills entered into force. U.S. assistance and the 
partnerships forged through the MCC Compact will be critical to driving 
economic growth and reducing poverty in the country, particularly for 
women and youth.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to meet with civil society 
members, human rights, and other non-governmental organizations in the 
U.S. and with local human rights NGOs, and other members of civil 
society in Cote d'Ivoire? What steps will you take to pro-actively 
address efforts to restrict or penalize NGOs and civil society via 
legal or regulatory measures?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to regularly meeting and hearing 
directly from civil society and political actors who support 
strengthening Cote d'Ivoire's democracy and civil society. I would 
build on interagency Embassy efforts to urge the Government to 
incorporate opposition voices and civil society in their political 
dialogue and national reconciliation plan. I would also continue to 
encourage the Government to build trust by allowing NGOs and civil 
society true freedom of peaceful assembly and association.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to meet with democratically 
oriented political opposition figures and parties? What steps will you 
take to encourage genuine political competition? Will you advocate for 
access and inclusivity for women, minorities, and youth within 
political parties?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to continuing and strengthening the 
relationships our mission has built with democratically oriented 
political opposition figures and parties. I will strive to support the 
efforts of these figures and parties to develop a more inclusive 
political environment in Cote d'Ivoire, including their participation 
in the government-initiated dialogue with opposition parties. I will 
urge the Government to ensure the freedom of association and peaceful 
assembly for all political actors, even those with whom they do not 
agree. The upcoming 2023 local elections are a key steppingstone for 
young people, women, and minorities, in particular, who want to enter 
politics because they offer more opportunities for seats than national-
level elections. Through public statements, State Public Diplomacy and 
USAID programming, and direct engagements, I will advocate for a 
political environment that is inclusive of women, youth, minorities, 
and people throughout Cote d'Ivoire who might otherwise be 
marginalized.

    Question. Will you and your embassy team actively engage with Cote 
d'Ivoire on freedom of the press and address any government efforts 
designed to control or undermine press freedom through legal, 
regulatory, or other measures? Will you commit to meeting regularly 
with independent, local press in Cote d'Ivoire?

    Answer. Restrictions on the press, politically motivated arrests, 
excessive limitations on applications for political gatherings, self-
censorship, and suspensions of press outlets have no place in a strong 
democracy. If confirmed, I would, along with the rest of my Embassy 
team, prioritize work with the Government of Cote d'Ivoire to prevent 
restrictions on media outlets and reporters and to remind the 
Government and all people that freedom of expression, including for 
members of the press is key to maintaining a healthy democracy. If 
confirmed, I will commit to meeting regularly with independent and 
local press outlets in Cote d'Ivoire as a visible sign of support for 
freedom of expression, including for members of the press.

    Question. Will you and your embassy team actively engage with civil 
society and government counterparts on countering disinformation and 
propaganda disseminated by foreign state or non-state actors in the 
country?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will engage civil society and government 
counterparts to build on the embassy team's progress and programs to 
combat disinformation and propaganda perpetuated by foreign state and 
non-state actors. A well-informed population is required for a 
functioning democracy, and I will prioritize our efforts to build a 
stronger information and media ecosystem to combat misinformation and 
disinformation. I will support embassy programs to educate journalists 
about the dangers of disinformation, including training that offers 
recent examples like the disinformation circulated on the efficacy and 
safety of COVID-19 vaccines and on Russia's war in Ukraine. USAID and 
State Public Diplomacy will continue to work with social media 
influencers, local radio stations, and community storytellers to 
deconstruct misinformation and disinformation, particularly in northern 
communities, to address issues pertaining to violent extremism and 
attempts to distance the population from the state.

    Question. Will you and your embassy teams actively engage with Cote 
d'Ivoire on the right of labor groups to organize, including for 
independent trade unions?

    Answer. Cote d'Ivoire's law, including related regulations and 
statutory instruments, provides for the right of workers, except 
members of police and military services, to form or join unions of 
their choice; provides for the right to conduct legal strikes and 
bargain collectively; and prohibits discrimination by employers or 
others against union members or organizers. It further prohibits firing 
workers for union activities and provides for the reinstatement of 
dismissed workers within eight days of winning a wrongful dismissal 
claim. The law protects unions' ability to conduct their activities 
without interference. Worker organizations in Cote d'Ivoire have been 
independent of the Government and political parties. Despite strong 
legal frameworks, forced labor and labor trafficking have been 
documented in key economic sectors. Concerns regarding government 
enforcement of worker rights' protections, including on child labor and 
forced labor, remain. If confirmed, I and my team will encourage the 
Government of Cote d'Ivoire to enforce the legal rights of organized 
labor, civil society, and workers. By putting the right tools in the 
hands of labor inspectors, business owners, workers, and service 
providers, we can advance greater transparency and accountability, 
prevent bad actors from profiting on the backs of workers, and better 
identify when grueling or poorly paid work becomes involuntary forced 
labor, thus violating international standards and national laws.

    Question. Will you commit to using your position, if confirmed, to 
defend the human rights and dignity of all people in Cote d'Ivoire, no 
matter their sexual orientation or gender identity?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue to support the human rights 
of all residents of Cote d'Ivoire and their ability to live free from 
discrimination based on their identity, ethnicity, or medical status. 
Through collaboration with Ivoirian NGOs, the Embassy supports 
programming that promotes the human rights and representation of women 
and LGBTQI+ persons in politics, increases their access to the Ivoirian 
economy, and increases public-private partnerships to encourage citizen 
participation and local governance. Embassy Abidjan's PEPFAR program 
directly improves access to and quality of HIV services for members of 
the LGBTQI+ population through engagement with the Ministry of Health, 
LGBTQI+-led organizations, and external stakeholders, including UNAIDS. 
Under my leadership, we will not compromise on these important American 
and global ideals. If confirmed, I will work hard to encourage Cote 
d'Ivoire to continue this positive trajectory.

    Question. What challenges do the lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people face in Cote d'Ivoire?

    Answer. Violence and discrimination targeting LGBTQI+ persons 
remain a challenge in the country, primarily due to societal norms. 
Homosexuality is not illegal, but it is not widely accepted. Same-sex 
marriages are not recognized as legal unions in Cote d'Ivoire, and 
legal protections against discrimination do not exist. A 2022 effort in 
parliament to provide legal protections against discrimination was 
withdrawn in the face of public opposition. LGBTQI+ persons in Cote 
d'Ivoire report being stigmatized by their families, communities, 
religious leaders, and health providers.

    Question. What specifically will you commit to do to help LGBTQ 
people in Cote d'Ivoire?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will call on the Government of Cote 
d'Ivoire to investigate allegations of violence and discrimination 
targeting LGBTQI+ persons. I also commit to continuing the Embassy's 
strong slate of programming around LGBTQI+ issues in Cote d'Ivoire. I 
will pledge to work with the LGBTQI+ community and follow their lead, 
under the principle of ``do no harm,'' to promote respect for the human 
rights of LGBTQI+ persons. PEPFAR's ongoing engagement with Ivoirian 
civil society to improve HIV/TB services and respect for the human 
rights of every member of the LGBTQI+ community presents an additional 
opportunity for my direct engagement and advocacy.

Congressional Consultations
    Question. Will you commit, if confirmed, to ensuring that you fully 
brief members of congress and/or their staff each time you are in 
Washington for visits or consultations during your tenure as Ambassador 
to Cote d'Ivoire?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit, in coordination with the State 
Department's Bureau of Legislative Affairs, to respond promptly to all 
appropriate requests for briefings and for information by this 
Committee. Congress has an important role to play in foreign policy 
legislation and during the implementation process. Our foreign policy 
is stronger when the two branches of government coordinate, and I look 
forward to strengthening the coordination between our two branches.

Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility
    Question. Last week we held a hearing on the important work of the 
State Department's Chief Diversity Officer and the important role 
diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility efforts play in 
maintaining our countries' competitive edge on the global stage. How do 
you anticipate fostering diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
accessibility at Embassy Abidjan?

    Answer. Throughout my State Department career, I have championed a 
diverse, inclusive, and equitable work environment and have encouraged 
policies that advance these values. If confirmed, I intend to bring 
that same spirit to Embassy Abidjan by supporting post's inclusive 
hiring and selection procedures and to expand recruiting to ensure we 
have the greatest expertise and diversity of experience represented in 
our mission. I will ensure active community participation in Embassy 
Abidjan's Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Council and 
support initiatives the Council proposes. I will also encourage every 
member of the Embassy to make recommendations on how we can be more 
inclusive and equitable in our operations, practices, and policies. 
Embassy Abidjan has already been active in this area, with monthly 
dialogues on these issues, and institutional innovations such as cross-
cultural training, Mission-wide mentorship programs, and targeted 
hiring for persons with disabilities. I commit to listening to both 
local and U.S. colleagues to ensure that we continue to make progress 
on these gains.

    Question. What specifically will you do to prioritize and promote 
diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, while also combating 
racism, discrimination, and inequality among locally employed staff in 
Cote d'Ivoire?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will make clear that Embassy Abidjan will 
have a zero-tolerance policy for racism and discrimination, in keeping 
with Equal Employment Opportunity laws. I intend to ensure that all 
employees working in Embassy Abidjan, whether they are locally employed 
staff, eligible family members, or U.S. direct hires, feel supported 
and have the tools and opportunities they need to contribute to our 
priorities. I will seek input on ways to make our operations, programs, 
and outreach more equitable including by maintaining an open office 
policy and welcoming the contributions and ideas of all working in our 
mission. I will also actively support Embassy Abidjan's existing 
mentorship programs for First and Second Tour Officers, Mid-level U.S. 
Direct Hires, and our Locally Engaged Staff. I will ensure our Embassy 
meets the professional development needs of staff and that everyone 
feels safe, welcome, and empowered to contribute to our mission 
objectives.

    Question. In addition to focusing on diversity, equity, inclusion, 
and accessibility in our workforce, will you commit to engaging more 
equitably in operations and programming, particularly with potential 
partners and communities that traditionally have been marginalized, 
excluded, or underrepresented in ours and others' donor and partnership 
efforts? How do you anticipate utilizing local expertise, knowledge, 
and capacity to meet our foreign policy goals?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to engaging with partners and 
communities that have been traditionally marginalized, underrepresented 
or excluded in donor or partnership efforts. Throughout my State 
Department career, I have expanded outreach and encouraged new 
partnerships through U.S. programs to communities that have 
historically been marginalized. I will bring this commitment to 
Abidjan, working across U.S. Government agencies to evaluate existing 
operations and programs to identify opportunities where our assistance 
and partnerships can be more inclusive. In particular, I will focus on 
integrating women and young people, ensuring we reach all regions of 
Cote d'Ivoire, including through creative deployment of the internet, 
including social media. Learning from local expertise and knowledge is 
critical to building successful programs and to advance U.S. foreign 
policy goals.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
             to Jessica Davis Ba by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. In December 2020, President Ouattara was sworn in for a 
controversial 3rd term as president of Cote d'Ivoire. The issue of the 
3rd term was a significant issue in Cote d'Ivoire, and taken against a 
backdrop of multiple coups in the region since 2020 is part of a 
worrying trend.

   As U.S. Ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire, how will you engage with 
        Ivorian stakeholders ahead of the 2024 elections to ensure a 
        peaceful democratic transfer of power?

    Answer. Ivoirians overwhelmingly prefer democracy than any other 
form of government--a conclusion based on independent polling by 
Afrobarometer. If confirmed, I will stress the common democratic values 
shared by the Americans and Ivoirians--participation, inclusion, 
transparency, and accountability--assured through the democratic 
process. Although the 2020 presidential election period was marked by 
several incidents of violence, the nationwide legislative elections in 
March 2021 were conducted freely and fairly with broad participation 
from opposition parties. The next election cycle is expected to begin 
in 2023 for municipal and regional seats, followed by presidential and 
legislative elections due in 2025 and 2026, respectively. I will 
prioritize U.S. support throughout the election process, expanding 
outreach and coordination with partners in country and with 
multilateral institutions like the Economic Community of West African 
States (ECOWAS) and the African Union. If confirmed, I will urge all 
actors to participate peacefully and to hold those responsible for 
violence accountable. Cote d'Ivoire's future depends on free and fair 
elections that are inclusive, transparent, and peaceful.
    If confirmed, I will urge the Government and political parties to 
engage in a real process of reconciliation through continuation of 
their own National Political Dialogue. To champion participation, 
especially by women, young people, and marginalized communities, I will 
encourage Ivoirians to get their national ID cards and register to 
vote. I will also urge the Government to make registering as easy as 
possible for all eligible voters to ensure participation is as high and 
robust as possible. I will ensure Embassy efforts around political 
participation and inclusivity continue through the election cycles, 
such as the ongoing USAID programming to encourage political 
reconciliation in communities affected by the election-related violence 
of 2020 and State and USAID efforts to increase political participation 
among historically underrepresented groups, in particular youth and 
women. I will prioritize opportunities to leverage our programs and 
convening power to support democratic institutions and the democratic 
process.
    As concerns about the spread of violent extremist organizations 
across the Sahel increases, U.S. strategy for preventing violent 
extremism has shifted focus to the countries of coastal West Africa, 
including Cote d'Ivoire. As part of this strategy, coastal West Africa, 
including Cote d'Ivoire, was selected as a target for implementation of 
the Global Fragility Act.

    Question. As U.S. Ambassador, how will you balance engaging with 
Ivorian stakeholders on important domestic issues while also 
recognizing that Cote d'Ivoire is part of a broader U.S. strategy to 
prevent violent extremism?

    Answer. If confirmed as U.S. Ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire, I will 
work with various stakeholders within the Ivoirian Government and civil 
society to support efforts to address domestic issues, such as uneven 
economic growth and access to basic services, while also encouraging 
meaningful Ivoirian participation in multilateral bodies such as the 
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African 
Union. Together, these approaches will help Cote d'Ivoire improve its 
resilience to the threat of violent extremism emanating from the Sahel. 
If confirmed, I will work with the entire Embassy team to ensure that 
we achieve the correct balance of supporting the people inside Cote 
d'Ivoire, while maintaining an active role and voice in regional 
engagement and strategies.

    Question. Cote d'Ivoire is the world's largest producer of cocoa, 
and Cote d'Ivoire and its immediate neighbor Ghana produce 
approximately 60 percent of the world's cocoa. While Cote d'Ivoire is a 
source of cocoa for numerous American and European chocolate companies, 
the industry is also working to combat worrying levels of child labor 
in the production of cocoa in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana.

   As U.S. Ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire, how will you engage with both 
        the Government of Cote d'Ivoire and American chocolate 
        companies to address the issue of child labor, while also 
        balancing the important role cocoa plays in the Ivorian economy 
        and to American companies?

    Answer. Cote d'Ivoire has made significant efforts to eliminate the 
worst forms of child labor. The Government has addressed child labor 
conditions through the adoption, elaboration, and amendment of several 
policies, laws, and programs. These efforts included finalizing the 
National Action Plan for the Fight Against the Worst Forms of Child 
Labor, revising the Labor Code, adopting an Anti-Trafficking law in 
2016, signing a cross-border cooperation agreement with Ghana, drafting 
a document specifying types of permitted light work, and revising the 
list of hazardous work.
    I am aware of heightened concerns about child labor in the cocoa 
sector and, if confirmed, I and my Embassy Team as well as interagency 
colleagues will work closely with the Ivoirian Government, other 
countries, NGOs, and the chocolate industry to address them. I will 
continue to work with the Ivoirian Government and the U.S. Department 
of Labor (DOL) through the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group 
(CLCCG). U.S. companies expressed concern about the expiration of the 
Harkin-Engel Protocol, which offered a forum for public and private 
sector engagement on efforts to reduce child labor in the production of 
cocoa.
    I am also aware of the important place that the cocoa sector has in 
the Ivoirian economy and of the investment that U.S. companies have 
made in the cocoa sector, which is improving livelihoods in this 
region. If confirmed, I will continue the Embassy's close dialogue and 
coordination with U.S. and international cocoa companies which do 
business in Cote d'Ivoire. Realizing that poverty and limited access to 
education are significant drivers of child labor, if confirmed, I will 
continue our active support of sustainable and resilient economic 
growth, women's economic empowerment, improving access to education, 
and improving health services. Our efforts to increase law enforcement 
capacity will help Cote d'Ivoire deal with those who use and traffic in 
child labor. Together, we can incorporate holistic solutions to combat 
the worst forms of child labor in the cocoa sector.

State Department Manangement and Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Abidjan?

    Answer. Embassy Abidjan's strong morale has been driven by 
community-led investments in the mission's institutions, including 
mentorship programs for both local and U.S. employees, its Diversity, 
Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Council, greening initiatives, and 
active employee associations. I intend to continue supporting these 
vital organizations and making the most out of employee and family 
member contributions along the way. However, maintaining this positive 
momentum in the face of external challenges and rapid growth will 
require additional resources to ensure we can build upon our promising 
relationship with the host government.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Abidjan?

    Answer. If confirmed, maintaining morale of all members of Mission 
Abidjan will be of utmost importance for me. I intend to work closely 
with my staff, understand their concerns and seek ways to find 
immediate remedies for issues that we can address in Abidjan. For those 
issues where our community requires additional support, I will 
communicate staff needs back to Department leadership. I believe that 
the best work comes from well-resourced teams that support one another 
towards achieving common goals and advancing U.S. policies. I will work 
across the interagency and with Washington to ensure that future growth 
meets U.S. strategic objectives and can be supported effectively by 
post's management platform.
    Recent growth has dramatically increased the number of eligible 
family members resident at Embassy Abidjan. Our Foreign Service family 
members contribute directly to mission morale, and if confirmed, I will 
ensure that those family members are also supported by improving 
educational options in country and ensuring that eligible family 
members who wish to work find meaningful employment at Embassy Abidjan.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Abidjan?

    Answer. If confirmed, I intend to ensure that all employees working 
in Embassy Abidjan, whether they are Locally Engaged Staff, eligible 
family members, or U.S. direct hires, feel supported and heard in their 
work. I maintain an open office policy and welcome the contributions 
and ideas of those working in our mission. I will also actively support 
Embassy Abidjan's existing mentorship programs for First and Second 
Tour Officers, mid-level U.S. Direct Hires, and our Locally Employed 
Staff and ensure that they meet the professional development needs of 
staff. Throughout my State Department career, I have valued and 
encouraged a diverse and inclusive work environment, and if confirmed, 
I intend to bring that same spirit to Embassy Abidjan by supporting 
post's inclusive hiring and selection procedures and active community 
participation in Embassy Abidjan's Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and 
Accessibility Council events. Most important, I will convene regular 
conversations across the Mission to reinforce a shared vision by 
listening to the input of our staff and assessing progress on our 
Integrated Country Strategy.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I would describe my management style as collaborative. Over 
the last two decades, I have created diverse teams to develop a shared 
vision for how we collectively implement U.S. policy priorities. I seek 
input broad input from colleagues, stakeholders, and partners to inform 
the most effective strategies to achieve our policy priorities and 
integrate these perspectives into plans that I share with all those 
consulted. My leadership and management style is focused on empowering 
staff, delegating responsibilities to experts, and removing roadblocks 
to achieve results. I prioritize communication to gain the benefit of 
regular feedback and to facilitate decision-making. If confirmed, I 
will prioritize collaboration and partnerships, including from 
Congressional representatives, to achieve U.S. policy priorities in 
Cote d'Ivoire.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. Absolutely not. Under no circumstances is that ever 
acceptable. And, if confirmed, I will not tolerate that behavior by any 
member of the Embassy Abidjan community. I will clearly emphasize my 
expectation that all members of our team treat one another and all 
people with whom we come into contact with mutual respect.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. The relationship between an Ambassador and Deputy Chief of 
Mission is fundamental to the success of an Embassy. From my experience 
serving as a DCM, I recognize the importance of establishing the 
positive and productive leadership necessary for the Mission to achieve 
its goals. If confirmed, I will build a relationship of trust with my 
primary advisor--the Deputy Chief of Mission. As the Embassy's 
leadership team, I envision a partnership focused on ensuring every 
member of our Mission has the tools and support they need to protect 
Americans and advance American interests in Cote d'Ivoire. I will 
prioritize communication, teamwork, and ensure my Deputy Chief of 
Mission is prepared to serve as Charge d'affaires, a.i. as required.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I intend to entrust my Deputy Chief of 
Mission (DCM) with the responsibilities akin to those of a Chief 
Operating Officer (COO). I will model the Embassy Front Office on 
Department bureaus, building on best practices in which the Assistant 
Secretary functions as Chief Executive Officer and the Principal Deputy 
Assistant Secretary as COO. I will entrust the DCM to manage the 
effective operations of the Embassy. To ensure the entire Mission is 
engaged in crisis preparedness and emergency planning, I will entrust 
the DCM to chair the interagency Emergency Action Committee to make 
considered recommendations on the safety and security of our Embassy 
and all Americans in Cote d'Ivoire. While both the DCM and I will have 
responsibility for coaching and mentoring the Embassy Team, if 
confirmed, I will also ask the DCM to play the primary role in building 
on existing initiatives to create an inclusive, safe culture for our 
community. It will be my priority to ensure my DCM feels empowered to 
strengthen management controls and oversight on all aspects of Embassy 
operations so that we are deploying taxpayer resources to the greatest 
effect.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking. Do 
you believe that it is important to provide employees with accurate, 
constructive feedback on their performances in order to encourage 
improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their roles?

    Answer. Yes. I believe that providing accurate and constructive 
feedback is important, both through formal evaluations and continuously 
as we carry out our mission. This kind of dialogue is important both 
for Locally Engaged Staff and U.S. Direct Hire employees, and I hope to 
build that culture in Abidjan. I will ensure that each Foreign Service 
Officer has accurate and timely EERs and that all staff have the 
appropriate evaluations of their performance. I will require all 
managers to offer direct feedback about the performance of their staff, 
listening actively to what their team needs to contribute more to 
priority embassy goals. If confirmed, I fully intend to reward those 
who succeed in their roles in the mission, providing an incentive for 
all to achieve their work objectives.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes. I would support and encourage clear, accurate, and 
direct feedback to employees to improve performance and reward high 
achievers. I also want employees to feel comfortable taking calculated 
risks and pursuing innovative approaches to advancing our policy. This 
requires honest dialogue and a culture of trust between employees and 
supervisors. I intend to promote this approach, if confirmed.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Cote d'Ivoire. In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our 
embassy walls enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. In my experience, it is imperative that U.S. diplomats 
leave their office space and meet business, civil society, development, 
media, and government leaders in the country in which they work. If 
confirmed, I will compel my staff to work safely and responsibly in the 
economic capital of Abidjan, and throughout Cote d'Ivoire, to achieve 
our foreign policy goals. For example, to fulfill their roles in 
technical and financial oversight of USG funds, it is critical for 
Embassy staff to regularly engage with field-level beneficiaries and 
implementing partners. As such, the management, logistical, and 
security support to facilitate this field presence will be among my 
priorities. Throughout my career I have valued, both personally and 
professionally, the relationships I have fostered outside the office to 
achieve Mission goals. Therefore, I also intend to travel throughout 
Cote d'Ivoire, inviting members of the mission team across sections to 
join me, to ensure that the United States is visible outside of 
Abidjan.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. While the COVID-19 pandemic has limited our ability to meet 
local populations in person, face-to-face contact is vital to the 
successful advancement of U.S. policy goals in Cote d'Ivoire. If 
confirmed, I will listen to my team to understand what personnel, 
financial, or technological resources they need from the Department to 
carry out our mission effectively. I will advocate to obtain these 
resources to support engagement, including creative use of media 
platforms to amplify and sustain access and engagement with local 
populations.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in Cote 
d'Ivoire?

    Answer. The population in Cote d'Ivoire is generally receptive to 
U.S. messaging, and our team continues developing creative ways to 
reach all populations in the country. Challenges include the COVID-19 
pandemic, poor transportation options, and greater insecurity in 
certain parts of the country. Populations outside of the economic 
capital of Abidjan feel isolated and marginalized. As such, I 
understand the Public Diplomacy team in Cote d'Ivoire is focused on 
programming in remote areas, both at our American Spaces in the 
northern parts of the country and by optimizing travel by all Mission 
members to different regions of Cote d'Ivoire. I understand the team 
also creatively employs technology to reach populations that are not 
easily accessible in person. As in many other parts of the world, our 
Mission team is attentive to activity in the public diplomacy arena 
from global competitors.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. The COVID-19 pandemic has made getting out of the office 
for Public Diplomacy work very challenging, but I understand Mission 
members have been traveling more widely in recent months as conditions 
in Cote d'Ivoire have improved. Poor transportation infrastructure and 
security concerns in the country make travel even more of an 
undertaking, but Mission members understand it is critical to get 
outside the walls of the Embassy to perform public diplomacy work 
effectively. I understand the Country Team coordinates very well 
together to make sure Mission members can move throughout Cote d'Ivoire 
to ensure outreach, including to marginalized communities. The media 
environment in the country continues to develop positively, and our 
team is actively engaged in supporting those efforts to ensure free and 
equal access to information for all persons in Cote d'Ivoire. It is 
critical to link life-saving interventions, such as those supported by 
PEPFAR and the Global Health Security Agenda, with Public Diplomacy to 
ensure appropriate communication of USG funding impact. I will 
encourage coordination and communication among sections such that the 
Public Affairs Office is well-positioned to disseminate the myriad 
examples of fruitful USG collaboration in Cote d'Ivoire. If confirmed, 
I will encourage and support all members of the Mission to take part in 
public diplomacy to engage Ivoirians across sectors and regions.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. I believe it is critical for our public diplomacy team to 
remain in close touch with colleagues at the State Department in 
Washington, balancing the requirements and guidance from Washington 
with the priorities `in the field' to tailor messaging to local 
realities. Our Public Diplomacy teams must develop and maintain 
excellent relationships with colleagues in Washington and across the 
region in order to ensure that messaging is coordinated and that there 
are no surprises on either side. I understand our team in Cote d'Ivoire 
works hard with Washington and regional colleagues to ensure 
synchronized and accurate messaging around all of the U.S. Government's 
work.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes, I commit to addressing this threat. I am deeply 
troubled by potential anomalous health incidents that have affected 
U.S. Government personnel and their family members. Serving one's 
country overseas should not come at the cost of one's health. I agree 
that such incidents may pose a threat to the well-being of U.S. 
personnel and must be taken extremely seriously. I understand Embassy 
Abidjan has put in place standard operating procedures and communicated 
them widely to the mission community so action can be taken swiftly and 
seamlessly if any AHIs are reported. If confirmed, the health, safety, 
and security of Embassy staff, their family members, and all those 
supporting the mission will be my highest priority.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Abidjan personnel?

    Answer. If confirmed, I am committed to regularly share new 
information on this issue consistent with ensuring the integrity of 
ongoing investigations. I commit to ensuring that our staff have the 
resources they need to remain safe and resilient in the face of these 
challenges.

Human Rights and International Organizations
    Question. In the State Department's 2021 Report on Human Rights, 
Cote d'Ivoire is noted for significant human rights issues including 
arbitrary killings; harsh or life-threatening prison conditions; 
arbitrary arrests; politically motived reprisals; problems with an 
independent judiciary, restrictions on freedoms of expression; 
corruption; and more.

   If confirmed, how would you work with the host government to 
        address these issues?

    Answer. If confirmed, I am committed to working with the Government 
of Cote d'Ivoire to address human rights issues by directly supporting 
and advocating on behalf of both local civil society organizations and 
international human rights organizations. Furthermore, the United 
States has called on the Government of Cote d'Ivoire to respect the 
human rights of all individuals in Cote d'Ivoire, notably freedoms of 
expression and peaceful assembly, and to ensure that all those arrested 
are afforded fair trials. If confirmed, I will continue to speak out 
for democratic pluralism, rule of law, and respect for human rights.

    Question. What steps could you take with prison authorities of the 
state to improve life-threatening prison conditions?

    Answer. There are several programs from the Bureau of International 
Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) that facilitate the 
development and improvement of correctional systems. If confirmed, I 
intend to thoroughly review our current programs and consider others 
that will support the transformation of Cote d'Ivoire's prison systems.

    Question. The report additionally notes that within prisons, human 
rights groups report that security officers subject prisoners to abuse 
such as denial of needed medicine and medical attention, electric 
shock, and beatings. Authorities acknowledge that abuse might happen 
and go unreported due to prisoners' fear of reprisal, and impunity was 
a problem with security forces.

   How could you engage with security officials to improve upon 
        reporting practices to address prisoner abuse?

    Answer. While INL programs are designed to create accountability 
with correctional system leadership, I understand there are ongoing 
Embassy efforts to increase engagement with Government of Cote d'Ivoire 
leadership to increase familiarity with policies and practices that are 
consistent with international human rights law.
    In the State Department's 2022 Report on Trafficking in Persons, 
Cote d'Ivoire is currently Tier 2, showing efforts to improve towards 
meeting minimum requirements to eliminate trafficking. However, the 
Government is lacking in key areas such as a lack of law enforcement 
training to investigate and identify victims, national anti-trafficking 
committee meetings did not meet or coordinate anti-trafficking 
activities, and the Government did not allocate a dedicated budget for 
the anti-trafficking committee for the third year in a row.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you work with government officials 
to implement a specialized system of training to develop anti-
trafficking law enforcement officers?

    Answer. Noting that Cote d'Ivoire acknowledges the problem of human 
trafficking and has demonstrated political will to combat it, with 
several high-profile events, I am committed to supporting their efforts 
to combat this devastating practice.

    Question. What steps would you take to encourage the host 
government to address the lack of resources allocated to the anti-
trafficking committee in order to facilitate more operational capacity?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue to advocate for increased 
Government of Cote d'Ivoire investment in its anti-trafficking 
committee. Simultaneously, I commit to supporting the growth and 
development of anti-trafficking civil society organizations (CSOs). 
Through advocacy to the Government of Cote d'Ivoire and creative 
efforts to spotlight effective Ivorian anti-trafficking CSOs, our 
Embassy will continue to support awareness and action to combat 
trafficking. I will encourage expanded partnership with the anti-
trafficking committee and other institutions committed to address this 
scourge.

    Question. Cote d'Ivoire has constitutional provisions for freedom 
of religious belief and prohibition of religious discrimination, as 
well as emphasizing religious tolerance as fundamental to the nation's 
unity. Religious leaders and local law enforcement partner with 
subnational governmental groups to try to prevent violent extremism and 
protect communities from the growing threat of terrorism in the Sahel 
region.

   If confirmed, how could you work with these groups to continue to 
        develop relations that counter violent extremism in the region?

    Answer. Faith-based communities have a powerful role to play in 
supporting democratic institutions, advancing human rights, and 
promoting peace. If confirmed, I will work to support these efforts 
through positive U.S. messaging, direct support for cooperation and 
coordination between these parties, and funding for innovative anti-
extremism strategies. I will continue my predecessor's ongoing 
engagement with religious leaders across faith communities to ensure 
open communication about the threat of violent extremism, respect for 
human rights, and global health.

    Question. Embassy officials have met with the Government to discuss 
the state of religious freedom and tolerance to gather insight on 
levels of violence or discrimination and promote cooperation amongst 
Christian and Muslim groups.

   What is your assessment of the state of religious tolerance in the 
        country?

    Answer. The constitution provides for freedom of religious belief 
and worship, consistent with law and order, and prohibits religious 
discrimination. It emphasizes that religious tolerance is fundamental 
to the nation's unity, peace, reconciliation, and social cohesion and 
forbids speech that encourages religious hatred. Religious leaders 
regularly come together for issues related to social cohesion and 
public health. For example, they partnered with local law enforcement 
and subnational government leadership on security matters to prevent 
violent extremism and protect their communities from the growing 
terrorist threat emanating from the Sahel.

    Question. How could you continue to build upon these discussions 
with the host government to further improve religious tolerance?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would continue our long history of engaging 
at all levels of Embassy Abidjan with various religious communities to 
demonstrate U.S. support for religious tolerance. I will also use 
public diplomacy, including around religious holidays, to demonstrate 
respect for all faiths.

    Question. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the U.N., including in elections 
for specialized bodies like the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who if 
elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. 
She is in a tough race that will require early, consistent engagement 
across capitals and within the U.N. member states.

   If confirmed, do you commit to demarching the Cote d'Ivoire 
        Government and any other counterparts necessary to encourage 
        their support of Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to demarching the Government of Cote 
d'Ivoire and others in support of Ms. Bogdan-Martin. It is vital that 
we continue to engage on behalf of American candidates in multilateral 
institutions.

    Question. If confirmed, how can you work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify, recruit, 
and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior Program 
Officer (JPO) program at the U.N.?

    Answer. I have always encouraged Americans of all backgrounds to 
pursue work in the international community, recruiting new members of 
the U.S. Foreign Service while also encouraging opportunities to serve 
in the U.N. and in other international organizations. If confirmed, I 
will continue to recruit and mentor to retain excellent officers in our 
unique careers. I have extensive experience coordinating with the IO 
Bureau to advocate for U.S. candidates in senior positions in the U.N. 
and its specialized agencies. At the U.S. Mission to the African Union, 
we used this multilateral platform to advocate for U.S. policy 
priorities and American candidates. If confirmed, I will continue to 
coordinate with the IO Bureau to encourage Americans to secure more 
opportunities at every level of the U.N. and its specialized agencies. 
I will also continue to recruit Americans to serve internationally, 
including through the U.N. Junior Program Officer program, to have more 
American leaders in these organizations that are vital to advancing 
U.S. interests.

    Question. Cote d'Ivoire has a low rate of voting coincidence with 
the U.S. in the U.N. General Assembly and in the Security Council. What 
is your assessment of this issue?

    Answer. Although African states find themselves in a difficult 
situation when it comes to voting patterns, this is a problematic trend 
that must be addressed through relationship building, increased 
bilateral ties, and effective short- and long-term messaging. Cote 
d'Ivoire was one of very few African countries to vote at least three 
times with the United States on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, 
demonstrating courage and conviction.

    Question. If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to 
engage with the Government on anticipated votes in the U.N. system that 
would increase their voting coincidence with the U.S.?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will engage the Government of Cote d'Ivoire 
to deepen our partnership on multilateral priorities, including 
upcoming votes in the U.N. system. I will foster initiatives designed 
to improve trust and relationships between the Government of Cote 
d'Ivoire and U.S. leadership in Abidjan, New York, and Washington, D.C.

               to Jessica Davis Ba by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. With their absolute control of 
Chinese society and industry, the CCP could stop all of these 
destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the Chinese Communist Party a threat to the United States?

    Answer. Certain activities by the People's Republic of China (PRC) 
and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) represent a challenge to U.S. 
economic, political, and security interests globally and on the African 
continent. The PRC has used its influence abroad in ways that undermine 
laws, agreements, and institutions which has the effect of undermining 
rule of law and democratic principles. Our engagement with Africa is 
neither influenced by, nor a reaction to, China or any other third 
party. The U.S. Strategy Toward Africa recognizes the tremendous 
opportunities that exist to advance shared interests alongside our 
African partners. Secretary Blinken said on May 26, we will invest, 
align, and compete with the PRC to defend our interests and build our 
vision for the future. If confirmed, I will invest in our partnership 
with Cote d'Ivoire; align our concerns, including by highlighting the 
risks associated with PRC engagement that could impact Cote d'Ivoire's 
security, democracy, and sovereignty and U.S. interests. I will ensure 
that our vision of regional security and prosperity provides the basis 
for a positive U.S.-Cote d'Ivoire partnership that competes 
successfully with the type of relationship offered by the PRC.

    Question. Does the Chinese Communist Party undertake any activities 
that are beneficial to U.S. interests?

    Answer. We are prepared to work together with the People's Republic 
of China (PRC) where our interests intersect, in Cote d'Ivoire and 
elsewhere, and where it is essential for global peace and prosperity. 
Issues like climate change, the global drug trade, and COVID-19 
directly threaten our prosperity and security, and we need to work with 
the PRC--just as much as the PRC needs to work with us--to solve these 
problems without borders. This is especially true in Cote d'Ivoire.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China in 
Cote d'Ivoire?

    Answer. If confirmed, I am prepared to work together with the 
People's Republic of China (PRC) where our interests intersect in Cote 
d'Ivoire and remain in line with core U.S. values, including where it 
is essential for global peace and prosperity. Issues like climate 
change, the global drug trade, and COVID-19 directly threaten our 
prosperity and security, and we need to work with the PRC--just as much 
as the PRC needs to work with us--to solve these problems without 
borders. As Secretary Blinken has said, we cannot allow the 
disagreements that divide us stop us from moving forward on the 
priorities that demand that we work together, for the good of our 
people and for the good of the world.

    Question. Cote d'Ivoire, like other African countries, is dependent 
on food imports from Russia and Ukraine. While the United States has 
diligently worked to release Ukrainian grain through means other than 
Black Sea ports currently under Russian attack, Cote d'Ivoire and other 
countries are struggling with the impact of reduced food resources. 
Cote d'Ivoire also uses Chinese technology for digital surveillance, 
raising human rights concerns.

   How do you assess Cote d'Ivoire's efforts to secure reliable 
        sources of food for its people?

    Answer. Ivoirian authorities have imposed a set of temporary 
measures to control rising living costs and improve food security, 
including price ceilings on staple foods and a suspension of custom 
duties on wheat imports. These measures will mostly benefit the poorest 
Ivoirians, who spend a larger share of their incomes on essential 
goods. Also, the above actions will enable Cote d'Ivoire to source food 
from different places; however, with commodity prices expected to 
remain high into 2023, further measures by the government to respond to 
the rising cost of food and inflation may be necessary.

    Question. How would you highlight to Cote d'Ivoire's Government the 
dangers of using Chinese technology?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will emphasize American technology and 
other options for the Government of Cote d'Ivoire to consider as it 
expands its infrastructure to meet the needs of the Ivoirian people. We 
know the People's Republic of China is determined to become the world's 
technology leader by any means necessary and has a well-resourced and 
comprehensive plan to achieve that ambition. The State Department is 
working with allies and partners to build secure, resilient, and 
diverse supply chains; to protect sensitive technologies, data, and 
critical infrastructure; and to ensure strategic competitors cannot 
exploit our own innovative ecosystems to gain military or national 
security advantage.

    Question. What would be the impact to the United States of a 
prolonged food security crisis in Cote d'Ivoire and the rest of sub-
Saharan Africa?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with public and private sector 
partners and across U.S. Government agencies to help Cote d'Ivoire 
avert a prolonged food security crisis. Cote d'Ivoire has been 
experiencing a level of political stability for the past decade that 
has enabled the country to make great economic progress and effectively 
address the country's once daunting food insecurity and malnutrition 
issues. A prolonged food security crisis could result in loss of life 
and productivity and endanger Cote d'Ivoire's stability, making it more 
vulnerable to insecurity, democratic backsliding, and malign influence. 
A food security crisis would result in an increased need for 
humanitarian and development assistance, which could then put a higher 
burden on the United States as one of the Cote d'Ivoire's most 
important partners to advance sustainable development goals. Likewise, 
much of the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa could see similar struggles with 
a prolonged food security crisis precipitating more instability in the 
region and loss of previous food security and nutrition gains. A result 
could be increased needs for humanitarian assistance as well as other 
unforeseen consequences of increased food security-related instability.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to ensure that Cote 
d'Ivoire reduces its dependence on Russia for food and fertilizer so 
that it is more resilient to food shocks in the future?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will prioritize partnerships to strengthen 
the agricultural sector that supports the livelihoods of millions of 
Ivoirians. Investments by the United States through initiatives like 
the McGovern-Dole school program in Cote d'Ivoire, which feeds over 
125,000 children in rural northern areas every day, help reduce 
dependence on Russia. Resiliency to food shocks begins with consistent 
programming that meets essential food security needs and draws from a 
state's agricultural strengths. If confirmed, I will seek to develop 
and expand programs that harness and build upon Cote d'Ivoire's most 
traditional food crops, such as yam, cassava, and plantains, that are 
geared towards increasing domestic food production and security. Cote 
d'Ivoire has tremendous potential to become a net food exporter, and I 
will work to identify productive partnership opportunities to further 
the United States' interests.

    Question. The State Department has a number of posts in its Bureau 
of African Affairs that are classified as ``historically difficult to 
staff''; if confirmed, how would you engage the Foreign Service 
workforce to encourage qualified individuals to serve in Abidjan or 
other posts in Africa?

    Answer. I believe that the best work comes from well-resourced 
teams that support one another towards achieving common goals and 
advancing U.S. policies. Embassy Abidjan has experienced rapid growth 
in the last two years, presenting additional challenges as the post 
also continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic. If confirmed, I 
will work across the interagency and with Washington to ensure that 
future growth meets U.S. strategic objectives and can be supported 
effectively by post's management platform.
    The Bureau of African affairs continues to engage with the 
Department at the highest levels to improve incentives for working at 
our most difficult posts, including Abidjan. Throughout my State 
Department career, I have valued and created a diverse and inclusive 
work environment where every member of our team has the opportunities 
to contribute to our shared goals. If confirmed, I will work with my 
colleagues in Abidjan and Washington to nourish such an environment and 
recruit from a diverse and inclusive talent pool--the best that the 
State Department has to offer. If confirmed, I will continue to support 
efforts to ensure meaningful family employment at Embassy Abidjan, 
which helps with recruitment, morale, and to close staffing gaps at 
this historically difficult to staff post.

    Question. With Cote d'Ivoire as a signatory to Beijing's Belt and 
Road initiative, how do you see the trade relationship evolving between 
Beijing and Abidjan?

    Answer. If confirmed, one of my highest priorities will be to 
deepen the trade relationship between the United States and Cote 
d'Ivoire. The role of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in Cote 
d'Ivoire's economy is growing and the Government of Cote d'Ivoire 
welcomes investment, including from the PRC. Cote d'Ivoire imports 
nearly $2.3 billion worth of PRC goods a year but exports only about 
$576 million in Ivoirian goods to the PRC, mostly raw rubber. Ivoirian 
complaints regarding PRC-Cote d'Ivoire trade mainly concern the quality 
of PRC workmanship and the lack of technology transfer. In addition, 
there is evidence that increased Chinese activity has led to a greater 
demand for trafficked animals. The Ivoirians recently rejected a PRC 
overture to begin negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), as 
officials worried it would disturb Cote d'Ivoire's relationship with 
ECOWAS. I will work with our interagency team and Washington to 
leverage U.S. Government tools to support American companies to 
demonstrate best practices and to make trade with the United States 
more attractive than our competitors.
    President Ouattara and his ministers openly welcome American 
investment. They remain very pro-American but are pragmatic considering 
the country's massive need for foreign direct investment (FDI), 
resulting in an open-for-business attitude towards the PRC and others. 
If confirmed, I will continue to support the expansion of U.S. 
investment in Cote d'Ivoire to provide an alternative to PRC offers.

    Question. What kinds of opportunities and potential do you see for 
American companies within the Ivoirian private sector, and where should 
we first focus our efforts?

    Answer. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire is eager for more U.S. 
private sector investment. With total bilateral trade in 2021 almost 
$1.6 billion, Cote d'Ivoire is currently the United States' largest 
francophone Africa trading partner, and the United States is Cote 
d'Ivoire's fifth largest trading partner. The most promising areas for 
U.S. investment are currently in energy, including renewables, 
construction equipment and material, agro-processing, agricultural 
services and products, and telecommunication equipment and services.
    Opportunities in the energy sector are abundant. Cote d'Ivoire has 
oil and gas reserves and has also committed to increase renewable 
energy generation to 42 percent by 2030. The Ivoirian Government is 
also focused on expanding infrastructure projects to make the country's 
economic growth more inclusive and not focused on the Abidjan area in 
the South. Finally, Cote d'Ivoire's leadership is anxious to improve 
the value chain capabilities for the country's massive output of 
agricultural products. The U.S. Government can use tools such as 
Prosper Africa to support U.S. and Ivoirian businesses in this area. 
Secretary Blinken met with Ivoirian Prime Minister Patrick Achi in 
March 2022 to discuss ways in which the United States and Cote d'Ivoire 
can strengthen the bilateral economic partnership. If confirmed, I will 
work closely with private sector partners and the Government of Cote 
d'Ivoire to expand opportunities for U.S. private investment.

    Question. What does Cote d'Ivoire need to do to prevent the spread 
of violent extremism within its borders? What tools and lessons of the 
Global Fragility Act will you draw on to help the Ivoirian Government 
and society become resilient in the face of these challenges?

    Answer. Cote d'Ivoire must take a holistic approach to prevent the 
spread of violent extremism. Security investments alone are 
insufficient. Such an approach should include targeted investments in 
democratic governance, private sector solutions, and social services, 
as well as in the security sector. Cote d'Ivoire's top leaders have 
expressed a commitment to values such as accountability, democratic 
governance, social peace, and earning the support of the population, to 
withstand the strains imposed by violent extremism spreading from the 
country's northern neighbors, especially Mali and Burkina Faso. Cote 
d'Ivoire has taken progressive steps to invest in the north through new 
social programs focused on youth, major infrastructure development, and 
expanding the presence of security forces in at-risk areas for 
terrorist attacks.
    If confirmed, I will work with various Ivoirian Government and 
civil society stakeholders to ensure that the U.S. Strategy to Prevent 
Conflict and Promote Stability (SPCPS), under the Global Fragility Act, 
is aligned with Cote d'Ivoire's National Development Plan and 
facilitates meaningful government-community cooperation. Specifically, 
the tools offered by the SPCPS can reinforce local and national early 
warning systems and action plans to prevent the spread of violent 
extremism; support existing community-led platforms, such as civilian-
military committees to foster trust between marginalized communities 
and security forces; professionalize law enforcement and other 
government officials to engender trust with the communities they serve; 
and strengthen legal capabilities to hold violent extremist actors 
accountable.
    If confirmed, I will encourage the Government to continue these 
efforts and to explore opportunities, including with the private 
sector, for partnerships to expand services and livelihoods. I will 
lead our interagency team in Abidjan to use all of our diplomatic, 
development, and defense tools to support the Government's efforts to 
build resilience to violent extremism in the northern region and 
throughout the country.

        Submitted to Hon. Lucy Tamlyn by Senator Robert Menendez

    Question. Is DRC on track to hold elections in 2023 as required?

    Answer. Under prevailing conditions, there is no reason why free 
and fair elections cannot be held as scheduled in December 2023 in 
accordance with the DRC's constitutional deadline. Some important steps 
have been taken, but Congolese officials across the country will have 
to accelerate preparations--both technical and political--over the next 
several months to ensure the elections are free and fair including in 
eastern DRC.
    The DRC conducted gubernatorial elections in May in 14 of 26 
provinces, which were largely peaceful and included accredited national 
and international observers, including U.S. Embassy staff and 
representatives from other diplomatic missions. This election was an 
encouraging, if limited, sign for the ability of DRC authorities to 
conduct elections in December 2023. In June, the DRC parliament adopted 
revisions to the DRC's 2006 electoral law, but measures aimed at 
ensuring transparency in 2023 and preventing the irregularities that 
marred previous election cycles failed to pass. Key issues in the 
process ahead include voter registration, the identification of the 
voting centers, publication of the electoral calendar, the 
appropriation and release of an adequate budget, and invitation and 
accreditation of electoral observers. While there is no doubt that 
greater progress needs to be made, particularly on political measures, 
there is still time for free and fair elections to be held.

    Question. What is the U.S. doing to support timely, credible, 
transparent, and peaceful elections in DRC in 2023?

    Answer. One of the Administration's top policy priorities in the 
DRC is to support long-term stability through free and fair elections. 
The Department continues to press the DRC Government and National 
Independent Electoral Commission (CENI) to adhere to the planned 
electoral timeline, to maximize opportunities to be transparent on 
electoral processes and outcomes, and to ensure an open political 
environment for the Congolese people to express their views peacefully. 
Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Molly Phee and Acting Assistant 
Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) Lisa Peterson 
both stressed this message in meetings with CENI President Denis Kadima 
during a visit to Washington, D.C. in late February.
    We are employing the full range of foreign policy tools in support 
of the elections in 2023. This includes international pressure in 
coordination with European and African partners as well as the U.N.; 
public messaging; diplomatic engagement, including senior-level visits; 
and technical assistance to support a transparent and credible process. 
DRL is actively expanding its suite of human rights and democracy 
programs in the DRC to lay the groundwork for increased citizen 
participation in and understanding of the electoral process. Total U.S. 
Government support for the elections and election observation is over 
$13 million.

    Question. How are these activities different from what we did in 
2018, when U.S. support for domestic election observers and other 
election support activity did not result in a timely, transparent, or 
credible process?

    Answer. Unlike in 2018, President Tshisekedi and his top aides have 
publicly committed to conducting free and fair elections in accordance 
with constitutional deadlines. Although there are deficiencies, the 
current President of the National Independent Electoral Commission 
(CENI) Denis Kadima has also committed to well-managed elections in 
2023 that are free and fair.
    Embassy Kinshasa and other U.S. representatives have consistently 
messaged that the United States expects the DRC to conduct elections in 
accordance with constitutional deadlines that are free and fair and 
that reflect the will of the Congolese people. The United States is 
working alongside other likeminded countries to ensure a consistent 
message on the importance of these elections to help consolidate DRC's 
democratic transition. USAID is providing technical support to CENI, 
countering disinformation, and improving access to accurate information 
about electoral processes, and supporting civil society led civic and 
voter education. USAID is also readying plans to assist independent 
domestic and international observation efforts to improve confidence in 
the integrity of the outcomes. The United States has also encouraged 
President Tshisekedi to make a formal request to the United Nations to 
provide logistical and technical support to the elections.

    Question. Will you commit to briefing the committee on your 
election strategy 90 days after arriving at Post, if confirmed?

    Answer. Yes, I will work with the Bureau of Legislative Affairs to 
keep the committee apprised of developments.

    Question. Under former President Kabila, the DRC was characterized 
by human rights abuses, corruption, and impunity. President Tshisekedi 
vowed to address these issues. Three years later, however, several 
senior military officers responsible for gross violations of human 
rights remain at their posts and corruption again appears rampant.
    Has the human rights situation and fight against corruption and 
impunity improved since the 2018 elections?

    Answer. President Tshisekedi has taken steps to promote respect for 
human rights. Since the beginning of his term, he has freed Kabila-era 
political prisoners, promoted respect for human rights, including for 
people living with disabilities and vulnerable persons, and affirmed 
the freedom of peaceful assembly. In July 2022, the Government of the 
DRC promulgated a new law on the protection of Indigenous Peoples' 
rights. In 2020, the DRC achieved the ranking of Tier 2 Watch List in 
the annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report after making key 
achievements that year. Despite enormous institutional hurdles, 
including limited awareness of TIP and an ineffective judicial system, 
DRC's law enforcement and victim protection authorities have secured 
important victories in the fight against human trafficking. In the past 
two years, the Government broke up a transnational child trafficking 
ring, convicted perpetrators of sex trafficking in Kinshasa, and 
launched a national TIP awareness campaign. The Congolese military 
(FARDC) has taken significant and successful strides to eliminate the 
recruitment and use of children in its ranks.
    Significant challenges do remain in the DRC, but unlike during the 
Kabila era, the United States is the Tshisekedi administration's 
partner of choice, and it is aware that our partnership relies on 
respect for human rights.

    Question. What actions will you take if confirmed to make it clear 
to the DRC Government that respect for human rights and the rule of law 
are essential for DRC's future and DRC's ability to partner with the 
U.S. and U.S. companies looking to invest in DRC?

    Answer. If confirmed, advancing the protection of human rights and 
the rule of law would be among my highest priorities. We know that 
allegations of human rights violations and abuses and corruption eat 
away at any prospects for the DRC to emerge as a prosperous and stable 
country. Respect for human rights and a strong focus on anti-corruption 
efforts are in the DRC's interest. Embassy Kinshasa has consistently 
stressed the importance of respecting human rights, including freedom 
of expression (including for members of the press) and the right of 
peaceful assembly. For eastern DRC especially, the Embassy has 
continually and strongly urged armed groups and Congolese security 
forces to end all human rights violations and abuses, end all attacks 
on civilians, and ensure that those responsible for such acts be held 
accountable. The United States and the DRC also held its first 
bilateral Human Rights Dialogue in 2021. If confirmed, I would continue 
partnering closely with the DRC Government to make progress on these 
key issues.

    Question. Preserving what is left of the Congo forest basin is 
essential for the health of our planet. The DRC Government has 
previously emerged as a leader in Africa on preservation of the 
environment. In July, however, the DRC Government announced its 
intention to sell 30 oil blocks in forested areas. If drilling occurs 
in these areas, it could release disastrous amounts of carbon into the 
atmosphere. Until recently the DRC Government appeared committed to 
preserving the environment and the Congo forest basin which is home to 
rainforest, peat bogs, and carbon sinks essential for the health of the 
planet. In July however the DRC Government's policy seemed to shift 
with the announcement of the sale of 30 oil and gas prospecting blocks 
throughout the rainforest.

   How do you explain this shift?

    Answer. The DRC Government is attempting to balance achieving long-
term global climate goals such as their COP26 commitments with 
addressing immediate pressing development needs including poverty and 
hunger. Embassy Kinshasa is discussing the auction of the oil and gas 
prospecting blocks with the Ministry of Hydrocarbons, the Ministry of 
the Environment, and the Presidency, urging that verifiable 
environmental impact assessments be conducted prior to any oil 
exploration. In the past, the Government has acknowledged the potential 
for oil in these sensitive areas but has foregone plans to exploit 
potential reserves in the interest of the environment. Embassy Kinshasa 
is hoping to partner with the DRC to pursue alternative development 
pathways that help secure improved livelihoods for the Congolese people 
and help DRC meet its climate and environmental commitments.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to work with the Congolese 
to balance the necessary preservation of what is left of Congo Forest 
basin and the DRC's economic development objectives and needs?

    Answer. In February 2021, in line with President Biden's 
prioritization of combatting the climate crisis, the U.S.-DRC 
Privileged Partnership for Peace and Prosperity added ``Preservation of 
the Environment'' to its core pillars. To advance his environmental 
agenda, President Tshisekedi elevated the position of Minister of the 
Environment and Sustainable Development to one of four Vice-Prime 
Minister positions in the cabinet. To this role he appointed Eve 
Bazaiba, an experienced activist and politician.
    The DRC could contribute significantly to the fight against climate 
change if it follows President Tshisekedi's declared intention to take 
bold steps to combat deforestation and strengthen environmental 
protections. The DRC is home to 47 percent of Africa's tropical 
rainforests. The U.S. Government has a wide range of programs across 
agencies to support both the necessary conservation of the Congo Basin 
forest and the DRC's economic development objectives and needs. A few 
examples include the SilvaCarbon program, jointly funded with the 
Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development 
(USAID) and implemented by the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Geological 
Survey, and other agencies which mobilizes private sector finance for 
activities aligned with forest conservation and restoration, including 
through carbon markets and results-based payments programs; USAID's 
Central African Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE) that 
focuses on using a people-centered approach to biodiversity and habitat 
protection, using protected areas (PAs) as anchors for sustainable 
development, fostering public private partnerships (PPPs) for PA 
management, and leveraging natural capital to promote green economies; 
and the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA), a 
multi-stakeholder forum created in 2011 to support the creation of 
conflict-free supply chains from the DRC/Great Lakes region. The United 
States also engages with other like-minded donor countries through the 
Congo Basin Forest Partnership, which helps coordinate conservation and 
sustainable management of Congo Basin forest ecosystems.
    If confirmed, I will leverage these programs and others to work 
with the Congolese to balance the necessary preservation of sensitive 
areas of the Congo Forest basin and the DRC's economic development 
objectives and needs.

    Question. The recent re-emergence of the M23 rebel group has 
significantly destabilized eastern DRC. In June, the U.N. peacekeeping 
mission (MONUSCO) reported that the M23 is surprisingly well armed and 
may outgun U.N. peacekeepers. U.N. experts reported that Rwandan troops 
are operating alongside M23 inside DRC. In addition to executing 
civilians and displacing tens of thousands, the group has shot down a 
U.N. helicopter, killing U.N. troops. MONUSCO's inability to 
effectively contain M23 has heightened tensions between MONUSCO, the 
Congolese people and the Congolese Government resulting in the tragic 
deaths of civilians and U.N. peacekeepers.

   The last time M23 emerged in DRC, in 2012, they did so with Rwandan 
        support. Do you agree that Rwandan support for M23 or the 
        presence of Rwandan troops inside DRC is unacceptable?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. If confirmed, should the United States speak out publicly 
against Rwanda's support for the M23 and the presence of Rwandan troops 
in DRC?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. What steps is the Administration taking to reduce 
tensions between MONUSCO and the Congolese, and bolster MONUSCO's 
effectiveness with regard to combatting armed groups and providing 
civilian protection?

    Answer. I am deeply concerned that recent anti-MONUSCO protests 
have turned violent and included attacks on MONUSCO facilities and 
resulted in peacekeeper and protester casualties. At the same time, I 
was appalled by the July 31 shooting of civilians by peacekeepers in 
Kasindi and welcomed the Secretary-General's swift response and strong 
statement calling for accountability. MONUSCO is by no means perfect, 
but it is an essential part of creating conditions for peace in eastern 
DRC.
    For decades, the people of eastern DRC have suffered violence and 
insecurity, primarily perpetrated in recent years by armed groups and 
sometimes by DRC's own security forces. Corrupt networks have profited 
from the illicit exploitation of the region's natural resources. 
Currently, the M23 armed group with reported backing by the Government 
of Rwanda is controlling territory near the Uganda border and killing 
civilians. Addressing the current crisis, and the long-standing 
underlying issues including the role of DRC's neighbors, is a priority 
for the State Department. The State Department has maintained steady 
engagement with senior host nation officials as well as key partners to 
encourage de-escalation of regional tensions, the termination of the 
M23 offensive, and progress on the demobilization of all armed groups. 
Secretary Blinken visited Kinshasa August 9-10 and Kigali August 10-11, 
following Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield's travel August 4-5 to Uganda. 
The Bureau of African Affairs' Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary 
Massinga discussed this issue in depth with the Foreign Ministers of 
the DRC, Rwanda, and Angola at the African Union (AU) mid-year 
coordination meeting in Lusaka from July 17-18. Our key message is 
reinforcing the need to respect the DRC's territorial integrity and to 
terminate any proxy support to armed groups on all sides. The United 
States is supportive of the African-led mediation efforts, which have 
provided important venues for direct discussions among regional heads 
of state. If confirmed, I will work closely with Washington to ensure 
that our engagement in Bujumbura, Kampala, Kigali, and elsewhere is 
coordinated and responds to the regional dynamics that have long 
influenced the crisis.
    MONUSCO has an important role to play in improving the situation. 
The U.N. Mission continues to carry out its mandate for the protection 
of civilians. If confirmed, I look forward to frequent interactions 
with MONUSCO leadership and close coordination with USUN as plans for 
the Mission's transition move forward.

    Question. Will you commit to briefing the committee 30 days after 
you arrive at post on your assessment as to Rwandan presence in eastern 
Congo and its support for the M23 along with your recommendations for a 
set of diplomatic interventions to address such if confirmed?

    Answer. Yes, I will work with the Bureau of Legislative Affairs to 
keep the committee apprised of developments.

    Question. The DRC has vast critical mineral reserves, with reserves 
of cobalt, a necessary component of batteries. As we turn to new 
technologies like electric vehicles, which require batteries, to 
address the worsening climate crisis, we face new security risks as 
China controls significant parts of clean energy supply chain. I am 
especially concerned about critical minerals in countries like the DRC, 
as I outlined in a letter I sent to Under Secretary Fernandez back in 
January.

   What has State done to address the issues outlined in the letter I 
        sent in January about concerns with Chinese monopolization of 
        critical minerals in the DRC?

    Answer. The Department shares your concerns regarding the issues 
identified in your letter, including the People's Republic of China's 
(PRC) concentrated influence over mining and processing of clean-energy 
minerals. In May 2021, President Tshisekedi announced his intention to 
review mining deals with the PRC that include unfavorable terms for the 
DRC. This is an ongoing process, and the United States has informed the 
DRC Government of our support for its decision to review contracts and 
pursue greater accountability in the sector. Economic development 
should promote democratic governance, respect for human rights, and 
transparency. The United States is providing more than $30 million in 
assistance to help the DRC promote responsible and sustainable mining 
practices and is actively looking at new engagements in the sector.
    To elevate bilateral diplomacy around critical minerals, the State 
Department has worked closely with other agencies and encouraged them 
to engage with the DRC. In the past year, high-level delegations from 
the National Security Council, Department of Labor, and Department of 
the Treasury have visited the DRC to engage on critical minerals. 
Additionally, during a visit to Washington, DC by DRC Minister of Mines 
Antoinette N'Samba Kalambayi in mid-March, Under Secretary of State for 
Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Jose Fernandez signed with 
the Minister a Memorandum of Understanding for the Department's Bureau 
of Energy Resources to support Congolese efforts to strengthen sector 
governance and predictability for investors and maximize benefits of 
mineral resource development for the Congolese people.
    We echo the long-standing calls from African capitals that PRC 
actions must respect host country laws, particularly regarding human 
and labor rights, the rule of law, and protections for the environment. 
I am confident that, in a level playing field, U.S. companies will be a 
partner of choice for the DRC. By elevating environmental, social, and 
governance standards and advancing mining-sector reforms in key 
countries, we aim to reduce the advantage gained by PRC companies that 
benefit from lax standards. By focusing on the entire supply chain, 
from mining to refining and processing to end uses, as well as 
recycling, we provide a holistic approach to securing the critical 
minerals needed for the energy transition. Finally, through increased 
information sharing, attention to financing, and minerals-focused 
diplomacy and commercial engagement, we are taking a forward-looking 
rather than reactive approach to working with likeminded countries with 
collective interests toward countering PRC influence and meeting 
climate and sustainability goals.

    Question. What are the most important actions you have taken in 
your career to date to support democracy and human rights? What has 
been the impact of your actions?

    Answer. As Ambassador in Benin, I used my access to senior 
government officials to highlight growing limitations on freedom of 
expression, including for members of the press, and to advocate for a 
regulatory framework which would not disadvantage the independent 
media. As Ambassador in the Central African Republic, I worked closely 
with a group of like-minded countries and institutions to warn against 
efforts to amend the constitution prior to the 2020 elections which 
could have potentially extended the term of the incumbent president. As 
Charge d'Affaires in Sudan, I repeatedly urged the highest authorities 
to release opposition leaders held under questionable detention terms, 
cease violence against protestors, and investigate allegations of 
gender-based violence. These actions made clear to the host country 
interlocutors the importance of respect for human rights and democracy 
for advancing our partnership with the country in question and sent a 
clear message to human rights defenders that we would stand with them.

    Question. What issues are the most pressing challenges to democracy 
or democratic development in DRC? These challenges might include 
obstacles to participatory and accountable governance and institutions, 
rule of law, authentic political competition, civil society, human 
rights, and press freedom. Please be as specific as possible.

    Answer. The most pressing challenge to democracy and democratic 
development in the DRC is the protracted insecurity in the East. It is 
the overriding concern of the DRC Government and public with increased 
calls from civil society for greater U.S. engagement. In May 2021, to 
deliver on his promise to restore security in eastern DRC, President 
Tshisekedi declared a ``State of Siege''--effectively martial law--in 
two of the most troubled provinces, North Kivu and Ituri, installing 
military governors and ramping up Congolese military (FARDC) operations 
against ISIS-DRC and armed groups in the region. Reports of human 
rights violations and abuses have accompanied the State of Siege. The 
U.N. and human rights groups have documented continued violations 
including extrajudicial killings by FARDC and police while military 
governments have restricted civil society and political activists and 
prosecuted some for criticizing the State of Siege. Despite President 
Tshisekedi's efforts to pursue constructive relationships with eastern 
neighbors, the resurgence of the March 23 Movement (M23) armed group 
with reported backing by the Government of Rwanda has strained DRC-
Rwanda relations to crisis levels. The U.N. Stabilization Mission in 
the DRC (MONUSCO) and other stakeholders' efforts have been 
insufficient to stem the persistent armed conflict. Amid growing 
tensions over regional conflict, violent protests in late July have 
resulted in deaths of MONUSCO peacekeepers and demonstrators alike amid 
belated calls for calm from Congolese authorities.
    Responsibility for organizing the presidential and parliamentary 
elections due by the end of 2023 falls on the DRC's National 
Independent Electoral Commission (CENI). Preparations are late in large 
part due to the delayed formation of a new CENI leadership team. A new 
CENI board took office in October 2021 led by President Denis Kadima. 
Since his appointment, Kadima has earned cautious praise from erstwhile 
opponents for frank and open communication and indications of 
independence, but broader concerns on CENI management and integrity 
persist. A revised electoral law promulgated in July includes slight 
improvements for transparency and gender; however, a series of broader 
proposed reforms were rejected by Tshisekedi's Sacred Union 
supermajority, further fanning opposition concerns about electoral 
process.

    Question. What steps will you take--if confirmed--to support 
democracy in DRC? What do you hope to accomplish through these actions? 
What are the potential impediments to addressing the specific obstacles 
you have identified?

    Answer. We know that democracy is more than just free and fair 
elections and we are employing the full range of foreign policy tools 
in support of the elections in 2023 given their critical importance to 
the DRC's democratic trajectory. This includes international pressure 
in coordination with European and African partners as well as the U.N.; 
public messaging; diplomatic engagement, including senior-level visits; 
and technical assistance to support a transparent and credible process. 
The Department continues to press the DRC Government and National 
Independent Electoral Commission (CENI) to adhere to the planned 
electoral timeline, to maximize opportunities to be transparent on 
electoral processes and outcomes, and to ensure an open political 
environment for the Congolese people to express their views peacefully. 
Secretary Blinken also stressed the need for free, fair, transparent, 
and on-time election during his visit. Assistant Secretary for African 
Affairs Molly Phee and Acting Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human 
Rights, and Labor (DRL) Lisa Peterson both stressed this message in 
meetings with CENI President Denis Kadima during his visit to 
Washington, DC in late February.
    DRL is actively expanding its suite of human rights and democracy 
programs in the DRC to lay the groundwork for increased citizen 
participation in and understanding of the electoral process. Ensuring 
the success of commitments on the elections process will require 
sustained attention to financial logistical technical and political 
challenges. USAID is the largest donor working in elections and is 
currently the only donor providing technical support to CENI. Recently 
USAID announced $13 million to finance international and domestic 
election observation and other election activities. More broadly, the 
Department seeks to engage the DRC on supporting its democratic 
aspirations through its participation in the Summit for Democracy, the 
U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, and bilateral Human Rights Dialogue.
    If confirmed, I will leverage and expand these efforts where 
possible to support democracy in DRC. Through these actions, I hope to 
see DRC on a positive trajectory that enables it to realize its 
democracy and its vast potential for the benefit of the Congolese and 
American people, as well as Central Africa and the world.

    Question. How will you utilize U.S. Government assistance resources 
at your disposal, including the Democracy Commission Small Grants 
program and other sources of State Department and USAID funding, to 
support democracy and governance, and what will you prioritize in 
processes to administer such assistance?

    Answer. U.S. Government assistance resources, including the 
Democracy Commission Small Grants program and other sources of State 
Department and USAID funding, are important tools to support democracy, 
human rights, and governance (DRG). DRG programs strengthen the ability 
of the Government of the DRC and civil society organizations to deliver 
basic services, mobilize domestic resources, and encourage greater 
citizen participation in political processes. U.S. assistance supports 
free and fair elections, improves transparent and accountable 
government processes and rule of law, and improves access to 
information so that citizens may participate fully in the democratic 
process and make more informed decisions. DRG programs contribute to 
citizen's empowerment to hold institutions accountable and 
effectiveness of public and private institutions to deliver public 
services. If confirmed, I will leverage these resources to support 
democracy, respect for human rights, and good governance. If confirmed, 
my priorities will include strengthening transparency and electoral 
administration; improving civic and voter education; empowering the 
population, including women and youth, to meaningfully participate in 
elections; and helping marginalized communities to understand and 
access political processes.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to meet with civil society 
members, human rights, and other non-governmental organizations in the 
U.S. and with local human rights NGOs, and other members of civil 
society in DRC? What steps will you take to pro-actively address 
efforts to restrict or penalize NGOs and civil society via legal or 
regulatory measures?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to meet with civil society members, 
human rights, and other NGOs in the United States, and with local human 
rights NGOs and other members of civil society in DRC.
    Embassy Kinshasa regularly meets and engages with NGOs and civil 
society groups, hosting roundtables and leveraging these relationships 
for outreach and to advance policy goals. Embassy Kinshasa has 
continually engaged with counterparts in Ministries of Human Rights, 
Justice, Defense, Interior, and Communications to discuss human rights 
issues, including freedom of expression (including for members of the 
press) and the right of peaceful assembly. If confirmed, I will 
continue this engagement and expand where possible to proactively 
address any efforts by the DRC Government to restrict or penalize NGOs 
and civil society via legal or regulatory measures.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to meet with democratically 
oriented political opposition figures and parties? What steps will you 
take to encourage genuine political competition? Will you advocate for 
access and inclusivity for women, minorities, and youth within 
political parties?

    Answer. Embassy Kinshasa regularly meets with democratically 
oriented political opposition figures and parties, both to seek their 
perspectives and to make clear that the U.S. priority is for the DRC to 
conduct free and fair elections that reflect the will of the Congolese 
people in accordance with constitutional deadlines. Embassy Kinshasa 
has also continually engaged with relevant ministries to advocate for 
specific measures to encourage genuine political competition, including 
revisions to the electoral law aimed at ensuring transparency and the 
invitation and accreditation of electoral observers. Total U.S. 
Government support for the elections and election observation is over 
$13 million.
    If confirmed, I commit to continuing these efforts and expand them 
where possible, and to meet with democratically oriented political 
opposition figures and parties. If confirmed, I will advocate for 
access and inclusivity for women, minorities, and youth within 
political parties.

    Question. Will you and your embassy team actively engage with DRC 
on freedom of the press and address any government efforts designed to 
control or undermine press freedom through legal, regulatory, or other 
measures? Will you commit to meeting regularly with independent, local 
press in DRC?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will actively engage alongside my embassy 
team with DRC on freedom of expression, including for members of the 
press, and address any government efforts designed to control or 
undermine press freedom through legal, regulatory, or other measures. 
If confirmed, I commit to meeting regularly with independent, local 
press in DRC.

    Question. Will you and your embassy team actively engage with civil 
society and government counterparts on countering disinformation and 
propaganda disseminated by foreign state or non-state actors in the 
country?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. Will you commit to using your position, if confirmed, to 
defend the human rights and dignity of all people in DRC, no matter 
their sexual orientation or gender identity?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. What challenges do the lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people face in DRC?

    Answer. Legally, LGBTQI+ status or conduct is not criminalized in 
the DRC, but the law also does not expressly protect LGBTQI+ persons; 
some LGBTQI+ persons have been subjected to selective enforcement of 
``public indecency'' mechanisms that are not applied to heterosexual 
adults. Authorities rarely take steps to investigate, prosecute, or 
punish officials who committed violence or abuse against LGBTQI+ 
persons, whether in the security forces or elsewhere in the Government.
    Freedom of association for members of the LGBTQI+ community is 
poorly guaranteed. Activists have noted that the process for 
registering NGOs was burdensome and very slow, and LGBTQI+ groups were 
denied registration. LGBTQI+ activists assert that other human rights 
organizations exclude LGBTQI+ rights organizations, due either to 
religious belief or a belief that LGBTQI+ rights are not human rights.
    LGBTQI+ persons are vulnerable within the health system. LGBTQI+ 
activists reported that there were many cases of ``corrective'' rape 
against both men and women. When the survivors went to a health clinic 
for care, they were either rejected for being LGBTQI+ or the staff at 
the health clinic practiced so-called ``conversion therapy'' practices 
and tried to ``dissuade'' them from being LGBTQI+.

    Question. What specifically will you commit to do to help LGBTQ 
people in DRC?

    Answer. In the spirit of ``do no harm'' and ``nothing about us 
without us,'' if confirmed, I will work to ensure Embassy Kinshasa 
consults with members of local LGBTQI+ civil society so that U.S. 
Government efforts will not inadvertently cause backlash or negative 
repercussions for members of the local LGBTQI+ community. If confirmed, 
I commit to promoting respect for human rights, including for members 
of the LGBTQI+ community, with relevant government officials, such as 
the Human Rights Minister and the Minister of the Interior. If 
confirmed, I also commit to engaging with other like-minded Embassies 
to create a coalition that can take steps to advocate for the 
protection and inclusion of members of the LGBTQI+ community, encourage 
the inclusion of LGBTQI+ identity groups in the broader human rights 
community in the DRC, and discuss the human rights of members of the 
LGBTQI+ community with religious leaders.

    Question. Will you commit, if confirmed, to ensuring that you fully 
brief members of congress and/or their staff each time you are in 
Washington for visits or consultations during your tenure as Ambassador 
to DRC?

    Answer. Yes, I will work with the Bureau of Legislative Affairs to 
keep the committee apprised of developments.

    Question. Last week I convened a hearing on the important work of 
the State Department's Chief Diversity Officer and the important role 
diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility efforts play in 
maintaining our countries' competitive edge on the global stage. How do 
you anticipate fostering diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
accessibility at Embassy Kinshasa?

    Answer. In June 2020 Embassy Kinshasa established a Diversity, 
Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Council. A survey conducted 
by the council revealed a desire for increased mentorship at the 
Mission, especially among locally employed staff, as well as concerns 
about weak social and collegial bonds between locally employed staff 
and U.S. Direct Hires (USDH). In response, the DEIA Council created 
programming to bring the community together, using Pride Month as a 
trial run. Since these first steps the DEIA council has strengthened 
locally employed staff unity by assisting with the local staff 
committee leadership elections, as well as strengthened Congolese-
American bonds within the Embassy through new social programming 
focused on sharing local meals and stories. To address the demand for 
mentorship, Embassy Kinshasa instituted a mission-wide mentorship 
program and put an emphasis on greater cross-cultural activities.
    Looking after the safety of the Embassy community and ensuring that 
all American and locally employed staff members can flourish and bring 
their best to the job in an environment where they feel included and 
equal is my highest priority as a leader. If confirmed, I will 
prioritize recruiting and retaining staff to meet our mission's 
objectives, supporting the physical and mental health of the Embassy 
community, and setting expectations for how to accomplish mission 
priorities while maintaining work/life balance. If confirmed, I commit 
to strong two-way communication with all Mission personnel, including 
locally employed staff on this subject.

    Question. What specifically will you do to prioritize and promote 
diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, while also combating 
racism, discrimination, and inequality among locally employed staff in 
DRC?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work closely with Embassy Kinshasa's 
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Council to 
promote their efforts and make clear that combatting racism, 
discrimination, and inequality for all members of the mission is a 
priority for me and my leadership team. If confirmed, I look forward to 
fostering the council's mentorship program and participating in cross-
cultural activities. Ensuring that all members of the mission team can 
flourish and bring their best to the job in an environment where they 
feel included and equal is my highest priority as a leader. If 
confirmed, I commit to strong two-way communication with all Mission 
personnel, including locally employed staff on this subject.

    Question. In addition to focusing on diversity, equity, inclusion, 
and accessibility in our workforce, will you commit to engaging more 
equitably in operations and programming, particularly with potential 
partners and communities that traditionally have been marginalized, 
excluded, or underrepresented in ours and others' donor and partnership 
efforts? How do you anticipate utilizing local expertise, knowledge, 
and capacity to meet our foreign policy goals?

    Answer. Our locally employed staff and other local partners are 
invaluable resources to implement U.S. foreign policy objectives. Their 
local expertise, knowledge, and capacity are essential to understanding 
the dynamics in DRC. If confirmed, I will rely on this expertise to 
maximize our impact. If confirmed, I commit to engaging more equitably 
in operations and programming, particularly with potential partners and 
communities that traditionally have been marginalized, excluded, or 
underrepresented in ours and others' donor and partnership efforts.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
        Submitted to Hon. Lucy Tamlyn by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. What is your perspective on the situation in Eastern 
Congo and the role of the United States in addressing the persistent 
insecurity challenges and complex regional dynamics, both bilaterally 
and through multilateral organizations, namely the U.N. Peacekeeping 
Mission MONUSCO?

    Answer. For decades, the people of eastern DRC have suffered 
violence and insecurity, primarily perpetrated in recent years by armed 
groups and sometimes by DRC's own security forces. Corrupt networks 
have profited from the illicit exploitation of the region's natural 
resources. Currently, the M23 armed group allegedly supported by Rwanda 
is controlling territory near the Uganda border and killing civilians. 
Addressing the current crisis, and the long-standing underlying issues 
including the role of DRC's neighbors, is a priority for the State 
Department. We have maintained steady engagement with senior host 
nation officials as well as key partners to encourage de-escalation of 
regional tensions, the termination of the M23 offensive, and progress 
on the demobilization of all armed groups. Secretary Blinken will visit 
Kinshasa August 9-10 and Kigali August 10-11, following Ambassador 
Thomas-Greenfield's travel August 4-5 to Uganda. The Bureau of African 
Affairs' Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Massinga discussed this 
issue in depth with the Foreign Ministers of DRC, Rwanda, and Angola at 
the African Union (AU) mid-year coordination meeting in Lusaka from 
July 17-18. Our key message is reinforcing the need to respect the 
DRC's territorial integrity and to terminate any proxy support to armed 
groups on all sides. The United States is supportive of the African-led 
mediation efforts, which have provided important venues for direct 
discussions among regional heads of state. If confirmed, I will work 
closely with Washington to ensure that our engagement in Bujumbura, 
Kampala, Kigali, and elsewhere is coordinated and responds to the 
regional dynamics that have long influenced the crisis.
    MONUSCO has an important role to play in improving the situation. 
The U.N. Mission continues to carry out its mandate for the protection 
of civilians. I am deeply concerned that recent anti-MONUSCO protests 
have turned violent and included attacks on MONUSCO facilities and 
resulted in peacekeeper and protester casualties. At the same time, I 
was appalled by the July 31 shooting of civilians by peacekeepers in 
Kasindi and welcomed the Secretary-General's swift response and strong 
statement calling for accountability. MONUSCO is by no means perfect, 
but it is an essential part of creating conditions for peace in eastern 
DRC. If confirmed, I look forward to frequent interactions with MONUSCO 
leadership and close coordination with USUN as plans for the Mission's 
transition move forward.

    Question. What lessons were learned from the 2018-2020 Ebola 
outbreak and more recent experiences with COVID-19 in DRC that we must 
apply to future outbreaks of infectious disease in DRC? How will you 
approach coordinating multiple U.S. departments and agencies responding 
to such an outbreak as U.S. Ambassador?

    Answer. The Congolese, international health professionals, NGOs, 
and U.S. Government responders all made heroic contributions to defeat 
the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC--the second largest in 
history. Applying lessons learned from this outbreak--whether 
understanding the epidemiological threat, quickly cementing a response 
structure and plan, or early and locally driven community engagement, 
including preventing exploitation within the response--is critical for 
responding to future outbreaks in the DRC and region, whether Ebola or 
COVID-19. Addressing these and other types of outbreaks require 
continued investment in the health system, leveraging our interagency 
health platforms that focus on capacity building at national and 
provincial level governments. With U.S. Government support, the DRC has 
contained six Ebola outbreaks in the past four years alone, declaring 
the most recent outbreak over in July.
    If confirmed, I will work to maintain the U.S. role as the DRC's 
most trusted partner on health. Our contributions to the 2018-2020 
Ebola response were a natural expansion of our longstanding support for 
the Congolese health system. The United States has provided over $1.7 
billion in health assistance to the DRC over the past 20 years. In 
2019, the DRC was designated as a U.S. Global Health Security Agenda 
(GHSA) intensive support partner country, increasing the DRC's longer-
term preparedness capacity to combat health-security threats. Since 
September 2021, the United States has provided over 3.9 million COVID-
19 vaccine doses with the people of the DRC, both in partnership with 
COVAX and through the African Union's African Vaccine Acquisition Trust 
(AVAT).
    U.S. support to the Congolese health sector has been a whole-of-
government approach, bringing together the Departments of State, 
Defense, Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control 
(CDC), and USAID. If confirmed, I will work across all U.S. Government 
departments and agencies to respond to outbreaks and strengthen 
Congolese health systems. As we did with previous outbreaks, if 
confirmed, I would welcome CDC, National Institute of Health (NIH), and 
USAID health and disaster response experts to the DRC for quick 
engagement with our Congolese and international organization partners. 
If confirmed, I would support the wide variety of U.S. Government 
health assistance programs. For example, the CDC has trained more than 
300 Congolese field epidemiologists, ``disease detectives'' who respond 
to COVID-19 and other outbreaks. USAID led a public-private partnership 
with the Merieux Foundation to construct a state-of-the-art biomedical 
lab in eastern DRC that serves as a regional lab to address global 
health issues such as Ebola and COVID-19. I understand more than one-
third of the Congolese population is covered by U.S. Government 
programs in HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, nutrition, malaria, 
and TB interventions reaching at-risk communities. Outbreak response 
requires constant vigilance and constant coordination, and if confirmed 
I will work across U.S. Government partners to communicate and align 
for the most effective response.

    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Kinshasa?

    Answer. U.S. Embassy Kinshasa is doing important work in a 
challenging environment. The Embassy is historically difficult to 
staff, with multiple staffing vacancies. This means many people are 
assuming the work of multiple employees working in outdated, inadequate 
office facilities. New facilities for our personnel are long overdue; 
groundbreaking for construction of a New Embassy Compound to replace 
and consolidate Kinshasa's three separate compounds is expected to 
begin in early 2023. In the meantime, Embassy Kinshasa is pursuing 
upgrades across its three current sites. Infrastructure challenges such 
as telecommunications are very real, for both U.S. and local personnel. 
Travel times to and from the United States also affect our staff's 
well-being. Embassy staff, including locally employed staff, face 
physical and mental health hazards, including losses due to COVID-19.
    Throughout, this team has shown great resilience. I understand 
Embassy Kinshasa prioritizes improving morale through the community 
liaison office's outreach, field trips, town halls, and social events 
for staff to connect with leadership.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Kinshasa?

    Answer. Looking after the safety of the embassy community and 
ensuring that each and every American and local employee can flourish 
and bring his or her best to the job in an environment free of 
harassment and discrimination is my highest priority as a leader. If 
confirmed, I will prioritize recruiting and retaining staff to meet our 
mission's objectives, supporting the physical and mental health of the 
Embassy community, and setting expectations for how to accomplish 
mission priorities while maintaining work/life balance. I commit to 
strong two-way communication with all Mission personnel, including 
locally employed staff on this subject.

    Question. How do you intend to create unified mission and vision at 
Mission Kinshasa?

    Answer. I recognize that, if confirmed, I will be assuming 
leadership of a post in a country of enormous size, complexity, and 
promise. The large portfolio of U.S. assistance requires astute 
direction, prioritization, and coordination. Chronic staffing 
shortages, a situation not unique to Kinshasa, need to be managed to 
ensure that we do not burn out and lose the next generation of Foreign 
Service Africa experts. If confirmed, I will lead regular discussions 
with all agencies present at post to establish and review goals, 
develop strategies and tactics to achieve objectives, and ask that 
section leaders perform similar reviews with their staff.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. My management style starts with listening to individuals, 
understanding their strengths and communicating my expectations 
clearly. I seek to ensure that all staff have the support, resources, 
and training necessary to do their jobs. I also seek to ensure that 
staff understand their responsibilities to do their best every day and 
adhere to the highest standards of ethical behavior in an environment 
of respect. If confirmed, I will bring special attention to ensuring 
that new entrants and first-time section heads have the support and 
mentoring necessary to succeed.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will collaborate closely with and rely on 
my Deputy Chief of Mission for strategic planning, counsel, management 
of personnel, and implementation of U.S. activities and policy 
engagement to accomplish strategic objectives. If confirmed, I will 
work with my Deputy Chief of Mission to articulate and maintain high 
ethical standards and create a culture of diversity, inclusion, and 
respect.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will ask the Deputy Chief of Mission to 
ensure coordination and collaboration across sections and agencies to 
support Integrated Country Strategy (ICS) objectives. I will ask the 
Deputy Chief of Mission to oversee post management with a focus on 
workforce planning and performance. I will also ask the Deputy Chief of 
Mission to lead recruitment efforts for our embassy positions and work 
with other agencies to ensure that their personnel feel fully 
integrated into Embassy Kinshasa's policy formulation and 
implementation. If confirmed, I will collaborate closely with the 
Deputy Chief of Mission on policy implementation and ensure that in my 
absence, the Deputy Chief of Mission has the knowledge, skills, and 
confidence to fully take on the responsibilities of the chief of 
mission.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking. Do 
you believe that it is important to provide employees with accurate, 
constructive feedback on their performances in order to encourage 
improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their roles?

    Answer. Yes, I do.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
the DRC. In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our embassy 
walls enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. Mission Kinshasa will be most effective if it can engage 
with Congolese populations outside of the capital, while respecting the 
safety standards determined by embassy security personnel. Despite 
limited infrastructure in the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa, 
Embassy Kinshasa staff routinely overcome significant logistical 
challenges to travel outside of the capital to engage DRC Government 
officials, civil society, international organizations, nongovernmental 
organizations, media, and members of the international community 
throughout the country. I understand Embassy Kinshasa's Eastern Congo 
Unit, for example, travels monthly to the East to, among other things, 
provide U.S. Government oversight for the $1.16 billion U.N. 
peacekeeping mission (MONUSCO). USAID officers travel countrywide to 
oversee hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. development and 
humanitarian assistance. This travel is critical to ensuring a full 
understanding of the political, economic, and security challenges in 
this zone which has been a flashpoint for conflict. Other section 
personnel need to travel to learn about consular, economic, and 
political issues across the DRC and to provide oversight of U.S. 
assistance. In my previous assignments, I have made sure that a robust 
regional security officer-approved travel plan was fully integrated 
into mission planning. I understand that Embassy Kinshasa's Travel 
Security Working Group routinely evaluates security conditions 
throughout the country to determine suitability for mission travel, and 
RSO puts in place security mitigation measures to overcome security 
challenges. If confirmed, I intend to continue these best practices.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed and as security and health conditions permit, 
I will encourage U.S. diplomats to engage actively, broadly, and in-
person with local populations in and outside Kinshasa. If confirmed, I 
will encourage active engagement through social and virtual media to 
supplement this outreach. If confirmed, I intend to travel regularly 
throughout the DRC and use those visits to facilitate contacts for the 
rest of my team.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in the 
DRC?

    Answer. The Congolese public has embraced social media and public 
diplomacy, and in turn these have been strategic tools for advancing 
U.S. policy objectives and amplifying key messages. For example, 
following President Felix Tshisekedi's April 2019 visit to Washington 
the United States and DRC launched a ``Privileged Partnership for Peace 
and Prosperity,'' with a fifth ``P'' (Preservation of the Environment) 
added in February 2021. Over the years #PP4PP then #PP4PPP has become 
not just a hashtag, but the signature framework for strengthening U.S.-
DRC ties, advancing common values and objectives, and capturing 
comprehensive bilateral engagement and activities. If confirmed, I am 
committed to using public diplomacy as one of the many tools to connect 
with Congolese populations and advance U.S. foreign policy.
    Our colleagues at Embassy Kinshasa regularly use our network of 
American Spaces in Kinshasa, Matadi, Lubumbashi, Goma to support 
programming (virtual and in person) to extend our reach. Embassy 
Kinshasa's LOBA USA podcast, now in its second season, is available 
online and broadcast on 45 community radio stations throughout the 
country. The Embassy leverages its robust network of exchange alumni 
through alumni engagement grants and activities. Our cultural 
programming has partnered with popular music stars to amplify strategic 
priorities such as COVID vaccination and conflict resolution. Finally, 
our innovative use of virtual English instruction in conjunction with 
our spaces has reached a new generation of Congolese youth.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. The DRC's population is overwhelmingly young and many 
either do not have access to quality education or must leave school 
because of economic hardship. Telecommunications infrastructure is 
poor. The limited access to internet or other telecommunications 
infrastructure by many Congolese limits the opportunities for and 
impact of virtual engagements which would be especially valuable in a 
country as large as DRC, where travel for in-person engagements is 
often difficult. Women in particular often do not have access to 
technology. The difficult educational landscape also impacts the 
acquisition of English, which in turn impacts the ability of Embassy 
Kinshasa to leverage opportunities such as exchanges or study abroad 
programs that require English proficiency. If confirmed I will seek to 
find opportunities to overcome these challenges and attract a new 
generation of Congolese to our programs and platforms.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work closely with Main State and the 
interagency to appropriately amplify our messages to advance U.S. 
foreign policy objectives.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel. If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat 
seriously?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Kinshasa personnel?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Human Rights report, the 
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was noted as having numerous 
significant human rights issues such as unlawful killings, 
disappearances, torture, political prisoners, issues of judiciary 
independence, serious abuses in conflict to include civilian harm, 
enforced abductions, use of child soldiers, restrictions of expression, 
corruption, and more. If confirmed, do you commit to directly 
addressing these issues with the host government?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. If confirmed, how could you work with the DRC, 
international organizations, and NGOs, to improve the human rights 
situation in the country?

    Answer. If confirmed, the human rights and democracy agenda would 
be among my highest priorities. We know that allegations of human 
rights violations and abuses and corruption eat away at any prospects 
for the DRC to emerge as a prosperous and stable country. Respect for 
human rights and a strong focus on anti-corruption efforts are in the 
DRC's interest. I understand the Embassy has consistently stressed the 
importance of respecting human rights, including freedom of expression 
(including for members of the press) and the right of peaceful 
assembly. For eastern DRC especially, I understand the Embassy has 
continually and strongly urged armed groups and Congolese security 
forces to end all human rights violations and abuses, end all attacks 
on civilians, and ensure that those responsible for such acts be held 
accountable. The United States and the DRC also held its first 
bilateral Human Rights Dialogue in 2021. If confirmed, I would continue 
partnering closely with the DRC Government to make progress on these 
key issues.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons 
report, the DRC remained on the Tier 2 watch list for not meeting the 
minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The Government 
did not demonstrate increasing efforts compared with previous reporting 
periods; the Congolese National Army (FARDC) officers unlawfully 
recruited and used children, including in combat roles; authorities 
penalized victims of acts traffickers compelled them to commit; no 
anti-trafficking legislation was drafted for a third straight year; and 
only due to a written plan that, if implemented, would constitute a 
significant effort to eliminate trafficking was the DRC granted a 
waiver from being downgraded to Tier 3. If confirmed, how could you 
work with the DRC to implement its written plan?

    Answer. The United States is the Tshisekedi administration's 
partner of choice, and it is aware that our partnership relies on 
respect for human rights, including doing all they can to hold 
traffickers criminally accountable, protect trafficking victims, and 
prevent trafficking in persons. Through USAID's Counter Trafficking in 
Person's $3 million activity, implemented by the Organization for 
International Migration (IOM), the U.S. Government continues to work 
with the Tshisekedi administration's Agency for the Fight Against 
Trafficking in Persons, other government institutions, the judiciary, 
law enforcement, and civil society organizations to implement the DRC's 
National Strategy on Countering Trafficking in Persons. This includes 
strengthening the DRC Government's ability to collect data, investigate 
and prosecute traffickers, protect and provide services to victims of 
trafficking, and sensitize the public and officials to trafficking in 
persons in the DRC. State and USAID have also supported the DRC 
Government's comprehensive draft legislation on trafficking in persons. 
USG agencies continue to advocate at all levels of government for its 
immediate passage.
    Following the DRC's third consecutive Tier 2 Watch List ranking in 
2022, it will be subject to an automatic downgrade to Tier 3 in the 
2023 TIP Report if it does not meet the criteria for an upgrade to Tier 
2 or Tier 1. If confirmed, I will support the DRC Government's 
implementation of its anti-trafficking national action plan and 
continue to urge action on the prioritized recommendations in the 2022 
TIP Report.

    Question. How would you engage with the host government to reduce 
the recruitment and use of children in combat and other military 
related positions?

    Answer. Embassy Kinshasa has continually engaged with the DRC 
Government on the need to improve respect for human rights and 
explained the risks to our bilateral relationship if unlawful 
recruitment and use of children is not addressed. At the same time, the 
U.S. Government implements a variety of programs designed to assist the 
DRC military on this path. Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) and 
International Military Education and Training (IMET) funding for DRC 
enables the United States to continue increasing professionalization of 
the military, allowing it to provide security within its territory 
while respecting human rights and international humanitarian law (IHL). 
In addition, PKO and IMET funding has supported areas such as military 
justice, civil-military relations, human rights training, IHL training, 
English language training, military engineering, and resource 
management and logistics for security forces in DRC. These efforts not 
only enhance security provision, but also helps make the security 
forces a more transparent, accountable institution. Building on this 
successful cooperation, the United States signed a memorandum of 
understanding (MOU) with the DRC Government in August 2020 to launch 
new cooperation in civil military operations (CMO), strategic 
communications, engineering, and English language training. We are also 
working with the Congolese armed forces (FARDC) to revamp its human 
resources infrastructure which, among other things, would allow for 
enhanced accountability.
    These efforts have produced results. The number of prosecutions of 
both state and armed group actors for crimes involving human rights 
violations and abuses, including unlawful recruitment and use of 
children, remains high, as are the number of children separated from 
armed groups. This past July, the U.N. Secretary-General, in his annual 
report on children and armed conflict, welcomed ``the commitment of the 
[DRC Government] to sustain the gains made in preventing child 
recruitment and use, including through screening mechanisms.'' He also 
commended the DRC ``for its efforts to hold perpetrators of grave 
violations accountable and urge them to continue to do so, including 
for cases of child recruitment and use, and for cases of sexual 
violence.'' If confirmed, I will leverage these tools and our close 
relationship with the DRC to aid its commitment to reduce the unlawful 
recruitment and use of children.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, the DRC remains a country of operation for ISIS, 
attacking civilians in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces. U.S. 
officials have met with government authorities, urging security forces 
and political leaders to refrain from violence and respect the civil 
rights of society. What actions would you take with the host government 
to build on previous U.S. engagement and promote religious freedom and 
tolerance?

    Answer. The United States and DRC are dedicated to the defeat of 
ISIS. In March 2021, the U.S. designated ISIS-DRC (also known as Allied 
Democratic Forces) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and 
Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). The Allied Democratic 
Forces is designated under the U.N. 1533 DRC Sanctions Regime. In 
November 2021, Secretary Blinken also designated ISIS an Entity of 
Particular Concern for the fifth consecutive year, as a non-state actor 
that has engaged in particularly severe violations of religious 
freedom. The DRC joined the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in 2019 and 
is increasingly engaged with the Coalition, having participated in the 
2022 D-ISIS Ministerial as well as the most recent Communication 
Working Group meeting held in Washington in July.
    With their influence on a wide range of civil and political issues, 
including elections, religious leaders throughout the DRC are close 
partners of our embassy in Kinshasa. Embassy Kinshasa has continually 
engaged with counterparts in Ministries of Human Rights, Justice, 
Defense, and Interior to discuss issues of freedom of religion or 
belief, including government relations with religious organizations. 
U.S. engagement prioritizes ensuring that the DRC Government respects 
human rights, including the rights to freedom of expression, freedom of 
peaceful assembly, and to freedom of religion or belief. Ambassador 
Hammer met with religious leaders frequently and, if confirmed, I would 
continue these efforts to engage with government representatives and 
civil society groups to help ensure freedom of religion or belief for 
the people of the DRC.

    Question. How could you work with security forces to increase 
pressure towards removal of ISIS operation within the country?

    Answer. Starting last November, the Ugandan defense forces (UPDF) 
have been conducting a military intervention in eastern DRC targeting 
ISIS-DRC, named Operation Shuja. The Ugandans are conducting this 
mission with the DRC Government approval. MONUSCO is not mandated to 
work alongside the UPDF, but we have constantly urged and tried to 
ensure operations are deconflicted with MONUSCO and the Congolese armed 
forces (FARDC) and that all forces operating in DRC respect human 
rights.
    The DRC joined the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in 2019 and is 
increasingly engaged with the Coalition; having participated in the 
2022 D-ISIS Ministerial as well as the most recent Communication 
Working Group meeting held in Washington in July. Closer coordination 
with DRC security forces will require reform within the FARDC. U.S. 
training for the FARDC and increased military to military cooperation 
are items very high on the agenda of the Government of the DRC but 
deepening our ties will require commensurate commitment to reform by 
the Government. To strengthen DRC's ability to prevent and respond to 
violent conflict, I will, if confirmed, continue to engage with the DRC 
Government on the need for security sector reform, including respect 
for the rule of law and human rights and the implementation of a 
community-based national disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration 
program.

    Question. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the U.N., including in elections 
for specialized bodies like the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who if 
elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. 
She is in a tough race that will require early, consistent engagement 
across capitals and within the U.N. member states. If confirmed, do you 
commit to demarching the DRC and any other counterparts necessary to 
encourage their support of Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. If confirmed, how can you work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify, recruit, 
and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior Program 
Officer (JPO) program at the U.N.?

    Answer. The Junior Professional Officer program is one of the key 
opportunities offered by the U.N. to encourage young professionals 
interested in serving in international organizations, and it provides 
them with hands-on experience across various U.N. agencies. The 
International Organization Affairs Bureau (IO) and the U.S. Mission to 
the U.N. (USUN) are well placed to ensure we have sufficient resources, 
tools, and staffing to support more positions for American citizen JPOs 
in the U.N. system. With these resources, we can work strategically to 
increase the number of JPO opportunities funded by the U.S. Government 
into key agencies and bodies that work on U.S. priorities, expand our 
recruitment and outreach activities to ensure these opportunities are 
widely known and available to interested U.S. citizens, and provide 
tools and services to strengthen our competitiveness in placing 
qualified American citizens into the U.N. system. If confirmed, I will 
aid the efforts of IO and USUN from Kinshasa where possible.

    Question. The DRC has a low rate of voting coincidence with the 
United States in the U.N. General Assembly and in the Security Council. 
What is your assessment of this issue?

    Answer. The U.S.-DRC relationship has strengthened significantly 
since the 2019 inauguration of President Felix Tshisekedi. However, a 
new DRC Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Georges 
Nzongola-Ntalaja, was only just appointed in January 2022, and I note 
that in 2022 the DRC supported resolutions in U.N. bodies that called 
out Russia for its attack on Ukraine and aligned with U.S. priorities 
at the United Nations. If confirmed, I will work through the U.S. 
Mission to the United Nations and others in the Department of State to 
ensure U.S. foreign policy objectives are shared and understood across 
Kinshasa, Washington, and New York.

    Question. If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to 
engage with the Congolese on anticipated votes in the U.N. system that 
would increase their voting coincidence with the United States?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work through the U.S. Mission to the 
United Nations and others in the Department of State to ensure U.S. 
foreign policy objectives are shared and understood across Kinshasa, 
Washington, and New York. I will meet with DRC Government officials at 
the highest levels when appropriate to encourage aligned voting 
coincidence.



                               __________


            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
          Submitted to Hon. Lucy Tamlyn by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. With their absolute control of 
Chinese society and industry, the CCP could stop all of these 
destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the Chinese Communist Party a threat to the United States?

    Answer. Certain activities by the People's Republic of China (PRC) 
and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) represent a challenge to U.S. 
interests globally and in the Africa region. As Secretary Blinken said 
on May 26, we will invest, align, and compete with the PRC to defend 
our interests and build our vision for the future.

    Question. Does the Chinese Communist Party undertake any activities 
that are beneficial to U.S. interests?

    Answer. We are prepared to work together with the People's Republic 
of China (PRC) where our interests intersect, in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo and elsewhere, and where it is essential for 
global peace and prosperity. Issues like climate change, the global 
drug trade, and COVID-19 directly threaten our prosperity and security, 
and we need to work with the PRC--just as much as the PRC needs to work 
with us--to solve these problems without borders.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China in 
the Democratic Republic of Congo?

    Answer. We are prepared to work together with the People's Republic 
of China (PRC) where our interests intersect, in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo and elsewhere, and where it is essential for 
global peace and prosperity. Issues such as climate change, the global 
drug trade, and COVID-19 directly threaten our prosperity and security, 
and we need to work with the PRC--just as much as the PRC needs to work 
with us--to solve these problems without borders.  If confirmed, I will 
invest in our partnership with the DRC, align our concerns highlighting 
the risks associated with PRC engagement that could impact the DRC's 
security and sovereignty and U.S. interests, and ensure that our vision 
of a positive partnership and regional security and prosperity competes 
successfully with the PRC.

    Question. China has a large peacekeeping presence in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (DRC), where China Molybdenum, a Chinese mining 
company, has an 80 percent stake in one of the world's largest cobalt 
mines and the largest copper mining operation in the DRC. The DRC has 
given Chinese companies valuable concessions to develop the rich 
critical mineral resources, like cobalt, in the country. Cobalt is 
critical to the U.S. information technology and defense industries. 
Beijing's involvement in the peacekeeping mission in the DRC, and its 
heavy involvement in the DRC's cobalt sector, raises concerns that it 
is using its involvement in the peacekeeping system to protect its 
economic interests. The Trump Administration pushed the DRC Government 
to revisit these Chinese concessions.

   If confirmed, what will you do to convince the DRC to renegotiate, 
        or even revoke, mineral concessions given to Chinese companies?

    Answer. The United States supports the Government of the DRC's 
decision to review mining contracts and pursue greater accountability 
in the sector. In May 2021, President Tshisekedi announced his 
intention to review Chinese mining deals with unfavorable terms for the 
DRC. This is an ongoing process, and the United States has informed the 
DRC Government of our support for its decision to review contracts. 
Further, economic development should promote democratic governance, 
respect for human rights, and transparency. The United States is 
providing more than $30 million in assistance to help the DRC promote 
responsible and sustainable mining practices and is actively looking at 
new engagements in the sector. As one example, USAID's new Constructing 
Competitive Responsible Minerals Trade project in the DRC provides 
trade and investment facilitation support with businesses that support 
responsible, transparent, and conflict-free mining from the DRC. We 
support responsible minerals sourcing and trading and work closely with 
the private sector to support conflict-free mineral supply chains. We 
created the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals, working 
with USAID and the Department of Labor, U.S. companies, and civil 
society organizations to improve governance systems needed for ethical 
supply chains of conflict minerals in the DRC and Great Lakes region.
    We echo the long-standing calls from African capitals that PRC 
actions must respect host country laws, particularly regarding the 
human and labor rights, the rule of law, and protections for the 
environment. We want to ensure U.S. companies can compete on an even 
playing field, promoting entrepreneurship, infrastructure development, 
energy access, capacity-building, and fair practices. I am confident 
that, in a level playing field, U.S. companies will be a partner of 
choice for the DRC. If confirmed, I hope to see the DRC on a positive 
trajectory that enables it to realize its vast potential for the 
benefit of the Congolese and American people, as well as Central Africa 
and the world.

    Question. I understand that you served as Ambassador to the Central 
African Republic (CAR) from January 2019 to January 2022. During this 
period, the Government of the CAR essentially became a branch of 
Russia's mercenary, The Wagner Group. To this day, the CAR Government 
is staffed with the associates and friends of those Russian officials 
currently planning and managing Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine. 
Valery Zakharov, an FSB agent, serves as a national security advisor, 
Russian Air Force General Oleg Polguev is an advisor to the Defense 
Minister, and another FSB agent, Vladimir Tintorenko, is an advisor to 
the Prime Minister.

   During your tenure as Ambassador to CAR, were you aware of growing 
        Russian entanglement with the CAR Government?

    Answer. Yes, I was aware and I raised our concerns about the Wagner 
Group and Russian presence with the highest levels of the Government. 
The United States Government has severely limited its security 
assistance to the Government of CAR in response to the CAR Government's 
decision to continue collaborating with these actors while we evaluate 
next steps.

    Question. Did you advocate for U.S. policies that would encourage 
the CAR Government to remove Wagner Group and Russian presence in CAR? 
Please elaborate.

    Answer. We raised our concerns about the Wagner Group and Russian 
presence with the highest levels of the Government, and severely 
limited our security assistance to the Government of CAR in response to 
their decision to continue collaborating with these actors while we 
evaluate next steps. We informed the CAR Government that future 
assistance would be limited should they continue that relationship. We 
have encouraged the CAR Government to end impunity for violence and 
seek partners that respect human rights.

    Question. With regard to the DRC, is the Chinese Communist Party 
making efforts to increase its own influence within that government?

    Answer. The People's Republic of China (PRC) has extensive 
interests in the DRC. The DRC is now tied with the PRC as the third-
biggest producer of copper in the world, and the DRC produces 
approximately 70 percent of the world's cobalt. Exports of copper and 
cobalt provide 75 percent of the DRC's export revenue, and the PRC is 
both the largest consumer of DRC-produced copper and cobalt and the 
DRC's largest trading partner. If confirmed, I will continue to engage 
with the DRC Government to cement the United States as the DRC's 
partner of choice.

    Question. If confirmed as Ambassador to the DRC, what will you do 
to ensure that the Chinese Communist Party does not establish the same 
level of influence there as the Russian Wagner Group did in CAR under 
your watch?

    Answer. The People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Chinese 
Communist Party's (CCP) interest in the DRC is primarily economic. The 
PRC is the largest consumer of DRC-produced cobalt and copper and the 
DRC's largest trading partner. The United States has a long history of 
support for the DRC, including over $20 billion in assistance, much of 
which has gone to address health and humanitarian emergencies. Socially 
responsible U.S. business practices compare favorably against PRC 
business models. Congressionally mandated annual reporting, such as the 
Human Rights Report, the Findings of the Worst Forms of Child Labor, 
and the Trafficking in Persons Report shine a spotlight on exploitative 
business practices and Executive Orders ensure that products made with 
forced labor and child labor do not reach U.S. markets. We are working 
with international partners and multilateral organizations, such as the 
International Labor Organization, to advance due diligence standards 
and practices in global supply chains and support internationally 
recognized worker rights. This message resonates with Congolese 
citizens, and the Congolese media have highlighted labor abuses in PRC-
run companies.
    We respect the ability of countries to decide for themselves 
whether to partner with the PRC. At the same time, we want the DRC to 
have options, to benefit from long-term sustainable economic growth, 
and to ensure it has the information it needs to make informed 
decisions. If confirmed, I will continue to amplify Embassy Kinshasa's 
work advancing a vision for economic development that promotes 
democratic governance, respect for human rights, and transparency. If 
confirmed, I will invest in our partnership with the DRC, align our 
concerns highlighting the risks associated with PRC engagement that 
could impact the DRC's security and sovereignty and U.S. interests, and 
ensure that our vision of a positive partnership and regional security 
and prosperity competes successfully with the PRC.

    Question. How do you view China's diplomatic and economic 
engagement in the DRC?

    Answer. The DRC's economic resources make it an attractive 
destination for any foreign investor, including the People's Republic 
of China (PRC). We do not seek to limit the DRC's partnerships with 
other countries. We want the DRC to have options and to ensure it has 
the information it needs to make informed decisions.
    In this regard we echo the long-standing calls from African 
governments that PRC economic engagement should respect host country 
laws, particularly those relating to labor rights and environmental 
protections. We want the Congolese people to know that corrupt mineral 
exploitation deals, illegal logging, and environmental devastation is 
not inevitable. We also want to ensure that U.S. companies can compete 
on an even playing field. We believe the DRC benefits more from its 
partnership with the United States. The U.S. Government's commitment to 
responsible business conduct shapes global standards that ensure that 
rights are respected around the world. DRC officials tell us that they 
prefer investments by American enterprises because they know a U.S. 
corporation will respect host country laws and labor rights and protect 
its workers.

    Question. What is the host government's main interest in engaging 
with China?

    Answer. The DRC is now tied with the PRC as the third-biggest 
producer of copper in the world, and the DRC produces approximately 70 
percent of the world's cobalt. Exports of copper and cobalt provide 75 
percent of the DRC's export revenue, and the PRC is both the largest 
consumer of DRC-produced copper and cobalt and the DRC's largest 
trading partner.

    Question. Do you view our work in Kinshasa as sufficient to counter 
malign PRC economic activity?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will fully support the U.S. Government 
inter-agency endorsed Integrated Country Strategy's (ICS) vision for 
economic development that promotes democratic governance, respect for 
human rights, and transparency. Under the ICS, USAID initiatives are 
supporting investment and trade opportunities in DRC's minerals, 
energy, and agricultural sectors with a particular focus on responsible 
natural resources exploitation. Congressionally mandated reporting, 
such as the Human Rights Report, the Findings on the Worst Forms of 
Child Labor and the Trafficking in Persons Report help shine a 
spotlight on exploitative business practices, and Executive Orders 
ensure that products made with forced labor and child labor do not 
reach U.S. markets. We are working with international partners and 
multilateral organizations, such as the International Labor 
Organization, to advance due diligence standards and practices in 
global supply chains. These messages resonate with Congolese citizens, 
and the Congolese media have themselves highlighted labor abuses in 
PRC-run companies.

    Question. What is your perspective on the situation in Eastern 
Congo and the role of the United States in addressing the persistent 
insecurity challenges and complex regional dynamics, both bilaterally 
and through multilateral organizations, namely the U.N. Peacekeeping 
Mission MONUSCO?

    Answer. For decades, the people of eastern DRC have suffered 
violence and insecurity, primarily perpetrated in recent years by armed 
groups and sometimes by DRC's own security forces. Corrupt networks 
have profited from the illicit exploitation of the region's natural 
resources. Currently, the M23 armed group allegedly supported by Rwanda 
is controlling territory near the Uganda border and killing civilians. 
Addressing the current crisis, and the long-standing underlying issues 
including the role of DRC's neighbors, is a priority for the State 
Department. We have maintained steady engagement with senior host 
nation officials as well as key partners to encourage de-escalation of 
regional tensions, the termination of the M23 offensive, and progress 
on the demobilization of all armed groups. Secretary Blinken will visit 
Kinshasa August 9-10 and Kigali August 10-11, following Ambassador 
Thomas-Greenfield's travel August 4-5 to Uganda. The Bureau of African 
Affairs' Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Massinga discussed this 
issue in depth with the Foreign Ministers of DRC, Rwanda, and Angola at 
the African Union (AU) mid-year coordination meeting in Lusaka from 
July 17-18. Our key message is reinforcing the need to respect the 
DRC's territorial integrity and to terminate any proxy support to armed 
groups on all sides. The United States is supportive of the African-led 
mediation efforts, which have provided important venues for direct 
discussions among regional heads of state. If confirmed, I will work 
closely with Washington to ensure that our engagement in Bujumbura, 
Kampala, Kigali, and elsewhere is coordinated and responds to the 
regional dynamics that have long influenced the crisis.
    MONUSCO has an important role to play in improving the situation. 
The U.N. Mission continues to carry out its mandate for the protection 
of civilians. I am deeply concerned that recent anti-MONUSCO protests 
have turned violent and included attacks on MONUSCO facilities and 
resulted in peacekeeper and protester casualties. At the same time, I 
was appalled by the July 31 shooting of civilians by peacekeepers in 
Kasindi and welcomed the Secretary-General's swift response and strong 
statement calling for accountability. MONUSCO is by no means perfect, 
but it is an essential part of creating conditions for peace in eastern 
DRC. If confirmed, I look forward to frequent interactions with MONUSCO 
leadership and close coordination with USUN as plans for the Mission's 
transition move forward.

         to Rachna Sachdeva Korhonen by Senator Robert Menendez

    Question. If confirmed, how will you implement this 5-year strategy 
given there will be a military junta in place for nearly two of the 
five years?

    Answer. The interagency Sahel strategy seeks to build the political 
resolve of Sahel governments to regain public confidence at the 
national and local levels by providing the equitable delivery of 
government services, law enforcement, and justice. The Mali Integrated 
Country Strategy and USAID Country Development Cooperative Strategy are 
the baselines strategies for Mali and were informed by the Sahel 
Strategy. We can make progress on these goals during the transition 
period, as the transition government seeks also to make reforms that 
will strengthen the foundation of Mali's democracy. We provided 
technical support to the electoral law passed in June that creates a 
single electoral management body, a best practice that election experts 
have called for repeatedly. We stand ready to assist the transition 
government as it moves towards a constitutional referendum and 
elections.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to updating me on the 
implementation of the strategy within 180 days of arriving at post?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit, in coordination with the State 
Department's Bureau of Legislative Affairs, to promptly accommodate 
requests for briefings and for information by you and this Committee, 
including on the implementation of the strategy. Our foreign policy is 
stronger when the two branches of government communicate, and I would 
look forward to strengthening that communication

    Question. Do you believe personal travel bans or other sanctions on 
military officers who seize power unconstitutionally, or who engage in 
gross violations of human rights are a useful tool?

    Answer. As I understand it, our policy objective has been to work 
with the transition government to get Mali back on the path to 
democracy. We continually review all tools available to us and 
determine what is the best tool to use to advance foreign policy goals. 
Imposing visa restrictions or financial sanctions as a blanket response 
to adverse political activity may be incongruent with the task of 
working with the transition government to undertake reforms that are 
demanded by their people to form the foundation of a more responsive 
democratic system. My understanding is that following the May 2021 
military takeover, we cut security assistance programs valued at $9.1 
million that had continued under available authorities. Ending security 
assistance, which the Mali coup leaders monitor closely as military 
officers, had a more significant impact. When we have credible 
information that a foreign official has been involved in a gross 
violation of human rights, we are required by law to designate that 
individual under Section 7031(c). If confirmed, I commit to continually 
assessing whether visa restrictions or financial sanctions should be 
imposed.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to reviewing the approach we 
have taking, and sending to me in writing, your assessment of how such 
sanctions could usefully be applied within 90 days of arriving at post?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to reviewing the approach we have 
taken and sending to you in writing, my assessment of how such visa 
restrictions or financial sanctions could usefully be applied within 90 
days of arriving at Post. I also commit to continuously assessing 
whether visa restrictions or financial sanctions should be imposed 
during my Ambassadorship, if confirmed.

    Question. What are the most important actions you have taken in 
your career to date to support democracy and human rights? What has 
been the impact of your actions?

    Answer. During my time in Sri Lanka, we encouraged the newly 
elected government to include all factions in the Government but to 
also provide accountability for wartime abuses. We achieved some 
successes on both counts, but it was slow and cumbersome requiring a 
lot of effort from multiple parts of the US Government. Our biggest 
success was to encourage the Sri Lankan Parliament to work together 
with Congress on training and exchanges, a partnership that exists 
until today that is codified in a USAID project lasting multiple years. 
During my time in Kirkuk, Iraq, I was able to convince the Turkmen 
faction to stand in local elections after they threatened to boycott. 
Their participation in the elections resulted in elections that were 
accepted by all parties and that laid the foundation for governance and 
democracy in Kirkuk.

    Question. What issues are the most pressing challenges to democracy 
or democratic development in the Republic of Mali? These challenges 
might include obstacles to participatory and accountable governance and 
institutions, rule of law, authentic political competition, civil 
society, human rights and press freedom. Please be as specific as 
possible.

    Answer. There are many challenges to democracy and democratic 
development in Mali. Mali has suffered three military seizures of power 
in the past ten years. Weak governance, a severe security crisis, poor 
development, and acute food insecurity are some of the many 
difficulties of life in Mali. The failure of government to address 
these problems has led to a loss of faith by many Malians in their 
government and in democracy. This frustration is particularly apparent 
in the north, where the minority populations have long felt ignored by 
Bamako. Additionally, corruption is rampant, though during the 
transition we have not seen the same high-level corruption as in 
previous regimes. Political parties are numerous but often do not think 
beyond the special interests of Bamako. The arrival of the Kremlin-
backed Wagner Group was accompanied by a spike in pro-Wagner and pro-
Russian sentiments across social media as well as disinformation linked 
to Wagner financier Yevgeniy Prigozhin that has muddied the media 
environment. Warnings by the transition government to support the 
Malian Armed Forces reportedly led to self-censorship by the press. 
Some critics of the transition government have been arrested. Women 
continue to play a secondary role in Malian society and the transition 
government has fallen short of meeting the law that requires thirty 
percent of elected or appointed officials to be women. Finally, the 
transition government's plan to tackle security does not extend to 
addressing root drivers of conflict, and as evidenced by allegations of 
human rights abuses and violations, will increase the distrust Mali's 
people feel toward their government.

    Question. What steps will you take--if confirmed--to support 
democracy in the Republic of Mali? What do you hope to accomplish 
through these actions? What are the potential impediments to addressing 
the specific obstacles you have identified?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will assist the transition government as it 
moves towards a constitutional referendum and elections, building on 
the partnership established when the United States provided technical 
assistance in support of the creation of the recent electoral law. I 
will support programs aimed at bolstering the capacity of civil society 
and the media as well as programs to counter disinformation. I will 
amplify the voices of women who are working to make a difference in 
their communities and for their country. Through these actions, I hope 
to work with Malians to set them on a path to responsive democratic 
governance that will lead to a more stable Mali.
    Mali's return to democracy and the reforms necessary to create a 
strong foundation for that democracy are ultimately in the hands of the 
transition government. We cannot want it more than they do. If 
confirmed, I will be an advocate for the Malian people and press for 
the democracy they deserve.

    Question. How will you utilize U.S. Government assistance resources 
at your disposal, including the Democracy Commission Small Grants 
program and other sources of State Department and USAID funding, to 
support democracy and governance, and what will you prioritize in 
processes to administer such assistance?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will utilize all available U.S. foreign 
assistance programs and tools to strengthen democracy and good 
governance in Mali. State Department and USAID resources are critical 
to achieving our policy goals and advancing our values in Mali. I will 
prioritize available assistance necessary to restore democratic 
governance in Mali.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to meet with civil society 
members, human rights and other non-governmental organizations in the 
U.S. and with local human rights NGOs, and other members of civil 
society in the Republic of Mali? What steps will you take to pro-
actively address efforts to restrict or penalize NGOs and civil society 
via legal or regulatory measures?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to meeting with civil society 
members, human rights and other non-government organizations in the 
United States and with local human rights NGOs, and other members of 
civil society in Mali. I understand the Embassy conducts such 
engagements regularly and I plan to build on their good work. I will 
advocate for unimpeded operation by NGOs and civil society, who do much 
to address root drivers of instability, both with the transition 
government and publicly should it be deemed helpful.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to meet with democratically 
oriented political opposition figures and parties? What steps will you 
take to encourage genuine political competition? Will you advocate for 
access and inclusivity for women, minorities and youth within political 
parties?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to meet with democratically oriented 
political opposition figures and parties. I will encourage political 
figures and parties to consider the equities of all Malians, not just 
those in Bamako, and to run on platforms built on substance, not 
personality. I will advocate with the transition government for 
opposition figures to be able to participate fully in the political 
process as Mali holds legislative elections, a constitutional 
referendum, and presidential elections by March 2024. I will advocate 
with the transition government for opposition figures to be able to 
speak freely without fear of reprisal. I will advocate for press 
freedom, so that disinformation does not interfere in political debates 
and dialogues. I will advocate for access and inclusivity for women, 
members of minority groups, and youth within political parties. I will 
urge the transition government to meet any related requirements under 
national law, such as the 30 percent appointment of women in the 
Cabinet and the National Transition Council. I will press for the 
expeditious implementation of the Algiers Accord, so Mali's democracy 
more fully represents its northern citizens.

    Question. Will you and your embassy team actively engage with the 
Republic of Mali on freedom of the press and address any government 
efforts designed to control or undermine press freedom through legal, 
regulatory or other measures? Will you commit to meeting regularly with 
independent, local press in the Republic of Mali?

    Answer. I am very concerned about the decrease in press freedom and 
the rise of disinformation that has accompanied the arrival of the 
Kremlin-backed Wagner Group. If confirmed, I plan to prioritize 
addressing and countering disinformation. A well-informed citizenry is 
required for a functioning democracy, so I support the continuation of 
current embassy and Department programs to educate and train 
journalists about the dangers of disinformation and procedures to 
publicly refute dangerous disinformation, such as fact-checking. I will 
commit to meeting regularly with local press in Mali and extolling the 
dangers of disinformation and promoting the benefits of a free press.

    Question. Will you and your embassy team actively engage with civil 
society and government counterparts on countering disinformation and 
propaganda disseminated by foreign state or non-state actors in the 
country?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will prioritize building on the embassy 
team's ongoing work and programs to counter disinformation and 
propaganda perpetuated by foreign and non-state actors. I will also 
build on the close relationship created between the embassy team and 
the Department's Global Engagement Center (GEC) as they prioritize 
exposing and countering state-sponsored disinformation. The GEC 
recently released a public-facing bulletin to expose the Kremlin-backed 
Wagner Group, Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin, and Russia's 
disinformation networks in Africa, and the bulletin spotlighted several 
recent cases of disinformation in Mali. I will engage the transition 
government on the destabilizing effects of disinformation and the need 
to protect press freedom.

    Question. Will you and your embassy teams actively engage with the 
Republic of Mali on the right of labor groups to organize, including 
for independent trade unions?

    Answer. Labor unions are an important and influential part of 
Mali's society, and the International Trade Union Confederation has 
noted the significant efforts of labor unions to strengthen social 
dialogue and progress on climate change, social protection, universal 
health insurance, decent work, migration and education. Mali continues 
to face significant challenges on labor as almost 90 percent of workers 
are in the informal economy, about 12 percent of children are engaging 
in child labor, and women still do the lion's share of unpaid care and 
domestic work, including some forms of descent-based slavery. I will 
engage the transition government on the right of workers to organize, 
including to form independent trade unions, and encourage legal 
remedies for labor abuses.

    Question. Will you commit to using your position, if confirmed, to 
defend the human rights and dignity of all people in the Republic of 
Mali, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will use my position to promote respect for 
the human rights and dignity of all in Mali, no matter their sexual 
orientation or gender identity. A hallmark of Mali's society is its 
diversity. A country that unites across its differences will always be 
stronger and more resilient.

    Question. What challenges do the lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people face in the Republic of Mali?

    Answer. LGBTQI+ individuals in Mali experience physical, 
psychological, and gender-based violence, with some individuals 
subjected to ``corrective'' punishment. Police frequently refuse to 
intervene when such violence has occurred. As the transition government 
considers members of the LGBTQI+ community to be ``immoral,'' promoting 
respect for freedom of association remains difficult. The law prohibits 
conduct pertaining to ``attacks on morality,'' thereby criminalizing, 
on a de facto basis, consensual same-sex sexual conduct between adults, 
as well as non-sexual association. The transition government actively 
enforces this law. Most LGBTQI+ individuals in Mali isolate themselves 
and keep their sexual orientation or gender identity hidden. LGBTQI+ 
individuals frequently drop out of school, leave their places of 
employment, and do not seek medical treatment in order to hide their 
sexual identity and avoid social stigmatization.

    Question. What specifically will you commit to do to help LGBTQ 
people in the Republic of Mali?

    Answer. As Secretary Blinken has said, promoting and advancing 
respect for the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons is a foreign policy 
priority for this Administration. If confirmed, I will advocate for the 
human rights and dignity of all in Mali, including LGBTQI+ persons. In 
the spirit of ``do no harm,'' I will meet with LGBTQI+ civil society 
members and seek their advice on how the U.S. Embassy can best support 
them.

    Question. Will you commit, if confirmed, to ensuring that you fully 
brief Members of Congress and/or their staff each time you are in 
Washington for visits or consultations during your tenure as Ambassador 
to the Republic of Mali?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit, in coordination with the State 
Department's Bureau of Legislative Affairs, to promptly accommodate 
requests for briefings and for information by this Committee. Our 
foreign policy is stronger when the two branches of government 
communicate, and I would look forward to strengthening that 
communication.

    Question. Last week we held a hearing on the important work of the 
State Department's Chief Diversity Officer and the important role 
diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility efforts play in 
maintaining our countries' competitive edge on the global stage. How do 
you anticipate fostering diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
accessibility at Embassy Bamako?

    Answer. Secretary Blinken recently said ``The rich diversity of the 
United States is a core source of our national strength and a cherished 
part of our national identity. As the agency that represents the United 
States to the world, the U.S. Department of State has an opportunity--
and a responsibility--to build a diplomatic workforce that reflects 
America's diversity. Diversity makes us stronger and more creative. It 
is how we bring to bear people's many ideas, experiences, expertise, 
and contributions for the benefit of our organization and our country. 
We simply cannot advance America's interests and values around the 
world without a workforce that is truly representative of the American 
people.''
    I will stand up for fairness, equity, inclusion and accessibility 
at work. I will integrate these principles into my leadership at 
Embassy Bamako. Throughout my State Department career, I have valued 
and encouraged a diverse and inclusive work environment, and if 
confirmed, I intend to bring that same spirit to Embassy Bamako by 
supporting post's inclusive hiring and selection procedures.

    Question. What specifically will you do to prioritize and promote 
diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, while also combating 
racism, discrimination, and inequality among locally employed staff in 
the Republic of Mali?

    Answer. I will hold all of our staff at Embassy Bamako to the same 
standard. Mali is a country rich and diverse in culture and Embassy 
Bamako reflects that diversity. If confirmed, I intend to ensure that 
all employees working in Embassy Bamako, whether they are locally 
employed staff, eligible family members, or U.S. direct hires, feel 
supported and heard in their work. I maintain an open office policy and 
welcome the contributions and ideas of those working in our mission.

    Question. In addition to focusing on diversity, equity, inclusion, 
and accessibility in our workforce, will you commit to engaging more 
equitably in operations and programming, particularly with potential 
partners and communities that traditionally have been marginalized, 
excluded, or underrepresented in ours and others' donor partnership 
efforts? How do you anticipate utilizing local expertise, knowledge, 
and capacity to meet our foreign policy goals?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to engaging with partners and 
communities that have been traditionally marginalized, underrepresented 
or excluded in donor or partnership efforts. Learning from local 
expertise and knowledge is critical to building successful programs and 
foreign policy goals.
    Embassy Bamako has a truly diverse workforce from all parts of 
Mali, and I hope we can leverage that for our strategic goals for 
democracy, governance and services for all.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
         to Rachna Sachdeva Korhonen by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. If confirmed, how will you engage the current Government 
in Mali on the issue of return to constitutional democratic rule?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue to stand firmly with the 
Malian people in their aspirations for democracy, peace, development, 
and respect for human rights. I will press the transition government to 
keep its promise to return the country to the Malian people through 
democratic governance. The reforms the transition government has 
committed to undertake, such as constitutional reform, will build a 
foundation for a stronger, more responsive democracy in Mali and if 
confirmed, I will encourage the transition government to undertake 
these reforms expeditiously. I will also caution them that some reforms 
are the work of generations and will need to be handed over to a 
democratically-elected government. I echo Ambassador Linda Thomas-
Greenfield's observation ``that a Mali isolated from its community of 
nations and ECOWAS is not where Mali wants to be.'' I share her wish to 
work with the Malian transition government to bring Mali back into the 
community of nations where it belongs. In order to rebuild 
relationships with its neighbors, the transition government first needs 
to demonstrate commitment to the transition timelines and to work 
transparently with ECOWAS special envoy Goodluck Jonathan and the 
transition monitoring committee. If confirmed, I will seek to assist 
the transition government as it moves towards the constitutional 
referendum and elections, but we must see progress.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you engage the current Government 
in Mali on the issue of implementing what is salvageable of the Algiers 
Accord?

    Answer. Full implementation of the Algiers Accord remains the best 
path to peace in northern Mali. The Accord itself addresses key 
grievances of northern populations and calls for important steps 
towards decentralization of power, security sector reform, development, 
and reconciliation. These priorities are now applicable to other areas 
of the country suffering from instability. If fully implemented, the 
Accord's provisions will provide greater stability and facilitate 
efforts to address the growing terrorist threats in the country.
    Since we assess that the main driver of instability in Mali and the 
broader Sahel is a lack of state presence and responsive governance, 
the tenets of the Algiers Accord are exactly the kind of improved 
governance measures we believe will address root causes of instability. 
If confirmed, I will underscore this fact to the transition government 
and urge full implementation of the Accord. The recent meeting among 
the signatory parties and the transition government's pledge to 
incorporate 26,000 ex-fighters into the Malian Armed Forces are 
positive steps. I will also stress that no level of international 
involvement can secure peace for Mali. The signatory parties themselves 
must be driving the effort to bring peace throughout Mali.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you engage the current Government 
in Mali on the presence of the Russian-affiliated Wagner Group in Mali 
as a security alternative following the departure of French Operation 
Barkhane?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue to highlight the harmful 
effects of the Wagner Group, including the rise in allegations of human 
rights violations and abuses emanating from the campaigns of the Malian 
Armed Forces alongside the Wagner Group. I will stress that these 
allegations will put the resumption of U.S. security assistance in 
doubt after a democratically-elected government has taken office in 
Mali. I will address the limitations placed on the U.N. 
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) due 
to the Wagner Group and note how the Malian people are not receiving 
the full benefit of MINUSMA's efforts due to those restrictions. I will 
illuminate how Yevgeniy Prigozhin's disinformation network is harming 
Mali's media space, threatening peacekeeper safety, and manipulating 
the Malian people. I will underscore that Prigozhin's extractive 
partnerships will leave Mali poorer as it gives away resources that 
could be invested into the Malian Armed Forces and other government 
efforts aimed to tackle root drivers of instability.

    Question. What is your view of the U.N. Peacekeeping Mission in 
Mali, MINUSMA, the deadliest peacekeeping mission in the world, 
particularly given the post-coup environment in Mali?

    Answer. The United States strongly supports MINUSMA as the leading 
component of the international community's efforts to address the 
political and security crises in Mali, including by supporting the 
parties to make progress towards sustainable peace. MINUSMA also plays 
a critical role in the protection of Malian civilians and facilitating 
their access to basic services as well as humanitarian aid. The 
restrictions the transition government has imposed on MINUSMA, as well 
as the arrival of the Wagner Group, threaten the safety of MINUSMA 
peacekeepers and obstruct the implementation of the mission's mandate.

    Question. As U.S. Ambassador, if confirmed, how will you engage 
MINUSMA leadership to ensure that mandate of the mission is appropriate 
for the existing political and security environment in Mali?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will engage regularly with MINUSMA 
leadership to determine how the United States can best support the 
mission's efforts to carry out its mandate, including through 
advocating with the transition government to ensure MINUSMA's freedom 
of movement. I will encourage transparent and timely human rights 
reporting, performance reporting, and reporting on the restrictions 
placed on MINUSMA as well as host nation Status of Forces Agreement 
violations. I will work with colleagues in Washington to ensure that 
MINSUMA's mandate and resources are aligned with the current realities 
and challenges on the ground.

    Question. As U.S. Ambassador, if confirmed, how will you engage 
with leadership in the Africa Bureau at the State Department to ensure 
the mandate of MINUSMA is appropriate for the existing political and 
security environment in Mali?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will provide colleagues in the Bureau of 
African Affairs with the on-the-ground perspective necessary for the 
Department to assess the mission's effectiveness and inform the 
interagency policy process. I will be an active participant in 
Department and interagency discussions on the future of MINUSMA.

    Question. As U.S. Ambassador, if confirmed, how will you engage 
with leadership in the International Organization Affairs Bureau at the 
State Department to ensure the mandate of MINUSMA is appropriate for 
the existing political and security environment in Mali?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will provide colleagues in the Bureau of 
International Organization Affairs with the on-the-ground perspective 
necessary for the Department to assess the mission's effectiveness and 
inform the interagency policy process. I will be an active participant 
in Department and interagency discussions on the future of MINUSMA. I 
will gladly host members of the MINUSMA monitoring and evaluation 
missions in Bamako or virtually if necessary and ensure they receive 
access to all relevant interlocuters in MINUSMA and the transition 
government to inform their report on the status of MINUSMA and its 
ability to implement its mandate.

    Question. Do you commit to being consistently engaged with 
interlocutors in Mali, as well as with the Office of the Special 
Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs on U.S. efforts to secure the 
release of U.S. citizen hostages Jeffery Woodke and Sister Tennyson?

    Answer. I am already acquainted with Special Presidential Envoy 
Carstens and his staff, and while we could not discuss the cases, I 
expressed my commitment to coordinate with him and other stakeholders 
consistently regarding efforts to secure the release of U.S. citizen 
hostages. The Department of State has no greater responsibility than 
the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas. If confirmed, I 
commit to raising this important issue consistently with interlocuters 
in Mali.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you engage with the host 
government on anti-trafficking work? Please describe these efforts in 
detail.

    Question. If confirmed, I will stress the importance of tackling 
human trafficking and related issues with the transition government, 
which faces an automatic downgrade to Tier 3 next year. I will advocate 
for the National Transition Council to amend the 2012 anti-trafficking 
law to ensure that it can be used to effectively investigate and 
prosecute trafficking offenses involving hereditary slavery, and 
sentence convicted slaveholders to significant prison terms. 
Additionally, Mali continues to struggle with recruitment and use of 
children by non-state armed groups supported by the transition 
government. These groups have signed action plans with the United 
Nations, and I will vigorously advocate for their full implementation 
and the cessation of all unlawful recruitment and use of children.

    Question. According to the State Departments 2021 Human Rights 
report, Mali had significant human rights issues including arbitrary 
killings, forced disappearance, serious restrictions on free expression 
and media, targeting minority groups, among other serious incidents.

   If confirmed, how will you engage with the host government on these 
        issues?

    Answer. Respect for human rights is critical to a free and peaceful 
society. If confirmed, I will advocate for the full respect of human 
rights with the transition government, support civil society and a free 
media, and, in the spirit of ``do no harm,'' meet with members of 
minority groups to seek their advice on how the U.S. Embassy can best 
support them. I will highlight the allegations of human rights abuses 
and violations committed by the Malian Armed Forces in cooperation with 
the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group, which are counterproductive to a 
viable counterterrorism operation that should seek to protect 
civilians.

    Question. Do you commit to raising these issues directly?

    Answer. If confirmed, I am committed to raising credible reports of 
human rights abuses and violations directly to the highest levels of 
the transition government to increase accountability for those 
responsible.

    Question. What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission 
Bamako?

    Answer. I understand morale at Embassy Bamako is high despite a 
challenging living and working environment. The challenges have pulled 
the team closer and only enhanced interagency cooperation.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Bamako?

    Answer. The wellbeing of our people is paramount. If confirmed, I 
will make maintaining morale of utmost importance. I will work closely 
with my staff, understand their concerns about morale, and communicate 
those concerns back to Department leadership. In my experience, the 
best work comes from well-resourced teams that support one another in 
their work towards achieving common goals and advancing U.S. policies. 
If confirmed, I will maintain clear communication and articulate goals 
and priorities early on and often. I will work across the interagency 
and with Washington to ensure that future growth meets U.S. strategic 
objectives and can be supported effectively by post's management 
platform.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Bamako?

    Answer. I will involve everyone in creating our strategy and have 
buy in at all levels. I will lead by example and empower my team. If 
confirmed, I intend to ensure that all employees working in Embassy 
Bamako, whether they are Locally Engaged Staff, eligible family 
members, or U.S. direct hires, feel supported and heard in their work. 
I maintain an open office policy and welcome the contributions and 
ideas of those working in our mission. I will also actively support 
Embassy Bamako's existing mentorship programs for first and second tour 
officers, mid-level U.S. direct hires, and our Locally Employed Staff 
and ensure that they meet the professional development needs of staff.

    Question. How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. My management style is to lead from behind. To let the 
experts do their work while providing enough guidance so that there are 
no misunderstandings. I like to collaborate and make sure I provide 
everything in my power so that my team can get the job done. I am a 
positive person and I like to find the best in everyone. I like to 
coach, not coerce. I am also empathetic in my approach to leading 
teams. If confirmed, I will prioritize collaboration and partnerships, 
including from Congressional representatives, to achieve U.S. policy 
priorities in Mali. I am willing to give my time and myself to better 
my team. My management principles are as follows:


   Act like a leader--Take action and glean insights on the results of 
        those efforts. Share everything seen and heard with teammates.

   Regulate yourself--EQ is twice as important as technical skills and 
        IQ in driving performance and achieving success. Control 
        emotional outbursts and redirect them in more productive ways

   Become self-aware--Ask for feedback from colleagues. Effective team 
        performance begins with how the leader sees the situation.

   Be persuasive--Establish credibility through expertise and 
        relationships. Reinforce your position with numerical data and 
        stories. Connect emotionally with your audience.

   Coach the team you have, not the team you want. Most of us will not 
        have the luxury of inheriting our ``dream team''. We can 
        encourage and bring out the best traits of our team members and 
        find that rewarding in itself.

   Surround yourself with people that fill your gaps.  You want a team 
        that complements you. Lack of diversity on a team can create an 
        echo chamber that keeps you from being aware of crucial issues 
        impacting your business.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No, I do not.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. I hope to have a wonderful and honest partnership with my 
Deputy Chief of Mission. We will work as a true team to ensure the U.S. 
Mission in Mali is best placed to advance U.S. interests.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will entrust my DCM with the 
responsibilities akin to those of a chief operating officer. While both 
the DCM and I will have responsibility for coaching and mentoring the 
Embassy team, if confirmed, I will also ask the DCM to play the primary 
role in ensuring the career development of the first- and second-tour 
officers on the Embassy team. And I will be open to any ideas that the 
DCM has about functions in which s/he is particularly interested or 
where s/he has particular strengths.

    Question. Do you believe that it is important to provide employees 
with accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order to 
encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their 
roles?

    Answer. Yes, I do.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes, I will.

    Question. In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our 
embassy walls enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. Restrictions on movement due to the security environment 
have made outside meetings challenging but I understand diplomats at 
Embassy Bamako are still able to regularly meet contacts and provide 
robust, well-informed reporting to the Department. If confirmed, I will 
listen to my team to understand what resources they need to increase 
in-person interactions. outside Embassy walls. There must be a balance 
between mission, security concerns, and COVID-19 mitigation. I see 
great value in leaving the embassy compound and am committed to 
ensuring the safety of my teammates. If in-person interactions are 
unsafe, I will provide technological support to my team so that they 
are still able to fully accomplish our mission.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will listen to my team to understand what 
resources they need from the State Department to increase in-person 
interactions. If in-person interactions are unsafe, I will provide 
technological support to my team so that they are able to meet 
virtually with their contacts.

    Question. What is the public diplomacy environment like in Mali?

    Answer. The United States is very visible in all areas of public 
diplomacy in Mali: traditional media, social media, education, and 
cultural programs. The U.S. Embassy has strong relationships with media 
professionals in both state-owned and private media, including through 
the offering of trainings and exchange opportunities. Voice of 
America's Bambara-language service is a popular and trusted source of 
information for many Malians. As for social media, the U.S. Embassy's 
Facebook page is one of the most followed official pages in the 
country. Over the past year, Malian social media has become thoroughly 
infested with disinformation, much of it anti-Western and/or pro-
Russian. Kremlin-linked proxies exploit instability to gain influence, 
particularly through disinformation and the deployment of the Wagner 
Group forces. The onslaught of disinformation has made some parts of 
the Malian public more skeptical about U.S. policies, but many Malians 
are still very positively disposed towards the United States. The 
demand for U.S. help in promoting the teaching and use of English in 
schools, the media, and the business environment is insatiable, 
especially as Malians are seeking to diversify partnerships away from 
reliance on France. The network of exchange alumni, especially those of 
the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) Mandela Washington 
Fellowship, are force multipliers for the United States. The demand for 
spaces in U.S. exchange programs is magnitudes beyond the spaces 
available.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. The deteriorating security environment creates the most 
challenging obstacles to U.S. public diplomacy. Most public diplomacy 
work outside of Bamako relies on implementation through grant partners. 
Virtual programs to reach audiences outside the capital are hampered by 
poor internet quality and expensive internet. Given the burgeoning 
youth population (one of the youngest populations in the world), the 
number of positions in youth exchange programs cannot come close to 
meeting demand. The proliferation of disinformation has transformed the 
information landscape in ways unfavorable to U.S. interests. Not only 
has the Prigozhin enterprise deployed considerable resources to turn 
public opinion against France, Europe, and MINUSMA, but many Malians 
have enthusiastically taken to creating homegrown disinformation. A 
network of self-proclaimed ``pan-Africanists,'' some of whom with 
confirmed links to the Kremlin, from across Africa have taken up the 
anti-French, pro-Russian cause and have turned Mali into a testing 
ground for spreading this contagion to neighboring countries. WhatsApp 
has become the most efficient--and most difficult to track--vector for 
spreading narratives inimical to U.S. interests. Facebook is widely 
used to propagate disinformation. TikTok is becoming a new tool for 
reaching youth with hostile content. The U.S. diplomats based in Bamako 
do not have the tools, staffing, and resources to counter this 
coordinated information operation. Rising influence of the People's 
Republic of China (PRC) is also an issue to watch. While the PRC's 
presence is most obvious in the economic sphere, the PRC is also 
growing in influence in the public diplomacy space. For example, the 
Confucius Institute at the largest public university is well-resourced 
and very popular with students. The PRC has also played a large role in 
financing and constructing the new public university campus on the 
outskirts of Bamako, while the United States just this year opened a 
modest American Corner on that same campus.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. I believe both Main State and our mission in Bamako have 
important roles to play when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences. Public diplomacy officials on the 
ground can use close relationships with local media to reach a broad 
array of Malians with our messaging. Officials in Washington--with a 
wider audience--offer a platform to amplify this messaging. If 
confirmed, I will ensure our mission and Main State coordinate on 
messaging to ensure it is as effective as possible.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes. I am deeply troubled by potential anomalous health 
incidents that have affected U.S. Government personnel and their family 
members. Serving one's country overseas should not come at the cost of 
one's health. I agree that such incidents may pose a threat to the 
well-being of U.S. personnel and must be taken extremely seriously. If 
confirmed, the health, safety, and security of Embassy staff, their 
family members, and all those supporting the mission will be my highest 
priority.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Bamako personnel?

    Answer. If confirmed, I am committed to regularly share new 
information on this issue consistent with ensuring the integrity of 
ongoing investigations.

           to Rachna Sachdeva Korhonen by Senator Todd Young

    Question. If confirmed, how would you encourage the transition 
government to adhere to its agreement with ECOWAS for a 24-month 
political transition?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue to stand firmly with the 
Malian people in their aspirations for democracy, peace, development, 
and respect for human rights. I will press the transition government to 
keep its promise to return the country to the Malian people through 
democratic governance. The reforms the transition government seeks to 
undertake, such as constitutional reform, will build a foundation for a 
stronger, more responsive democracy in Mali, and, if confirmed, I will 
encourage the transition government to undertake these reforms 
expeditiously. I will also caution them that some reforms are the work 
of generations and will need to be handed over to a democratic 
government. I echo Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield's observation 
``that a Mali isolated from its community of nations and ECOWAS is not 
where Mali wants to be.'' I share her wish to work with the Malian 
transition government to bring Mali back into the community of nations 
where it belongs. In order to rebuild relationships with its neighbors, 
the transition government first needs to demonstrate commitment to the 
transition timelines and work transparently with ECOWAS special envoy 
Goodluck Jonathan and the transition monitoring committee. If 
confirmed, I will seek to assist the transition government as it moves 
towards the constitutional referendum and elections, but we must see 
progress.

    Question. To what degree do you assess that U.S. adversaries and 
their actors, such as the Wagner Group, successfully operate in Mali?

    Answer. Russia enjoys a burgeoning relationship with the transition 
government, evidenced by numerous ministerial trips by transition 
government members to Russia in recent months. The Wagner Group, 
through its partnership with the Malian Armed Forces (FAMa), is 
participating in operations in the country. Ultimately, 1,000 Wagner 
forces will not achieve what 5,000 French forces could not. The tactics 
Wagner has allegedly used in Moura and elsewhere have resulted in a 
spike in human rights abuses. Wagner will not bring peace to Mali.

    Question. Beyond support for international peacekeeping operations, 
what specifically would you do as Chief of Mission to discourage the 
Malian Government from relying on the aid of our adversaries--whether 
military or economic?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will share with my Malian colleagues the 
harm caused by Yevgeniy Prigzhoin and the Wagner Group in multiple 
contexts, including in Libya, Mozambique, Syria, and the Central 
African Republic. Countries that partner with Prigozhin and Wagner 
become weaker, poorer, more volatile and less secure. As a practical 
matter, leaders in such countries lose control of security operations 
within their territory. The steep costs in payments and mineral 
concessions that are demanded by Prigozhin's enterprises deprive 
national budgets and local citizens of critically needed resources. 
Prigozhin is best known for financing the Internet Research Agency 
(IRA), an entity that repeatedly attempted to interfere in the U.S. 
elections. Through companies that exploit Africa's natural resources, 
political operatives who undermine democratic actors, front companies 
posing as NGOs, and social media manipulation, Prigozhin spreads 
disinformation to influence African politics in the Kremlin's favor. 
The Wagner Group's alleged human rights abuses, including at Moura and 
Gossi, will only harm the transition government counterterrorism 
efforts by alienated the Malian people.
    If confirmed, I will call on the transition government to take 
action to facilitate responsible and accountable security assistance 
efforts aimed at protecting and empowering the Malian people.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you work as Chief of Mission to 
ensure continuing support of PEPFAR and other life-saving health 
programs?

    Answer. USAID has partnered with the Ministry of Health and Social 
Affairs, civil society, and private sector for over 60 years and 
remains Mali's largest bilateral health donor. Our health programs 
reach 80 percent of Malians. USAID's health programs focus on 
strengthening communities' capacity to protect their own health and 
strengthen the health systems that underpin successful expansion of, 
access to, and use of high impact primary health care services in the 
areas of maternal and child health, voluntary family planning, and 
disease prevention and control. I view these health initiatives, 
including PEPFAR, as vital to our efforts to promote a more stable, 
peaceful, and resilient Mali. If confirmed, I will endeavor to ensure 
these programs are supported so we can continue this critical work.

    Question. What is your view of the U.N. Peacekeeping Mission in 
Mali MINUSMA, the deadliest peacekeeping mission in the world, 
particularly given the post-coup environment in Mali? As U.S. 
Ambassador, if confirmed, how will you engage MINUSMA leadership, and 
leadership in the Africa and International Organization Affairs Bureaus 
at the State Department to make sure that mandate of the mission is 
appropriate for the existing political and security environment in Mali

    Answer. The United States strongly supports MINUSMA as the leading 
component of the international community's efforts to address the 
political and security crises in Mali, including by supporting the 
parties to make progress towards sustainable peace. MINUSMA also plays 
a critical role in the protection of Malian civilians and facilitating 
their access to basic services as well as humanitarian aid.
    The restrictions the transition government has imposed on MINUSMA, 
as well as the arrival of the Wagner Group, threaten the safety of 
MINUSMA peacekeepers and obstruct the implementation of the mission's 
mandate. The United States has urged the transition government to 
enable MINUSMA to carry out its mandate unimpeded. If confirmed, I will 
continue to advocate for MINUSMA in this regard.
    If confirmed, I commit to continuing the sustained, senior-level 
engagement Embassy Bamako conducts with MINUSMA, both on the Force and 
Civilian sides. I will also continue to advocate with the transition 
government for MINUSMA to be able to carry out its mandate unimpeded. I 
will provide colleagues in the Bureaus of African and International 
Organization Affairs with the on-the-ground perspective necessary for 
the Department to assess the mission's effectiveness and inform the 
interagency policy process.

    Question. In 2021, the Philippines had one of the highest per 
capita murder rates of land and environmental defenders in the world. 
What actions will you take as Assistant Administrator for the Bureau 
for Asia to ensure that USAID employees, including officers posted to 
the region, are trained on (1) effective engagement with environmental 
defenders and extractive industry or agribusiness companies; (2) how to 
manage conflict between these groups; and (3) how to encourage 
businesses to engage responsibly with critics of their activities?

    Answer. I have closely followed the Philippines for many years and 
am very familiar with the environmental and land defenders that you 
raise. I deeply admire their brave efforts in the face of very real 
danger in the Philippines. Their efforts are even more urgent in the 
face of the climate crisis, which impacts the Philippines in profound 
and numerous ways.
    If confirmed, I will work to ensure that all relevant USAID staff 
give this issue the urgent attention that it deserves. I will make sure 
our staff are aware of and able to connect defenders and supporting 
organizations to available resources in each country, including those 
that may be supported by the USG, and other like-minded partner 
countries and actors. I will also help USAID partner with counterparts 
in the Philippines to work toward minimizing conflict.

    Question. What actions will you take to push back against the 
authoritarian playbook of repression in the Indo-Pacific and make 
investments in democracy promotion, rule of law, and the protection of 
human rights?

    Answer. If confirmed, I plan to take several actions to push back 
against the authoritarian playbook of repression in the Indo-Pacific 
and make investments in democracy promotion, rule of law, and the 
protection of human rights. Following on from the Administration's 
successful first Summit for Democracy in December 2021, I understand 
that USAID is launching new global democracy, human rights, and 
governance (DRG) programs that will complement ongoing DRG programming 
that supports fundamental democratic practices across the Asia Pacific. 
I understand that these new and ongoing programs include objectives to 
promote election implementation and oversight, enhance civil society--
including women, youth, and labor engagements, bolster free media, 
fight corruption, build governing capacity, and strengthen the rule of 
law.
    Also, I understand that USAID will continue to promote transparent, 
accountable and responsive institutions that build sustainable 
democracy and counter corruption. I further understand that USAID will 
also work to maintain the integrity of information technology spaces, 
promote and protect civil and political rights, strengthen the 
integrity of electoral processes, and support democratic champions 
wherever they are.
    Using the strength of its field missions with dedicated career DRG 
officers, my understanding is that USAID focuses most of its assistance 
on bilateral programs managed by in-country staff.
    Programs and approaches vary according to the country's context. 
However, for issues that are better addressed regionally, I understand 
that the Asia Bureau develops programs that are managed either from 
Washington or its regional missions.

    Question. As noted in the Administration's Indo-Pacific Strategy, 
the Indo-Pacific is ``the epicenter of the climate crisis.'' If 
confirmed, how will you work with partners and allies to ensure the 
international community provides adequate funding to address issues of 
both climate change mitigation and adaptation in this vulnerable 
region?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with partners and allies to 
ensure the international community provides adequate funding to address 
issues of both climate change mitigation and adaptation in this 
vulnerable region. I understand that USAID helps to build climate 
resilience across Asia, assisting their partner countries to address 
climate impacts on their doorsteps and reduce their climate impacts. 
Their assistance helps reduce emissions, protect critical ecosystems, 
accelerate Asia's transition to renewable energy, and build resilience 
against climate shocks. Achieving climate results through non-climate 
programs is critical to mainstreaming climate. I also understand that 
USAID pursues secondary objectives with indirect adaptation, clean 
energy, or sustainable landscape results, where appropriate, while 
staying focused on their primary development purpose.
    The USAID Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership (PEP) is one 
example of a unique multi donor clean energy initiative, cost-shared in 
collaboration with Australia, Japan, and New Zealand. PEP's goal is to 
increase PNG's electrification rate from 13 percent to 70 percent by 
2030.

         to Rolfe Michael Schiffer by Senator James E. Risch\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Within the following set of additional questions and responses, 
there are questions for which Senator Risch requested a follow up 
response. The initial question did not change, so only the follow up 
response is printed here.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Question. Based on the strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, it's 
clear that the Taliban are providing sanctuary for Al Qaeda. In 
addition, recent U.N. reports indicate that the Taliban and Al Qaeda 
remain tied by ideology and marriage, and al Qaeda is actively 
reestablishing a presence in Afghanistan. Furthermore, the Taliban's 
human rights record is appalling as evidenced by a recent Amnesty 
International report titled Death in Slow Motion, which captures the 
plight of Afghan women and girls.

   How do you intend to strike the right balance between providing for 
        the needs of the Afghan people and preventing diversions to 
        terrorism or entrenching human rights abusers?

   What mechanisms are in place to avoid diversions to the Taliban or 
        Haqqani network?

    Answer. I understand that USAID has worked in challenging and 
conflict-affected areas throughout its history and that the Agency has 
drawn on experiences from its over 20 years in Afghanistan, and other 
challenging environments--including Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, and 
Colombia--to put in place strong oversight of U.S. Government 
assistance funds.
     I further understand that all USAID humanitarian assistance is 
channeled through U.N. and international non-governmental organization 
partners, predicated on validated humanitarian need and the 
vulnerability of the supported communities and that no USG humanitarian 
assistance is provided to or through Taliban authorities.
    I further understand that while USAID has legal authorizations in 
place to safeguard against sanctions violations, it still requires its 
partners to report any instances of diversion, fraud, waste, and abuse, 
including incidents involving the Taliban and Haqqani Network, and will 
suspend funding if necessary. Finally, I understand that USAID also 
vets key personnel of all of its implementing partners to ensure that 
no funds are diverted for nefarious purposes.

    Question. In the West Bank and Gaza, USAID has a formal definition 
of `direct benefit' that is operationalized in associated Mission 
Orders.

   What definition of direct benefit is USAID using in Afghanistan?

   Please describe the categories of USAID assistance to Afghanistan 
        and the intended goals of such assistance.

    Answer. ``Direct assistance'' is not defined legally and the term 
is not otherwise a term of art. I understand that USAID has been 
coordinating with the Department of State on application of the 
restriction and that State and USAID have agreed the scope of the 
restriction needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. I further 
understand that because the United States has not yet made a decision 
as to whether to recognize any entity, including the Taliban, as the 
Government of Afghanistan, the provision of assistance raises difficult 
questions regarding its potential application to Afghan Government 
entities (such as ministries, etc., which continue to exist and operate 
regardless of any U.S. recognition decision). It is my understanding 
that State and USAID expect that the restriction would apply to any 
assistance provided directly to the Taliban as a group and could also 
apply to entities controlled by the Taliban, depending on the 
circumstances.
    I understand that USAID is doing a great deal alongside its 
international partners to address Afghanistan's most urgent 
humanitarian needs. The United States is the largest single donor of 
humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, and targets its humanitarian 
assistance to the most vulnerable populations, focusing on provinces 
where levels of food insecurity are the most dire and where partners 
have an operational presence and the capacity to scale up.
    Humanitarian assistance is necessary, but not sufficient, to help 
Afghanistan become economically capable of supporting its population. 
Therefore, I understand that USAID classifies non-HA assistance into 
two main areas of support: 1: basic needs through support to 
livelihoods and agriculture, education, and health sectors; and 2: 
human rights, and importantly the rights of women and girls.
    In health, I understand that USAID programs support the COVID-19 
pandemic response; help maintain basic service delivery, particularly 
maternal health services, prenatal and neonatal care; and increase 
access to water, sanitation, and hygiene.
    I understand that livelihood assistance is helping to minimize the 
impact of economic disruption and instability on vulnerable households. 
Assistance is helping to increase production of food and staple crops--
such as wheat, soy, beans, and a variety of fresh fruits and 
vegetables, as well as the livestock and dairy sectors.
    It is my understanding that on human rights, USAID supports the 
rights of women, children, journalists, human rights defenders, persons 
with disabilities, and members of minority groups. Together with State 
Department colleagues, they continue to press the Taliban to 
immediately cease repressive abuses and human rights violations. If 
confirmed, I look forward to furthering these critical efforts.
    Finally, I understand that USAID has been able to sustain support 
to community-based education programs, private secondary and higher 
education programs, scholarships for Afghan students at the university 
level, and teacher training.

    Question. If confirmed, will you commit to upholding the statutory 
structure and organizational principles of the U.S. Agency of 
International Development (USAID), whereby the agency operates as an 
independent agency under the foreign policy direction of the U.S. 
Secretary of State?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I will uphold the statutory structure 
and organizational principles by which USAID formulates and executes 
U.S. foreign economic and development assistance policies and programs, 
subject to the foreign policy guidance of the President, the Secretary 
of State, and the National Security Council.

    Question. If confirmed, will you commit to working in a bipartisan 
manner with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, including by 
providing timely, accurate, and complete information on relevant U.S. 
foreign assistance programs in Asia?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I commit to working in a bipartisan 
manner with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, including by 
providing timely, accurate, and complete information on relevant U.S. 
foreign assistance programs in Asia.

    Question. If confirmed, will you commit to upholding a zero 
tolerance policy for waste, fraud, and abuse in the programs under your 
purview?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I commit to upholding a zero tolerance 
policy for waste, fraud, and abuse in the programs under my purview.

    Question. If confirmed, will you also uphold a zero tolerance 
policy for USAID staff and implementing partners who engage in the 
sexual exploitation and abuse of the vulnerable communities they are 
meant to serve?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I will uphold a zero tolerance policy 
for USAID staff and implementing partners who engage in the sexual 
exploitation and abuse of the vulnerable communities they are meant to 
serve.

    Question. USAID has a diverse workforce, supported by 22 different 
hiring mechanisms, that has been under enormous stress over the last 
few years, in large part due to persistent management challenges, 
budget uncertainty, and COVID-19 and its associated stresses. If 
confirmed, you will be responsible for overseeing 8 offices at 
headquarters, 15 bilateral missions in Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, 
Burma, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Kyrgyz Republic, Nepal, Pakistan, 
Philippines, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Timor-Leste, Uzbekistan, and 
Vietnam), and 3 regional missions (the Regional Development Mission for 
Asia in Thailand, the Pacific Islands Regional Office based in the 
Philippines, and the Central Asia Regional office based in Kazakhstan). 
A number of these missions, including but not limited to Afghanistan, 
face significant security and access challenges.

   What is your understanding of morale within the Bureau for Asia?

    Answer. If confirmed, one of my highest priorities would be to make 
the Asia Bureau's morale as strong as possible. From my interactions 
with Asia Bureau staff, it is evident that staff rightly take deep 
satisfaction and pride in their work, and are firmly committed to 
USAID's mission. However, it is my understanding that the impacts of 
the COVID pandemic, compounded by crises and violence in several 
countries, such as Afghanistan and Burma, have impacted the morale of 
Asia Bureau staff. Nevertheless, staff are persisting in their life-
saving and life-changing work.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale across the bureau?

    Answer. representatives from the Office of Human Capital and Talent 
Management to gauge the state of morale. I will conduct listening 
sessions to hear from staff across the Bureau, work with staff to 
develop a plan of action to address any issues identified, and set an 
implementation timeline with built-in feedback loops, if confirmed.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified vision across the 
bureau and its bilateral and regional missions, while also accounting 
for the areas of overlap with other agencies, bureaus, offices, and 
initiatives?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the staff to develop a 
strategic vision for the Bureau that provides for clear goals and 
objectives while promoting cross-collaboration among teams. I will 
empower teams to develop contextualized implementation plans with 
clearly stated goals and results that derive from and support the Asia 
Bureau strategic vision and its priorities. I will also work with 
Bureau staff to continually highlight the importance of our unified 
vision and the factors that make for a successful ``Team Asia'' and 
ultimately a successful USAID. Where necessary, I will strengthen the 
Bureau's various mechanisms for accountability and transparency, 
including performance reports, site visits, robust program evaluations 
and audits, if confirmed.

    Question. How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I would describe my management style as vision-driven and 
results-oriented. My goal is to create an inclusive, team-oriented 
environment where staff are held accountable for achieving results and 
feel empowered and supported by management. I believe in an inclusive, 
open, and collaborative approach to management, one that seeks to 
create an environment of constant feedback and learning for a culture 
that thrives on the free expression of ideas and unleashes the creative 
potential of the workforce. I believe in the importance of working 
across and with the entire organization to develop a shared strategic 
vision; translate that into practical, measurable implementable steps; 
align organizational resources and activities to do so--in an 
environment of shared ownership and mutual accountability. Clear 
communication, candid feedback and flexible decentralized decision-
making that empowers employees to own and direct their own work, that 
monitors accountability and facilitates implementation, and that 
recognizes that different individuals and teams have different needs, 
are, in my view, key to a management approach that can create a high-
performing, resilient and humane workplace.

    Question. In your view, how would your management style translate 
in a USAID setting, where your workforce is composed of career foreign 
and civil servants, as well as a dizzying array of political 
appointees, Foreign Service Limited appointments, Participating Agency 
Service Agreements, contractors, and grantees?

    Answer. My transparent and agile management style would allow me to 
effectively balance the Bureau's competing priorities while holding 
everyone accountable for achieving the overall Agency and U.S. 
Government foreign policy objectives. Although USAID has a variety of 
hiring mechanisms, it is a workforce that has a competitive edge in 
being united by a common goal and a shared mission. Given the complex 
and dispersed nature of many of USAID's programs, if confirmed, I 
intend to work with my colleagues to help create, build and sustain an 
organization for all employees at all levels, one that draws on our 
shared dependence and the commitment of all the members of the 
organization. I am also strongly of the view that diversity in a 
workforce, including diverse perspectives that come from different 
career experiences and modes of professional engagement only strengthen 
an organization, providing valuable insight that strengthen the ability 
of an organization to make better decisions, be more adaptive, and 
engage more effectively and creatively.

    Question. As a political appointee rather than career foreign or 
civil servant, do you believe it is incumbent upon Agency leaders to 
integrate themselves into bureau operations and culture? If yes, how do 
you intend to do so?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I intend to immerse myself in 
understanding the nuances of USAID by listening to the Bureau's 
workforce, both in DC and in the field, to ensure I fully understand 
the current objectives, programs, workstyle, and organizational 
strengths--and especially, given the challenges of the past several 
years and the changing nature of work, what the needs and aspirations 
of the organization look like within the broader construct of USAID 
operations, ambitions and culture. If confirmed, I plan to seek the 
views, perspectives and ideas of the widest possible range of staff and 
to work together with my team so that we can establish a clear vision 
and set of goals and objectives that is communicated throughout the 
bureau, to other elements of USAID and the USG, and to our implementing 
partners. I am acutely aware of the importance of understanding and 
being sensitive to different modes and methods of communication, 
aspirational thinking, and organizational habits--to marry the 
``policy'' goals that the Biden-Harris administration seeks to pursue 
with an appreciation of USAID ``process'' and ``practice'' (or, in 
other words, culture)--to get things done, and done in a way that 
creates positive feedback, virtuous cycles, a healthy, motivated 
workforce, and forward organizational momentum.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or in private?

    Answer. No, I do not believe it is ever acceptable or constructive 
to berate subordinates, either in public or in private.

    Question. In order to incentivize and ensure employee excellence at 
USAID, accurate performance reviews for all categories of employees are 
critical, though often lacking. Do you believe that it is important to 
provide employees with accurate, constructive feedback on their 
performance in order to encourage improvement and reward those who most 
succeeded in their roles?

    Answer. Yes, I believe that it is important to provide employees 
with accurate, constructive feedback on their performance in order to 
encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their 
roles.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage the 
managers in your bureau to provide clear, accurate, and direct feedback

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I would support and encourage the 
managers in the Asia bureau to provide clear, accurate, and direct 
feedback.18 deg.

    Question. Should the United States engage in highly risky public 
health research--such as gain-of-function research--in cooperation with 
countries that do not have adequate biosecurity standards, that have 
violated or failed to uphold the International Health Regulations, or 
where the United States cannot certify that such country is in 
compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention, including China?

    Answer. I understand that USAID has never approved any work, 
including in China, that aimed to increase the ability of infectious 
agents to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing 
its transmissibility (research known as ``Gain of Function '' studies).
    I understand that prior to selecting countries to engage with on 
public health research activities, USAID conducts an assessment of 
countries' capacity to responsibly conduct research by evaluating 
indicators that include but are not limited to, biosafety, biosecurity, 
IHR reporting compliance, willingness to share data, and political and 
security risks and that countries that underperform in these criteria 
are not selected for engagement.

            Follow Up Response
          Answer. I do not support USAID conducting research that would 
        make viruses more lethal or transmissible in cooperation with 
        such countries. Furthermore, it is my understanding that USAID 
        does not engage in such highly risky public health research in 
        any partner countries (research sometimes called ``Gain of 
        Function)'' and that USAID has not funded or conducted any 
        studies or experiments anywhere in the world that would make 
        viruses more lethal or transmissible.
          I understand that prior to selecting countries to engage with 
        on public health research activities, USAID conducts an 
        assessment of countries' capacity to responsibly conduct 
        research by evaluating indicators that include but are not 
        limited to, biosafety, biosecurity, IHR reporting compliance, 
        willingness to share data, and political and security risks and 
        that countries that underperform in these criteria are not 
        selected for engagement. If confirmed, I am committed to 
        requiring that compliance with the Biological Weapons 
        Convention is included as a country selection indicator.

    Question. If confirmed, will you ensure USAID's research and 
development grants for public health research in Asia are fully vetted 
and do not flow to partners or sub-grantees engaged in such research? 
How?

    Answer. I understand that USAID will build guidance into its Global 
Health Security projects that helps ensure implementing partners are 
adhering to rigorous biosafety and biosecurity protocols. I also 
understand that USAID requires regular reporting on implementing 
partners' activities supported with Agency funding, which must adhere 
to the criteria laid out in the award. If confirmed, I will ensure that 
USAID continues to provide active review and oversight of awards made 
with Agency appropriated funds to monitor activities and the use of 
funds, and that funds do not support enhanced Potential Pandemic 
Pathogen research (i.e. research that makes a potentially pandemic 
virus more transmissible or pathogenic) through either the prime or 
sub-partners.

            Follow Up Response
          Answer. Yes. I understand that USAID fully vets partners that 
        receive public health research funding. I understand that in 
        accordance with USAID's Operational Policy (ADS 303.3.9 Pre-
        Award Risk Assessment), this vetting includes, but is not 
        limited to, requiring a USAID Agreement Officer to verify that 
        the partner:

     does not have active exclusions in the System for Award 
            Management (SAM) (beta.sam.gov);

     does not appear on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) and 
            Blocked Persons List maintained by the U.S. Treasury for 
            the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC: http://
            www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDNList/Pages/
            default.aspx); and

     is not listed on the United Nations Security designation List 
            (online at: http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/aq--
            sanctions--list.shtml) prior to making an award.

          If confirmed, I look forward to engaging with Agency 
        leadership and with you on this issue.
          I also understand USAID is building guidance into its Global 
        Health Security projects with a life sciences focus to ensure 
        implementing partners are adhering to rigorous biosafety and 
        biosecurity protocols. Further, I understand that USAID 
        requires regular reporting on implementing partners' activities 
        supported with Agency funding, which must adhere to the 
        criteria laid out in the award. If confirmed, I will reinforce 
        USAID's continued practice of active review and oversight of 
        awards made with Agency appropriated funds to monitor 
        activities and the use of funds, and that funds do not support 
        enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogen research (i.e. research 
        that makes a potentially pandemic virus more transmissible or 
        pathogenic) through either the prime or sub-partners.

    Question. If confirmed, will you commit to ensuring full and 
complete compliance with current law, which prohibits the use of U.S. 
foreign assistance to perform or promote abortion as a method of family 
planning, support involuntary sterilizations, or lobby for or against 
the legalization of abortion overseas?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I commit to ensuring compliance with all 
applicable statutory restrictions relating to abortion and involuntary 
sterilization.

    Question. USAID, in coordination with the U.S. Department of State, 
manages United States contributions to COVAX.

   Do you agree that it is in the national interests of the United 
        States, and the interests of our partners in Asia, to ensure 
        that U.S. financial contributions to COVAX are not used to 
        underwrite the purchase and distribution of substandard Chinese 
        COVID-19 vaccines, particularly following the announcement that 
        COVAX would, in fact, begin making major purchases of Chinese 
        vaccines?

   If confirmed, how do you propose to counter China's vaccine 
        diplomacy--or bullying--in the region?

    Answer. Yes, I agree that it is in the interest of the United 
States and our partners for as many people as possible to be vaccinated 
with the highest-quality, U.S.-manufactured vaccines available. To that 
end, I understand that USAID and its interagency partners have 
delivered nearly 300 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to 26 countries 
in Asia. I also understand that most of the Agency's Indo-Pacific 
partners have specifically asked for U.S.-manufactured vaccines. It is 
also my understanding that the U.S. contribution to COVAX was not used 
to purchase vaccines made in the PRC. The Biden-Harris administration 
is dedicated to its efforts to vaccinate the world and ensure broad 
availability of safe and effective vaccines to more countries in need, 
through COVAX and bilaterally, and I believe others should do the same.
    I know that across Asia, USAID assists countries with vaccine 
readiness, vaccine advocacy campaigns, and vaccine delivery. From 
enhancing laboratory capabilities to installing liquid oxygen tanks, 
USAID's partnerships with the governments and people have enabled them 
to respond to COVID-19, strengthen health systems, and better prepare 
communities for future pandemics.
    The Biden-Harris administration supports the World Health 
Organization's goal of vaccinating 70 percent of the global population 
and pledged that the United States will be the world's vaccine arsenal. 
I understand that USAID plays a pivotal role in U.S. contributions to 
this goal by advancing the President's commitment to make 1.2 billion 
U.S.-made doses available for donation to low- and lower-middle-income 
countries. I understand that USAID will also continue to provide 
financial and technical assistance to deliver and administer vaccines 
through our leadership of the U.S. Government's Initiative for Global 
Vaccine Access (Global VAX), through which USAID has supported more 
than 100 countries.

            Follow Up Response
          Answer. It is my belief that the best way to counter the 
        PRC's efforts is for the United States to remain the world's 
        arsenal for vaccines, especially as there is a clear preference 
        for U.S.-made vaccines. To date, USG vaccine donations have 
        significantly outpaced those by the PRC. We also need to 
        continue being assertive in publicizing our contributions; we 
        must keep telling the story of how American innovation and 
        donations--our effective vaccines--have directly contributed to 
        easing the pandemic in communities around the world.
          The Biden-Harris administration supports the World Health 
        Organization's goal of vaccinating 70 percent of the global 
        population. I understand that USAID plays a pivotal role in 
        U.S. contributions to this goal by advancing the President's 
        commitment to make doses available for donation to low- and 
        lower-middle-income countries, and that the U.S. has been able 
        to meet vaccine demand for 116 countries who have requested 
        doses. I understand that USAID will also continue to provide 
        financial and technical assistance to deliver and administer 
        vaccines through our leadership of the U.S. Government's 
        Initiative for Global Vaccine Access (Global VAX), through 
        which USAID has supported more than 100 countries. If 
        confirmed, I will work with Congress to ensure these programs 
        are adequately funded.

    Question. USAID overseas missions have a long history of stretching 
the boundaries when it comes to permissible uses of PEPFAR funds.

   If confirmed, will you commit to working closely with the Office of 
        the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and Health Diplomacy (OGAC) at 
        the U.S. Department of State, USAID's Bureau for Global Health, 
        and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure 
        that USAID's efforts to combat HIV/AIDS in the region are 
        efficient, effective, aligned and complementary to the work of 
        OGAC?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to working closely with the Office 
of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and Health Diplomacy at the State 
Department, USAID's Bureau for Global Health, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, and other PEPFAR implementing agencies to 
ensure that USAID's efforts to combat HIV/AIDS in the region are 
efficient, effective, and aligned to PEPFAR's objectives.

    Question. There has been a strong focus over the last two years on 
multilateral institutions to address global challenges.

   Recognizing that multilateral and bilateral programs are meant to 
        work collaboratively, and that each have their own unique 
        strengths and challenges, what would you consider to be the 
        appropriate balance between multilateral and U.S. bilateral 
        foreign assistance programs in the region?

   How important to U.S. public diplomacy efforts is ``branding'' 
        United States foreign assistance in the region?

   Is working through multilateral or regional institutions worth the 
        trade-off when it comes to the loss of branding and other 
        public diplomacy opportunities in the region?

    Answer. I understand that in Asia, USAID will continue to engage 
like-minded partners directly, in-country, and through multilateral 
initiatives such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), U.S.-
Taiwan Pacific Islands Dialogue, U.S.-Japan-Australia Trilateral 
Infrastructure Consultation, the Trilateral Pacific Security Dialogue, 
and others. I further understand that USAID will continue to deepen its 
collaboration with Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of 
Korea, , and other like-minded partners and will seek to leverage its 
strong partnerships with regional institutions, including the Pacific 
Islands Forum, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and 
the Quad.
    On the issue of balance between multilateral and bilateral 
assistance, I believe that balance depends on the country and the goals 
to be achieved by the assistance. Bilateral assistance allows the USG 
to achieve goals that further U.S. foreign policy objectives, allows 
for greater accountability and provides visibility around the 
assistance delivered. However, there are advantages to using 
multilateral channels when striving to pool resources and advance a 
common global cause. For example, USAID may choose to provide 
assistance through multilateral organizations such as the case of Burma 
where humanitarian assistance providers' lives could be put at risk 
should the assistance be branded as USAID assistance. I also believe 
that a better option could be a hybrid model where assistance is 
provided to multilateral organizations but is earmarked for specific 
purposes providing USAID the advantages of both options.
    I believe appropriate branding sends a strong public diplomacy 
message, conveying that United States assistance is due to the 
generosity of the American people. If confirmed, I commit to complying 
with all USAID branding legal and policy requirements.

    Question. Successive administrations--both Democrat and 
Republican--have launched initiatives to ``localize'' U.S. foreign 
assistance, including by building the capacity of local partners to 
design programs and manage U.S. funds directly, rather than working as 
sub-awardees to large, U.S.-based development contractors and non-
governmental organizations. Each of these initiatives has had mixed 
results.

   What is your view of ``localization'' in the context of USAID's 
        work in Asia?

   How can the Bureau for Asia more effectively empower local partners 
        through its program consultation, design, and implementation 
        processes?

   Is it appropriate to set targets for ``localization'' and, if so, 
        what would you consider to be reasonable and appropriate?

    Answer. I support the vision of localization Administrator Power 
presented in her November 2021 speech at Georgetown University, ``A New 
Vision for Inclusive Development,'' in which she outlined USAID's 
commitment to build on past efforts in making its work more inclusive; 
and that the Agency will pursue this, in part, through localization. I 
understand that USAID will shift its programs and practices to expand 
and enhance its support for locally-led development, the process in 
which local actors--encompassing individuals, communities, networks, 
organizations, private entities, and governments--set their own 
agendas, develop solutions, and bring the capacity, leadership, and 
resources to make those solutions a reality. I agree with Administrator 
Power that around the world, when USAID's efforts are responsive to 
local priorities, and draw upon local capacities, diverse networks, and 
resources--results are more likely to be sustained by local 
organizations and institutions.
    For the Agency and the Asia Bureau, I understand localization to 
mean channeling a portion of development and humanitarian awards 
directly to local civil society, business, and other institutions that 
are supported by and accountable to local communities. It means 
changing the power dynamics that have historically characterized the 
relationships among local actors, international prime partners, and 
donors, with renewed focus on empowering local actors-and, within that 
goal, ensuring meaningful participation by marginalized populations, 
including women, people with disabilities, youth, indigenous 
populations, displaced persons, and ethnic and religious minorities.
    I think it is appropriate to set targets to help motivate and track 
the Agency's localization efforts. I understand that the targets that 
the Administrator announced in November--25 percent of USAID's funding 
going to direct local awards over four years and 50 percent of the 
Agency's activities incorporating good practices to put local actors in 
the lead over ten years-are global targets. If confirmed, I look 
forward to consulting with Congress and with the Bureau and Mission 
staff, to identify appropriate targets given the unique context of the 
region.

    Question. Many of our partners in the Indo-Pacific want to work 
with the United States on clean energy. However, they have to 
prioritize their immediate needs for power and distribution, and often 
that means continuing to rely on oil and natural gas. Indo-Pacific 
nations want to cooperate with the U.S. on energy sources like natural 
gas, but are running into roadblocks with their counterparts in this 
Administration.

   Do you commit that, if confirmed, you will advance policies and 
        programs with our partners that make sense for them given their 
        current energy needs?

   Do you commit that you will not reject outright cooperation with 
        partners on natural gas, other cleaner fossil fuels, or nuclear 
        energy, if that is what is practical for them to meet their 
        energy needs?

   What will inform how you approach technical assistance and other 
        capacity-building efforts with Indo-Pacific nations on energy?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I commit to advancing policies and 
programs with our partner countries that make sense for them and will 
not outright reject any development solution to help our partners to 
meet their energy needs.
    I understand that USAID has an adjudication process for reviewing 
fossil fuel projects under the Administration's International Energy 
Engagement Guidance. I am told that this guidance allows for support of 
carbon intensive energy sources necessary for geostrategic or 
development reasons when no other practical alternatives exist and the 
assistance will not prevent a country from meeting its decarbonization 
objectives.
    As I understand, USAID's approach to energy sector reform and smart 
growth is to provide partner countries with the tools and capability 
needed to evaluate all of their options through an integrated resource 
planning (IRP) methodology. In addition, I understand that USAID 
assists countries in establishing open, transparent, competitive 
procurement processes, in order to obtain clean, affordable, and secure 
energy supplies.

    Question. Do you commit to prioritizing infrastructure partners in 
the Indo-Pacific region, including through mechanisms such as the 
Infrastructure Transaction and Assistance Network and the related 
Transaction Advisory Fund?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. The President just announced the Project on Global 
Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), and you mentioned in your opening 
statement that you would be involved in its implementation.

   What is PGII's purpose?

   How will PGII and USAID existing infrastructure programs and tools 
        interact? Is PGII going to subsume any responsibilities of 
        USAID?

    Answer. As I understand, the purpose of the Partnership for Global 
Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is to forge values-driven, 
transparent, impactful partnerships to meet the enormous infrastructure 
needs of low- and middle-income countries and, in so doing, to advance 
the United States' and our allies' economic and national security 
interests-for example, the integrity of supply chains.
    PGII will mobilize strategic investments in areas vital to 
sustainable development and global security, including digital 
connectivity; climate and energy security; health and health security; 
and gender equality and equity. It will also mobilize strategic 
investment in hard infrastructure, like ports and rail.
    To do this, PGII will promote the execution of projects in 
consultation and partnership with host countries and local 
stakeholders, develop clean and climate-resilient infrastructure, 
advance transparency and accountability, and support the policy and 
institutional reforms that are key to creating the conditions and 
capacity for sound projects and lasting results. PGII will coordinate 
the full suite of tools across the U.S. Government, as well as the G7, 
other governments, the private sector, multilateral development banks, 
development finance institutions, and others.
    The U.S. aims to mobilize $200 billion for PGII over the next five 
years through grants, federal financing, and leveraging private sector 
investments. As part of the announcement of PGII, USAID launched three 
projects: Digital Invest, a USAID blended finance program that seeks to 
mobilize investment capital to expand internet access and digital 
financial services for traditionally underserved consumers in 
developing markets; The Healthcare Electrification and 
Telecommunication Alliance, which seeks to enhance health services and 
assist in COVID-19 response efforts by providing reliable, renewable, 
and affordable electricity for health care facilities across Sub-
Saharan Africa; and Care Infrastructure, a new multi-partner 
contribution to the World Bank's Childcare Incentive Fund to scale 
high-quality child care and early learning and empower women to 
participate in the global economy.
    If confirmed, I will closely examine alignment between PGII and 
existing programs such as the Infrastructure Transaction and Assistance 
Network (ITAN), which is a whole-of-government initiative to advance 
sustainable, transparent, high-quality infrastructure across the Indo-
Pacific region, and the Transaction Advisory Fund, which I understand 
the Asia Bureau manages as an interagency tool to provide transaction 
advisory services on strategic infrastructure projects in the Indo-
Pacific. If confirmed, I will ensure that all infrastructure tools and 
programs are complementary, non-duplicative, and deliver the best value 
for the US taxpayer.

    Question. With respect to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, 
what would be your top priorities if confirmed?

    Answer. I understand that USAID considers its Pacific neighbors 
essential partners in fostering a free and open Indo-Pacific region and 
that USAID works to address the region's most pressing challenges: 
climate change, access to transparent and high-standard infrastructure 
financing, digital connectivity, good governance and sustainable 
development.
    Working with Pacific Island countries to bolster their nature-based 
solutions, including conservation of critical ecosystems and 
sustainable management of fisheries, will strengthen livelihoods, 
support sustainable and healthy communities and ecosystems, and reduce 
the impacts of climate-related disasters.
    I understand USAID plans to continue to deepen its work with 
countries in Southeast Asia, and that USAID will also leverage its 
strong partnerships with development partners and regional 
institutions, including ASEAN, thePacific Islands Forum, the 
Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme, and the 
longstanding Pacific Community also known as SPC. Building and 
maintaining these partnerships will be essential to advancing 
Administration priorities such as addressing the climate crisis, 
recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, countering malign actors, and 
addressing Burma's humanitarian challenges while seeking to restore 
democratic governance.

    Question. With respect to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands] 
What do you see as major barriers to providing the right and most 
effective assistance and programming in these regions?

    Answer. Pacific Islands countries face a range of barriers, 
including small geographic size, isolation, and small populations. 
These factors contribute to the region's extreme vulnerability to the 
impacts of climate change and natural disasters as well as constrain 
the growth of their economies. I understand that USAID's approach to 
the Pacific Islands supports addressing the most pressing priorities of 
the region . These priorities include combating climate change, 
sustainable fisheries management, promoting energy security, expanding 
digital connectivity, supporting economic development, and fostering 
inclusivity and equality. Effective programming in this region requires 
working at both the regional level, where there are opportunities to 
drive collective action and ensure strong unity within key regional 
organizations, such as the Pacific Islands Forum and the Pacific 
Community, as well as at the bilateral level, using programming 
tailored to fit the unique context of each country.
    Countries across Southeast Asia are facing the immediate risks of 
climate change; rapid urbanization; and the overexploitation and 
contamination of life-sustaining resources of the land, air, and sea. 
Barriers remain to stronger regional connectivity, sustainable 
infrastructure development, and commitment to democratic principles and 
freedoms. Through sustainable, inclusive development partnerships such 
as the quadrilateral cooperation between Australia, India, Japan, and 
the United States (the Quad) and with the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN), I understand that USAID supports developing 
countries in Asia to realize their development goals and contribute to 
a more prosperous and peaceful world.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you prioritize USAID programming 
under the Countering Chinese Influence Fund (CCIF)? What will be your 
guideposts?

    Answer. Consistent with the FY 2022 State, Foreign Operations, and 
Related Programs Appropriations Act (SFOAA), if confirmed, my work on 
the Countering People's Republic of China Influence Fund (CPIF) will be 
done in close consultation with the designated Coordinator and Deputy 
Coordinator for the FY 2022 CPIF allocation process.
    My understanding is that USAID's priorities will align with both 
the wider U.S. Government strategy on China as well as the Agency's 
newly formed strategic approach to the People's Republic of China 
(PRC), with a focus on select economic, political, security, and 
technological sectors where PRC actions, influence, or messaging is 
most acute, is most detrimental to U.S. national security interests or 
those of our allies and partners, and where limited CPIF resources can 
have the greatest impact. While the PRC's efforts to displace the 
United States as the lead global power are a global, multi-sector 
threat, the Indo-Pacific remains the primary theater of competition and 
will receive strong consideration for CPIF resources.

    Question. In the last several years, the executive branch has 
notified Congress projects using CCIF money that is clearly an attempt 
to use China as a justification to fund programs they already wanted to 
do anyway and that have no discernible nexus to countering China. Do 
you commit that you will not contribute to this dynamic?

    Answer. I commit that, if confirmed as Assistant Administrator for 
the Bureau for Asia, I will work to ensure that proposals are closely 
aligned with one of four focus areas (sectors) for strategic 
competition: economic, political, security, and/or technology, and must 
articulate how the intended program will address a specific, negative 
PRC influence, action, or message resulting in a measurable impact

    Question. How will you use your leadership role, if confirmed, to 
ensure CCIF funds are used appropriately?

    Answer. If confirmed as Assistant Administrator for the Bureau for 
Asia, I commit to engaging with Congress as appropriate and necessary 
to ensure that the process is rigorous and that funds are used 
appropriately.

    Question. Should bureaus and offices in the Department of State and 
the U.S. Agency for International Development consider CCIF to be a 
$300 million pot of money that they can use for whatever they want, 
regardless of whether it is connected to China?

    Answer. I understand that USAID received clear feedback from 
Congress on how to improve its process of the Countering PRC Influence 
Fund (CPIF) for FY 2022 and beyond. Per their recent Report to Congress 
on The Framework and Processes for Administering the Countering PRC 
Influence Fund, the Department of State and USAID's FY 2022 guidance 
requires successful proposals to articulate how the intended program 
will address a specific, negative PRC influence, action, or message 
resulting in a measurable impact.
    If confirmed, I will work, together with my counterpart at the 
Department of State, to ensure our teams apply rigorous standards to 
determine how CPIF funds will be used. If confirmed, I commit to 
further consulting with you on this issue.

    Question. In the context of CCIF, to what extent will you 
distinguish between projects that might strengthen our partners and 
those that counter explicit activity or influence by the People's 
Republic of China?

    Answer. I understand that CPIF is intended to provide the 
Department of State and USAID with resources to fund activities that 
strategically invest, align, and compete with the PRC's negative and 
inappropriate influence, actions, and messaging globally and provide 
our partners with diplomatic and development alternatives to the PRC's 
authoritarian model. In some instances, this can be accomplished by 
directly countering an explicit activity, influence effort, or 
messaging campaign by the PRC. In other instances, strengthening the 
systems, capacity and resilience of USAID partner countries to resist 
the PRC on their own can be equally as effective. Transparent, 
accountable systems based on a rules-based order inhibit the PRC 
development model, so strengthening those systems limits opportunity 
for the negative impact of the PRC. For example, both transparent 
public procurement systems and active civil society that hold 
politicians accountable for public asset declarations effectively 
decrease the opportunity for corruption, undermining inappropriate PRC 
influence.
    While both approaches are valid ways to achieve the same objective, 
I understand that all proposals will be expected to cite a specific PRC 
influence or behavior that harms U.S. interests or those of USAID 
partner countries; describe the specific, measurable outcome to be 
achieved using CPIF funds; and articulate how the proposal would 
achieve this outcome and the duration of the project's lifespan.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
            to Rolfe Michael Schiffer by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. With their absolute control of 
Chinese society and industry, the CCP could stop all of these 
destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the Chinese Communist Party a threat to the United States?

    Answer. Yes. The Chinese Communist Party aims to challenge the 
U.S.-led model characterized by democratic governance and open markets, 
which has succeeded at delivering vital public services equitably and 
preserving sovereignty. This model is the best system to build just, 
inclusive, and prosperous societies.
    Many of the actions that Beijing is pursuing are detrimental to 
U.S. national security and development interests. Across regions and in 
multilateral fora, the PRC is attempting to undermine U.S. investments 
in key development sectors ranging from natural resources management to 
human rights protection. This poses significant risks to U.S. partner 
countries' autonomy, stability, and prosperity, and requires us to 
confront the PRC from a position of strength-to be competitive when we 
should be, countering when we must be, and collaborate only when it is 
in our national interest.
    If confirmed, I would use all tools available to counter this 
challenge, such as working with USAID's Anti-Corruption Task Force and 
Center for Democracy, Human Rights and Governance to combat the CCP's 
corruptive practices and use of corrosive capital--which in part is how 
the PRC convinces countries to sign up to its Belt and Road Initiative. 
In contrast to the PRC's state-led backroom deals, if confirmed, I 
would further USAID's engagements with the private sector and civil 
society to counter the PRC's state-led development model that 
undermines the financial and resource independence of our partner 
countries.

    Question. Does the Chinese Communist Party undertake any activities 
that are beneficial to U.S. interests?

    Answer. As outlined in my response above, we are currently 
witnessing a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) unwilling to work for the 
greater good of populations around the world and take actions that are 
detrimental to U.S. interests.
    If confirmed, I would further USAID's activities in building 
resilient supply chains, combating forced labor, lessening trade 
distortions, and furthering democratic values.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China as 
part of your work?

    Answer. Such a pivotal cooperation decision would require extensive 
high level discussion in the Executive Branch and deep consultation 
with Congress. The law must be our guide: I am well aware of legal 
restrictions regarding assistance to the PRC and in the provision of 
U.S. assistance, including in appropriations legislation.

    Question. By virtue of its geography and a decades-long program of 
dam building, the Chinese Communist Party retains significant control 
over the Mekong River basin, a source of water, food, and energy for 
more than 65 million people. At the press of a button, the CCP could 
stop the flow of water to downstream countries, which would cause an 
unprecedented humanitarian crisis that would destabilize the region and 
send even more migrants to our unprotected southern border.

   Are you concerned with the prospect of a humanitarian crisis in the 
        Mekong River Basin caused by the Chinese Communist Party? 
        Please explain.

    Answer. I am always concerned about actions that the Chinese 
Communist Party could take that might negatively impact Indo-Pacific 
countries, especially those in Southeast Asia, and the United States.
    The cascade of dams built by the Chinese Communist Party exacerbate 
the impacts that climate change is already having on the health of the 
river and on the countries in the Mekong Basin.
    USAID has been instrumental in understanding the impacts of these 
dams, supporting the Stimson Center to develop and launch the Mekong 
Infrastructure tracker to better understand the spatial extent and 
impacts of dams and other infrastructure in the river basin. I 
understand that programs like SERVIR Mekong out of the Regional 
Development Mission for Asia, based in Bangkok, Thailand, have 
developed tools like digital rain gauges and vegetation assessments to 
track and document the ongoing changes within the basin. USAID programs 
provide the data and evidence to document the risks of further dam 
construction while supporting non-hydro renewable energy for downstream 
Mekong countries.
    I also understand that the impacts of dams on fisheries is the 
reason for the creation of the USAID ``Wonders of the Mekong'' program. 
I understand that this program works to understand fish movements 
throughout the Mekong systems, the impacts of the variety of dams on 
fish populations and advocates for environmental and social safeguards 
to protect a healthy Mekong ecosystem providing for the food security 
of the region.
    Finally, it is my understanding that USAID has long partnered with 
the ASEAN Secretariat's regional humanitarian response unit to 
strengthen ASEAN's ability to support disaster response in the region, 
both regionally and bilaterally. I further understand that USAID has 
teams on standby 24/7 all around the world, including in Southeast 
Asia, ready to deploy to a range of humanitarian crises.

    Question. How is the United States working with downstream Mekong 
countries to ensure these counties are resilient to the effects of a 
CCP-sparked humanitarian crisis?

    Answer. As I understand, one of USAID's most pressing priorities is 
to help partner countries, including those in the Mekong region, 
develop their capacity to be resilient to a range of crises.
    USAID, bilaterally and regionally, works towards resilience through 
agriculture and environment programs. I understand that USAID's efforts 
for resilience to the changes in river flows caused by the CCP and 
climate change include monitoring environmental conditions, early 
warning systems, and conservation. For example, on monitoring, the 
USAID-funded Mekong Infrastructure Tracker platform is the premier 
resource for researchers to track, monitor, and quantify the 
development of energy, transportation, and water infrastructure assets 
and the social, economic, and ecological changes they bring to 
Southeast Asia. On conservation, the Wonders of the Mekong Program in 
Cambodia is rearing endangered fish and releasing them in efforts to 
increase fish stocks and ecosystem health which contributes to 
Cambodians' food security.
    I further understand that USAID has long partnered with the ASEAN 
Secretariat's regional humanitarian response unit to strengthen ASEAN's 
ability to support disaster response in the region, both regionally and 
bilaterally. I also understand that the Vietnam Mission is specifically 
focusing on more bilateral work in the Mekong, including the Mekong 
Delta Coastal Habitat Conservation activity which was announced by Vice 
President Harris during her visit to Vietnam in 2021.

    Question. If confirmed, what types of programming do you recommend 
USAID support in Mekong River countries to further ensure these 
countries are resistant to water shocks?

    Answer. As I understand, USAID has been tracking the impacts of 
large-scale hydropower dams and climate change on the Mekong River 
Basin through a variety of activities.
    I understand that USAID works with countries in the Lower Mekong 
region, as well as the Mekong River Commission (MRC), to build capacity 
to address water shocks and other adverse environmental impacts. For 
example, the USAID SERVIR-Mekong initiative, a partnership with NASA, 
harnesses remote sensing technology and open data to help address 
development challenges related to a changing climate. I also understand 
that the MRC recently endorsed USAID SERVIR-Mekong's flood forecasting 
and reservoir assessment tools, improving climate resilience across the 
Lower Mekong. I understand that USAID SERVIR-Mekong partnered with the 
MRC to develop decision support tools that assist member countries to 
better prepare for and respond to floods and droughts.
    I further understand that the USAID-supported Wonders of the Mekong 
Program has generated new insights on the drought-flood cycle in 
Cambodia. This new research, which has been featured in National 
Geographic and other major outlets, has resulted in the Government of 
Cambodia calling for a moratorium on dams. The Cambodian Government has 
also prohibited the cutting of flooded forests which will contribute to 
improving the health of the Mekong River system and the communities 
dependent upon them.
    I further understand that through the Partnerships for Enhanced 
Engagement in Research (PEER) activity, USAID supports a network of 
Lower Mekong scientists to better understand the impacts of hydropower 
and climate change on Mekong fisheries. This network of scientists is 
positioned to improve fisheries management by characterizing genetic 
diversity and spatial structure as well as establishing long-term 
monitoring of important fish species in Cambodia, Laos, Burma, 
Thailand, and Vietnam. The scientists are working to understand the 
impact of rapid hydroelectric development in the Lower Mekong Basin on 
fisheries.

    Question. In contrast to the Chinese Communist Party, which 
continues to have strained relations with many of its neighbors, 
foreign assistance provided by the United States has enabled its allies 
and partners to become foreign assistance providers themselves. The 
Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and Japan's 
International Cooperation Agency (JICA) have provided assistance and 
support to countries in Southeast and Central Asia. Even Mongolia, 
which only 30 years ago was a satellite of the Soviet Union, has 
established its own international development agency to promote 
democracy in other Central Asian states. A vision of a truly free and 
open Indo-Pacific is only possible when U.S. allies and partners 
cooperate with us in achieving this goal.

   To what extent can USAID cooperation with Asian development 
        agencies the impact of U.S. foreign assistance? What programs 
        have and have not worked previously?

    Answer. I understand that USAID's development assistance to the 
Republic of Korea decades ago not only helped the country develop into 
the global leader that it is today, but it also helped the country 
develop its own very capable international development agency.
    Cooperation with Japan advances U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific 
and beyond. I understand that USAID works to align development policy 
and resources with Japan to enhance development impacts with like-
minded allies through diplomatic efforts in Washington, DC and through 
the USAID Senior Development Counselor to Japan and Korea.
    Finally, my understanding is that USAID has made a strategic 
decision to work with key emerging leaders in the Indo-Pacific to help 
them strengthen their own development agencies, including India, 
Thailand, Kazakhstan, and others. Strengthening our Indo-Pacific 
partners' ability to improve their neighbors' development is good 
strategy, good diplomacy, and good for the U.S. taxpayer.

    Question. USAID currently manages co-funded programs with 
Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in countries like 
Sri Lanka and the Maldives. To what extent can this model inform joint 
projects with Korea and Japan's foreign aid agencies?

    Answer. I understand that collaborating with like-minded donors, 
including Australia, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, is one of 
USAID's highest imperatives. These partnerships allow USAID to maximize 
its development investments and programming by avoiding duplicative 
efforts and promoting policy alignment. It is good strategy, good 
diplomacy, and good for the U.S. taxpayer.
    My understanding is that USAID has strong existing relationships 
with Japan and the Republic of Korea, and works closely with both 
Ministries of Foreign Affairs, the Japan International Cooperation 
Agency (JICA), the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and 
other government and private sector stakeholders.
    I understand that USAID is engaged in a number of co-funded 
programs with the Republic of Korea and Japan, including the USAID-
KOICA Climate Resilient Cities as well as the Marine Litter activities 
and the Japan-Power Africa collaboration. I understand that USAID plans 
to build on the successes of such collaborations with the Republic of 
Korea and Japan by incorporating the lessons learned that the Agency 
has gleaned from our bilateral engagements with DFAT and other like-
minded partners. I look forward to contributing to these efforts, if 
confirmed.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to encourage greater USAID 
cooperation and coordination with Korea and Japan's foreign aid 
agencies?

    Answer. My understanding is that USAID has strong existing 
relationships with Japan and Korea, and works closely with both 
Ministries for Foreign Affairs, the Japan International Cooperation 
Agency (JICA), and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), 
among other key Japanese and Korean stakeholders. I understand that 
USAID's Senior Development Counselor for Japan and Korea, based in 
Embassy Tokyo, is working to strengthen the Agency's strategic 
engagement with the Japanese Government, and is similarly focused on 
growing USAID's relationship with the Korean Government.
    I also understand that USAID has frequent engagement with Japan's 
and Korea's embassies, JICA, and KOICA in the field, and will continue 
to build and capitalize on this partnership.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
            to Rolfe Michael Schiffer by Senator Todd Young

    Question. What actions has USAID taken since Administrator Power's 
confirmation to streamline USAID's hiring processes to develop the next 
generation of American development and assistance professionals?

    Answer. USAID is committed to strengthening its global workforce to 
advance the Agency's mission and national security priorities. However, 
my understanding is that USAID's staffing has not increased at the same 
rate as its programmatic needs and requirements. USAID has complex 
requirements and needs to increase both the size and agility of its 
career workforce while also streamlining non-career employment 
mechanisms.
    I understand that the Global Development Partnership Initiative 
(GDPI) is the starting point for a strategic workforce effort to 
finally align USAID's workforce needs with its workforce supply, 
particularly around direct-hire staffing. I understand that at the end 
of FY 2021, USAID completed a successful hiring surge to reach the 
previous staffing appropriations levels of 1,850 FS and 1,600 CS 
positions. However, given the significant expansion of USAID's work 
around the world, I understand that the Agency estimates its real 
staffing requirements are significantly higher in both Foreign Service 
and Civil Service categories.
    I further understand that USAID's Office of Human Capital and 
Talent Management (HCTM) is focusing on hiring efforts to streamline 
and diversify the Agency's hiring processes. For example, as part of 
USAID's General Schedule (GS) process, I understand that HCTM is 
developing a hiring manager guide and conducting webinars to educate 
hiring managers across USAID on their role, non-competitive hiring 
authorities, and timelines in the hiring process.
    I understand that USAID is working to attract and retain the 
brightest minds that will help the Agency achieve its mission by 
engaging and recruiting diverse quality talent through targeted 
outreach and recruitment events, including via efforts to expand and 
maintain partnerships with organizations serving underrepresented 
groups to source eligible candidates for employment opportunities. I 
further understand that USAID has expanded its talent sourcing efforts 
by partnering with organizations that serve persons with disabilities 
and veterans to source candidates eligible for non-competitive 
employment consideration. If confirmed, I look forward to supporting 
these efforts.

    Question. Noting food supply disruptions as a result of the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine, what tools can Congress provide to ensure USAID 
can fulfill its mission?

    Answer. I understand that the generous resources provided by 
Congress through the Ukraine supplemental appropriations bills have 
been critical to USAID's ability to scale up humanitarian and 
development assistance to respond to the food security crisis resulting 
from Russia's unjustified invasion of Ukraine. However, given the scale 
of global food insecurity and the dynamic nature of its causes, it is 
imperative that USAID fully optimize its programs and be able to employ 
the best food assistance modalities to respond to each context. I 
understand that the reauthorization of the Farm Bill may provide an 
unparalleled opportunity for Congress and USAID to work together to 
ensure the U.S. Government has the best tools at its disposal to meet 
the humanitarian challenges of the day. If confirmed, I look forward to 
working with colleagues across the Agency on these issues and to 
consulting with Congress on these issues.

    Question. Given the confluence of so many crises, where should 
USAID look to first prioritize its efforts?

    Answer. I understand that the Agency's priorities for Asia are 
guided by President Biden's 2022 Indo-Pacific Strategy, the Central 
Asia Strategy and the U.S. Interim National Security Strategy. From 
briefings with USAID career staff, I also understand that the Asia 
Bureau has released a pro-active and affirmative Indo-Pacific framework 
that will operationalize the President's Indo-Pacific Strategy with on-
going and planned USAID programs. If confirmed, I look forward to 
delving into the details of USAID's approach to the Indo-Pacific and to 
consulting with you on these issues.

    Question. Regarding U.S. strategy on Burma, if the military junta 
disrupts USAID's ability to interact with its implementing partners on 
the ground, how do you propose we work around this to guarantee a 
continuous supply of U.S. aid?

    Answer. USAID's robust work in Burma continues and is more critical 
than ever. USAID has historical and recent experience managing aid 
globally in unstable and conflict-affected environments. I understand 
that USAID continuously adjusts approaches and strategies on the ground 
to avoid aid bottlenecks. For example, I understand that the Agency has 
diversified and expanded its use of local partners who may have better 
access and fewer restrictions to deliver food aid and other assistance 
to vulnerable communities. Additionally, as publicly announced on 
February 11, 2021, just 10 days after the coup, I understand that the 
USAID Mission pivoted $42.4 million of FY 2020 bilateral assistance 
funds away from development work that could have benefited the military 
government. This shift, primarily within existing awards, increased aid 
to civil society and non-governmental actors across all sectors. I 
understand that since then, the Mission has continued this model to 
design and implement work across all sectors in ways that do not work 
through or benefit Burma's military government.
    On humanitarian assistance, I understand that the bulk of 
humanitarian assistance is delivered from within Burma despite 
increasing restrictions. I also understand that USAID's humanitarian 
assistance includes mobile health clinics, rehabilitation of water 
supply infrastructure, construction of sanitation facilities, 
protection services, shelter, nutrition support, humanitarian 
coordination, emergency cash, and relief items. I also understand that 
USAID continues to provide emergency and non-emergency food assistance 
to displaced populations and newly emerging areas of violence.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
         Submitted to Nathaniel Fick by Senator Robert Menendez

CHIPS+ Funding
    Question. Last week, Congress passed the CHIPS Act, which includes 
a provision that allocates $500 million over 5 years to the Department 
of State, which in coordination with USAID, the Ex-Im Bank, and the 
DFC, will be used for a CHIPS for America International Technology 
Security and Innovation Fund. The purpose of this funding would be to 
coordinate with partner countries ``to support international 
information and communications technology security.'' and ``.the 
development and adoption of secure and trusted telecommunications 
technologies, secure semiconductors, secure semiconductors supply 
chains, and other emerging technologies.''

   Will you commit to keeping this committee fully and currently 
        informed about the use of this funding?

    Answer. Yes. The CHIPS for America International Technology 
Security and Innovation Fund provides critical funding for 
international information communications technology security and 
semiconductor supply chain activities. If confirmed, I will commit to 
keep the Congressional stakeholders fully briefed on how the Department 
plans to use the CHIPS funding as well as provide regular program 
status updates.

    Question. What would be the CDP Bureau's top priorities when using 
this funding?

    Answer. The Department will support the use of CHIPS funding to 
promote semiconductor supply chain security and international 
information and communications technology (ICT) security aligned with 
the Administration's priorities. If confirmed, I would recommend 
prioritizing activities that promote cooperation on semiconductor 
supply chain activities with our allies and partners and encourage and 
incentivize countries around the world to choose trustworthy suppliers 
for their next-generation telecommunications network build outs, 
including for 5G. I would also work with allies and partners to promote 
a more diverse and resilient ICT supply chain, including through the 
promotion of new architectures such as Open Radio Access Networks.

National Security Presidential Memorandum 13
    Question. In 2018, the Trump administration issued National 
Security Presidential Memorandum 13, laying out U.S. Cyber Operations 
Policy, including the approval process for conducting offensive and 
defense cyber operations outside the United States.

   If confirmed, will you commit to ensuring that the appropriate 
        Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff gains access to this 
        document?

    Answer. I respect the committee's important oversight role in U.S. 
offensive and defensive cyber operations. If confirmed, I will convey 
the committee's interest in this document to the White House and will 
advocate for maximum transparency.

Sharing Cyber Capabilities with Partners
    Question. The FY 2023 NDAA contains a provision stating that ``the 
Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, 
shall conduct an assessment on sharing military cyber capabilities of 
the Armed Forces with foreign partners of the United States for 
immediate operational use to cause effects on targets or enable 
collection of information of targets.''

   How do you view the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Diplomacy's 
        role in coordinating cyber capabilities sharing with foreign 
        partners?

    Answer. The Department has long supported collaboration and 
cooperation with key partners and allies, where appropriate, on cyber 
operations where we share national interests. This collaboration occurs 
on a case-by-case basis; the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy 
supports increasing this collaboration. That said, the Department has 
neither an operational role, nor cyber capabilities itself to share 
with foreign partners. If confirmed, in close coordination with the 
Department of Defense and the other interagency partners, I will ensure 
foreign policy considerations are taken into account when evaluating 
the sharing of cyber capabilities with foreign partners, and that 
approved transfers take place as swiftly as possible.

CISA Global Strategy
    Question. Just two weeks ago, CISA opened its first attache office 
in London to ``serve as a focal point for international collaboration 
between CISA, UK Government officials, and other federal agency 
officials,'' and the agency continues to enter into memoranda of 
cooperation with foreign governments such as Ukraine in July 2022.

   Given these developments, how do you envision the CDP Bureau's 
        relationship the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
        Agency (CISA) evolving in the near and long-term? Where do you 
        view your areas of responsibility beginning and ending?

    Answer. The Department of State facilitates engagements between 
foreign governments and U.S. agencies with specific technical 
expertise, including through Embassies overseas. Many countries want to 
work with and learn from CISA, particularly because it houses the best-
in-class computer security incident response team with national 
responsibility. If confirmed, I would look to continue the Department's 
strong collaborative relationship with CISA, leveraging their expertise 
to help partners gain the capabilities for better incident response and 
critical infrastructure protection, including by working with the 
Department's cyber officers at our diplomatic missions, as I believe is 
intended by CISA's Global Strategy.

Digital Freedom and Human Rights
    Question. There is some concern that two subunits of the CDP 
Bureau--International Cyberspace Security and International Information 
and Communications Policy--will be headed by a Deputy Assistant 
Secretary, whereas the Digital Freedom Unit--the unit tasked to 
``defend against efforts to legitimize and adopt repressive and 
authoritarian practices in cyberspace''--is led by a coordinator with 
little support.

    Question. Given this organizational structure, how do you plan to 
elevate the issue of human rights in the new Bureau? Given that the 
Digital Freedom Unit is still located within DRL, how will do you plan 
to work with DRL on these issues?

    Answer. CDP and DRL are collaborative partners with complementary 
missions. DRL continues to lead the Department's work on Internet 
freedom to ensure that individuals can enjoy their human rights online 
as well as offline. CDP has an integrated mandate to lead on digital 
freedom, which provides a broader paradigm to address the intersection 
between technology and human rights at a time when technology continues 
to expand into new areas of our lives. If confirmed, I will empower 
CDP's Digital Freedom Team to promote meaningful access to digital 
technologies in order to preserve cyber stability and guard against 
digital authoritarianism by coordinating on these issues across all 
Department equities and engaging the interagency, international 
partners, and the multistakeholder community. I will ensure that the 
Digital Freedom Team receives the resources it needs to lead on this 
issue, including recognition of the Senior Coordinator as a Deputy 
Assistant Secretary equivalent.

    Question. While the Department of State has sought to centralize 
responsibility for its cyber diplomacy related activities in the new 
CDP Bureau, the Bureaus of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor and 
International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs will continue to 
have policy and programmatic responsibility for issues related to 
internet freedom and cybercrime.

   How will you ensure coherent State Department engagement on these 
        and other issues where there is a division of responsibilities 
        across bureaus?

    Answer. Before the establishment of the Bureau of Cyberspace and 
Digital Policy, its component offices successfully navigated the 
division of responsibilities regarding the leadership of the Internet 
freedom and cybercrime portfolios. If confirmed, I will continue to 
maintain the close, collaborative, and functional partnership between 
the CDP Bureau, DRL, and INL while ensuring that I bring the economic, 
national security, and digital freedom perspectives together to advance 
a future where everyone, everywhere, can harness the benefits of an 
open Internet and digital technologies to reach their full potential.

U.S. Leadership at Standards-Setting Bodies (ITU)
    Question. Part of the mission of the Bureau for Cyberspace and 
Digital Diplomacy is ``to advance policies that protect the integrity 
and security of the infrastructure of the internet.'' I included a 
provision in my Economic Statecraft for the 21st Century bill that 
would establish an interagency working group dedicated to enhancing 
U.S. leadership and representation at international standards-setting 
bodies such as the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which 
establishes international standards that are fundamental to the 
operation for today's information and communications technology 
networks. In the upcoming fall 2022 ITU Plenipotentiary Conference, two 
candidates, one from the United States and one from Russia, are running 
for the position of ITU Secretary General, and represent fundamental 
differences in their views on digital governance.

   What is the Administration doing to ensure that the United States 
        is represented not only in top-level positions at the ITU such 
        as Secretary General, but also at the ITU's lower-level 
        workshops, seminars, and study groups, which is where 
        recommendations and resolutions are sent up to the larger ITU 
        body for votes?

    Answer. Responsible, forward-looking, and transparent leadership of 
the ITU is vital to the U.S. telecommunications industry. The U.S. 
nomination of Doreen Bogdan-Martin as ITU Secretary-General is a 
critical piece of ensuring this strong leadership. Ms. Bogdan-Martin 
has spent the last 28 years in the ITU, working her way up the ranks, 
demonstrating how support for candidates at all levels is a winning 
strategy. If confirmed, I will work to ensure continued coordination 
with likeminded partners in promoting leadership candidates, including 
those of lower-level working groups and study groups to promote fair, 
transparent, and consensus-based approach to ITU's work on spectrum, 
standards, and telecommunications development. The Department, 
recognizing that vote splitting contributes to undesirable results, 
coordinates with allies and partners to maximize our chance of 
electoral victory. I thank Senator Risch for his report entitled ``A 
Concrete Agenda for Transatlantic Cooperation on China'' that reaffirms 
the importance of coordination.

Digital Authoritarianism and Cyber Sovereignty
    Question. Governments such as China and Russia have promoted the 
concept of ``cyber sovereignty'' in international fora in order to 
justify more restrictive measures on the Internet, including 
surveillance and censorship of political activists.

   Please describe your views on ``cyber sovereignty'' and its 
        implications for global internet governance.

    Answer. The concept of ``cyber sovereignty'' being advanced by 
countries like Russia and China has the potential to erode the current 
multistakeholder model of global Internet governance and the benefits 
of a global, distributed Internet for all. Proponents of ``cyber 
sovereignty'' are engaging in restrictive measures-such as surveilling 
and censoring their citizens and activists-or seeking to bring the 
Internet under greater inter-governmental control, such as through the 
UN. For decades, the multistakeholder model has underpinned the 
Internet's global growth and its success as a platform for free 
communication, ensuring that no single entity--governmental or 
otherwise--controls the Internet. If confirmed, I will uphold the U.S. 
vision of the open, interoperable, secure, and reliable Internet under 
the global, multistakeholder model and will oppose efforts to undermine 
it.

Transparency for ``Hunt Forward'' Operations
    Question. According to National Security Agency Director Paul 
Nakasone, ``50 different hunt forward operations were conducted in 16 
countries over the past three years,'' all being ``instances where 
countries invite CYBERCOM to test their systems against theoretical 
attacks.'' One of the recommendations made in a report you co-chaired 
for the Council on Foreign Relations titled ``Confronting Reality in 
Cyberspace: Foreign Policy for a Fragmented Internet'' was ``to adopt 
great transparency about defend forward actions.''

   If confirmed, as the principal cyberspace policy official within 
        the Department of State, how do you intend to work towards 
        greater transparency for ``hunt forward'' operations?

    Answer. As the report recommends, proactive transparency and 
information sharing could give the United States first-mover advantages 
in the information space. U.S. statements on self-restraint and 
defensive initiatives should be part of our strategy to disrupt and 
mitigate adversarial cyber operations below the level of armed 
conflict. In recent years, the Department of Defense has been more 
proactive and public about discussing its ``hunt forward'' operations, 
which is a positive development. If confirmed, I intend to work closely 
with the Department of Defense and promote ``hunt forward'' operations 
as defensive measures that enhance partnership with foreign 
governments, counter cyber threats, and promote stability in 
cyberspace.

    Question. Will you commit to consulting with this committee on 
significant developments and decisions with respect to the planned 
Special Envoy for Critical and Emerging Technologies?

    Answer. If confirmed, I anticipate that I will work in close 
collaboration with the planned Special Envoy for Critical and Emerging 
Technology. The State Department team will continue to keep the 
committee informed about the planned Office of the Special Envoy for 
Critical and Emerging Technology.

IT Workforce and Tech Talent Pipeline
    Question. Given that approximately 700,000 cybersecurity roles 
remain vacant in the United States, it is clear that our country faces 
a growing national security challenge when it comes to cybersecurity. 
The Biden administration underscored the urgency of this issue in July 
2022 by convening the National Cyber Workforce and Education Summit. 
Similarly, the Department of State faces its own IT workforce 
challenges. In a GAO report published in April 2022, GAO states that 
``State has not recruited continuously year-round for most of its IT 
positions or regularly assessed its staffing needs.'' Additional 
challenges include ``shortage of talent in pipeline and higher 
attrition rates compared to new hires'' and limited training and career 
development opportunities.'' While the Under Secretary of Management 
normally addresses some of these issues, the Bureau of Cyberspace and 
Digital Policy for evident reasons has a vested interest in a strong, 
viable IT workforce comprised of top tech talent. You touched on this 
in your confirmation hearing when you said that you ``can imagine a 
future where any candidate to be a chief of mission is expected to have 
an understanding of these issues.''

   If confirmed, what will you do to ensure that the Department is 
        recruiting and retaining IT talent as effectively as possible? 
        How do you envision the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital 
        Policy's involvement in this process?

    Answer. The CDP Bureau provides opportunities for all Department 
employees to learn about cyber and digital policy issues. For example, 
CDP provides training courses on International Digital Economy Policy 
and Cyber Diplomacy at the Foreign Service Institute, which are open to 
all direct-hire employees posted in Washington and overseas. If 
confirmed, I will work to expand those opportunities. Equally, I will 
encourage CDP staff to leverage opportunities inside and outside the 
Department to improve their own expertise on information and 
communications technology. I also pledge to work closely with the 
Bureau of Global Talent Management to recruit, retain, train, and 
sustain a diverse, talented, and inclusive workforce. Likewise, I will 
advocate in the U.S. business and technology communities to encourage 
Americans with technology expertise to spend time in public service and 
am eager to support government-wide efforts to make it easier for mid-
career Americans to serve.

    Question. How do you plan to ensure that the Department of State 
has a diverse regional/demographic reach for tech talent?

    Answer. I support the Department of State's commitment to building 
a workforce that reflects our nation's diversity and leverages the 
creativity of diverse, talented groups to advance the United States' 
foreign policy priorities. As I stated in my confirmation hearing, my 
first priority is building the team and culture at the Bureau to enable 
its long-term success. My hope is that the Bureau's workforce will 
increasingly become the hub for international cyberspace and digital 
policy, integrating national security, economic prosperity, and human 
rights. Achieving this aspiration will demand that we recruit and 
retain talent from the entire national talent pool--across geography 
and across demography. If confirmed, I would welcome the opportunity to 
work with the Bureau of Information Resource Management and the Bureau 
of Global Talent Management's Diplomats in Residence--career Foreign 
Service Officers and Specialists located throughout the United States 
who provide guidance and advice on careers, internships, and 
fellowships to students and professionals in the communities they 
serve--to ensure the Department has a diverse workforce.

    Question. Would you commit to coming to universities in New Jersey 
to seek out tech talent for the Department?

    Answer. It is critical the United States has the workforce to 
address the challenges and opportunities in cyberspace and the digital 
economy. Universities around the country, including in New Jersey, play 
an important role. If confirmed, I will work with academic stakeholders 
to encourage relevant coursework that integrates cyber and digital 
policy issues into all facets of our education system, and I would look 
forward to visiting universities in New Jersey and around the country, 
if invited.



                               __________


            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
         Submitted to Nathaniel Fick by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. How can the U.S. re-establish credible deterrence in 
cyberspace?

    Answer. Effectively shaping adversary decision-making requires the 
thoughtful application of all the tools of national power, including 
diplomacy. If confirmed, I look forward to working with Congress and my 
executive branch colleagues to redouble U.S. efforts to achieve a 
significant, long-lasting reduction in destructive, disruptive, or 
otherwise destabilizing malicious cyber activities directed against 
U.S. interests. If confirmed, I will lead U.S. diplomatic efforts to 
build a broad-based, voluntary coalition of likeminded states that can 
organize cooperative responses to significant cyber incidents, together 
ensuring that there are consequences for unacceptable cyber activity 
and in this way, shaping adversaries' decision-making. Within the U.S. 
interagency, if confirmed, I will work to strengthen collaboration 
between the Departments of State and Defense, to include increasing 
cooperation around cyber operations. These efforts will complement and 
be strengthened by CDP's positive agenda, grounded in U.S. values to 
promote the use of digital technologies for the benefit of all people, 
everywhere.

    Answer. What role should the cyber bureau play in these efforts?

    Answer. Effectively shaping adversary decision-making requires the 
thoughtful application of all the tools of national power, including 
diplomacy as well as other capabilities our interagency partners can 
bring to bear. If confirmed, I will collaborate with the interagency 
and lead U.S. diplomatic efforts to build a broad-based, voluntary 
coalition of likeminded states that can organize cooperative responses 
to significant cyber incidents, together ensuring that there are 
appropriate consequences for unacceptable cyber activity and in this 
way, shaping adversaries' decision-making. Such cooperative responses 
build on, and create accountability for adhering to, the international 
consensus around the framework of responsible state behavior in 
cyberspace. If confirmed, I will continue the Department's work to 
promote this framework and support its implementation across the globe.

    Question. Will you commit to working with the committee on this 
issue?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the committee to explore 
development of a streamlined authority to allow sharing of critical 
cyber capabilities and information with key operational partners.

    Question. What efforts will you take to help ensure the CDP bureau 
is capable of attract and retain the nation's foremost digital and 
cyberspace talent?

    Answer. The CDP Bureau must operate like a 21st-century talent 
organization. This means that its success depends not upon a patent or 
process innovation or a market monopoly, but upon a continuous ability 
to recruit and retain a broad team of talented people who have many 
other options for where to spend their professional time and energy. 
The Bureau's great advantage in doing so is the power and importance of 
its mission. We will need to make the case--inside the Department, 
across the interagency, and outside the Government--that technology is 
the next frontier of diplomacy, that these issues are fundamental to 
the future of American power and competitiveness, and that public 
service is a noble and rewarding pursuit. If confirmed, I will 
encourage Department employees to come spend time in the Bureau, will 
commit to supporting members of the CDP Bureau team in gaining as much 
professional training as possible, and will do my utmost to build and 
sustain a culture that empowers them and enables them to succeed. I 
pledge to work closely with the Bureau of Global Talent Management to 
recruit, retain, train, and sustain a diverse, talented, and inclusive 
workforce. Likewise, I will advocate in the U.S. business and 
technology communities to encourage Americans with technology expertise 
to spend time in public service, and I am eager to support government-
wide efforts to make it easier for mid-career Americans to serve.

    Question. What role does multilateral cooperation have in 
countering malign cyber influence (e.g., from the PRC, Russian 
Federation, and DPRK)?

    Answer. The United States' work in international and multilateral 
organizations has led to international consensus on a framework of 
responsible state behavior in cyberspace. All U.N. member states have 
committed to act in accordance with this framework. While such a 
framework is not self-reinforcing, it sets the foundation upon which we 
can rally likeminded partners to hold irresponsible state actors 
accountable, including through public attributions, diplomatic actions, 
and other responses. Likeminded partners have grown increasingly 
willing to take such action in response to malign cyber influence. If 
confirmed, I will continue to press for progress with our partners in 
countering malign cyber influence and promoting a rights-respecting 
cyber and digital policy agenda.

    Question. How will the Department of State integrate the Bureau for 
Cyberspace and Digital Policy with other functional and regional 
bureaus?

    Answer. The Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy brings together 
into a single entity the economic, national security, and human rights 
considerations regarding cyberspace and digital technologies. In doing 
so, the Bureau not only integrates its approach to these issues 
internally and thereby advances Secretary Blinken's modernization 
agenda, but also is well placed to play a coordinating role within the 
Department and across the interagency. If confirmed, I will build an 
organization that elevates cyber and digital issues in U.S. foreign 
policy and maximizes our engagement with regional and functional 
bureaus to strengthen diplomacy as a tool to achieve our national 
objectives on cyber and digital issues.

    Question. Do you anticipate working closely with other U.S. 
Government agencies? If so, which?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work to build an organization that can 
elevate cyber and digital issues within U.S. foreign policy and 
maximize our engagement with interagency partners, including the 
Department of Defense, U.S. Agency for International Development, 
Department of Homeland Security, National Security Council, Office of 
the National Cyber Director, Department of Justice, Federal 
Communications Commission, and Department of Commerce. In leveraging 
the expertise of these departments and agencies, the Bureau can 
strengthen diplomacy as a tool to achieve our national objectives on 
cyber and digital issues.

    Question. Do you work with cyber/digital trafficking?

    Answer. Trafficking is a particularly heinous misuse of the 
Internet. If confirmed, I pledge to redouble our efforts, working with 
the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement and the 
Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, as well as our 
partners at the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation to ensure U.S. diplomacy maintains clear focus on the 
prevention of digital trafficking.

    Question. In what capacity will you engage with the ``deep web?''

    Answer. Recognizing the gravity of cybercrime and the importance 
the United States places on combatting it, if confirmed, I will 
coordinate within the Department and with our partners in law 
enforcement to ensure U.S. diplomacy complements other U.S. Government 
efforts to reduce the threat of international cybercrime wherever it 
occurs, including the ``deep web.''

    Question. How is the department working towards bolstering public/
private partnerships such that innovation in cyberspace is encouraged?

    Answer. The Department of State advances U.S. foreign policy 
priorities through private sector engagement, including by cultivating 
cross-sector partnerships. Successful partnerships of this nature will 
be a necessary element of the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy's 
overall success, given the concentration of talent and technical 
capacity in the U.S. innovation economy. If confirmed, I look forward 
to working to leverage the Department's various mechanisms, tools, and 
networks to strengthen partnerships with the private sector on cyber 
and digital issues. We need to continue to foster an open, enabling 
environment to encourage future innovation aligned with U.S. values.

    Question. ``Upholding democratic values'' is one of CDP's stated 
goals; which specific regions or nations does it have in mind?

    Answer. The U.S. Government works closely with allies and partners 
around the world, including members of the Freedom Online Coalition and 
partners who affirm the Declaration of the Future of the Internet, to 
uphold democratic values globally. The United States works to deter and 
respond to transnational repression and digital authoritarianism by 
promoting digital freedom in accordance with the U.S. values of 
openness and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. If 
confirmed, I will sustain these existing partnerships and seek new 
opportunities to ensure that U.S. cyber and digital diplomacy advances 
democracy and human rights.

    Question. What role do you envision the CDP bureau playing in 
ensuring the United States maintains global leadership in developing 
artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other emergent 
technologies?

    Answer. If confirmed, I envision the CDP Bureau working alongside 
the Office of the Special Envoy for Critical and Emerging Technology to 
continue to lead the Department's engagement in many international 
venues where artificial intelligence policy issues are discussed, such 
as through bilateral dialogues, at the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, Global Partnership on AI, Group of Seven 
(G7), Group of Twenty (G20), U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, 
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, and International Telecommunication 
Union. The United States can both further our technological 
capabilities and promote democratic values and human rights by working 
with our partners and allies to promote the responsible stewardship of 
trustworthy artificial intelligence and machine learning.

    Question. How will CDP collaborate with other agencies and 
departments in their existing research?

    Answer. Research related to artificial intelligence (AI) and 
machine learning, as technologies with cross-cutting implications 
across policy areas, is discussed in many bilateral and multilateral 
settings. If confirmed, my vision is that CDP will continue close 
collaboration with other agencies and departments in their existing 
research by coordinating U.S. participation in those dialogues. In 
addition, CDP works alongside the Office of the Science and Technology 
Advisor and Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and 
Scientific Affairs to co-lead the Department of State's participation 
in the National Science and Technology Council's subcommittee on 
Machine Learning and AI.

    Question. How will CDP maintain an understanding of emergent 
technology, given its rapid pace of development?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work to ensure CDP maintains an 
understanding of emergent technology by doing many of the same things I 
did while leading a cutting-edge technology company: leveraging 
internal expertise within our organization, close collaboration with 
other relevant agencies and departments, and regular consultations with 
industry, academia, and civil society experts. I will work to increase 
our internal expertise through new hires and access to increased 
training opportunities. CDP also has the benefit of the Department's 
network of embassies and consulates to maintain an understanding of 
international developments and other countries' approaches to emergent 
technology.

    Question. Are there any emergent technologies that the CDP sees 
utility or potential in?

    Answer. Yes, CDP sees utility and potential in many emerging 
technologies and their applications, including artificial intelligence 
(AI) and machine learning, Internet of Things, blockchain, Web 3.0, 6G, 
and Open RAN architecture. Advances in emergent technologies present 
great opportunities in addition to great challenges. If confirmed, I 
will work with allies and partners, companies, universities, and civil 
society organizations that promote democratic values and share a 
commitment to design and deploy technology for the benefit of all 
people.

    Question. If confirmed, how would you engage with allies and 
partners to promote Cyber policies consistent with U.S. values?

    Answer. The Department is on the frontlines of the U.S. 
Government's efforts to promote meaningful access to digital 
technologies, maintain an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable 
Internet, and preserve a stable cyberspace by defending against 
challenges such as digital authoritarianism. These efforts are central 
to the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy's mission. Digitally 
repressive regimes and foreign adversaries often seek to harness 
digital technologies to control domestic populations through a 
sprawling system of censorship, surveillance, and Internet 
restrictions. These efforts also extend outward through transnational 
repression of diaspora communities and other critics abroad, and the 
export of authoritarian goals through trade relationships, the U.N. and 
other multilateral fora, and standard-setting bodies. If confirmed, I 
will lead CDP in sustaining and building partnerships to defend against 
these efforts and ensure U.S. diplomacy advances digital technologies 
that support democracy and human rights.

    Question. If confirmed, how would you directly address actions of 
U.S. private or public entities in conflict with U.S. national cyber 
security strategy?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with interagency partners to 
increase alignment between U.S. public and private entities and the 
U.S. national cyber security strategy and policy priorities. U.S. 
companies have a major role in advancing an open, interoperable, 
secure, and reliable Internet and should not be complicit in enabling 
the use of technology in ways that violate human rights and democratic 
values.

    Question. Would you directly address foreign countries restricting 
internet freedoms in violation of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political rights?

    Answer. Yes. The Department of State monitors and responds to laws, 
policies, and activities that restrict human rights online and works to 
address all concerns through appropriate bilateral and multilateral 
channels and public diplomacy. The Department consistently seeks to 
advance Internet freedom through U.N. bodies, the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development, the Group of Seven (G7), and 
other international organizations. The U.S. Government also plays a 
global leadership role in multi-stakeholder initiatives focused on 
Internet freedom and human rights online, such as the Freedom Online 
Coalition (FOC). The FOC has been instrumental in building cross-
regional coalitions to support Internet freedom. The United States will 
take over the chairmanship of the FOC in 2023 as part of our commitment 
to bolstering its work in the Summit for Democracy's Presidential 
Initiative for Democratic Renewal. If confirmed, I will continue to 
carry forward and expand upon this vital work in coordination with the 
Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.

    Question. Please describe your assessment of global internet 
freedom and the U.S. Government's response to a rising authoritarian 
threat off and online.

    Answer. I am concerned by the decline in Internet freedom globally, 
including through the misuse of digital technologies. Preventing the 
misuse of digital technologies, including by authoritarian governments, 
is a core priority for the United States. This topic is being addressed 
bilaterally and in coordination with partners and allies via the Summit 
for Democracy, U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, Freedom Online 
Coalition, and elsewhere. For example, the U.S. Government continues to 
work through the Summit for Democracy to take action, including 
establishing a code of conduct on how export controls can be used to 
address the proliferation of technologies conducive to human rights 
abuses. Additionally, the Department intends to bolster U.S. global 
leadership on Internet freedom issues through our chairmanship of the 
Freedom Online Coalition in 2023. If confirmed, I will continue to 
carry this work forward.

    Question. How can you, if confirmed, best streamline current U.S. 
Government efforts to promote global internet freedom?

    Answer. Promoting Internet freedom is an essential part of the U.S. 
Government's approach to protecting and promoting human rights. The 
Department of State leads the U.S. Government's efforts to promote 
respect for human rights globally, including online, by raising these 
concerns bilaterally, building and participating in multilateral and 
multi-stakeholder coalitions focused on advancing human rights online 
globally, and funding civil society-led policy and advocacy projects 
that promote Internet freedom. If confirmed, I will strengthen 
coordination within the Department and across the interagency to ensure 
the U.S. Government has an integrated, cohesive policy on initiatives 
to promote Internet freedom that guard against the rise of digital 
authoritarianism.

    Question. Will you also plan to push back against proposals from 
allies or tech companies that promote censorship or other restrictions 
on the freedom of speech?

    Answer. Some countries attempt to regulate social media to stifle 
freedom of expression, target activists, or limit access to independent 
journalism. The United States responds to these actions with diplomatic 
engagement that advocates for respecting human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, both online and offline, including in response to content 
issues. The Department encourages Internet service providers, including 
social media platforms, to consider their commitments under the U.N. 
Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights and their own terms of 
service. If confirmed, I will work diligently to address and advance 
digital freedom as a core element of U.S. cyber and digital policy by 
continuing engagement across the full range of governmental and non-
governmental stakeholders.

    Question. What is your assessment of the proposed treaty?

    Answer. The process to consider a new binding international 
instrument on cybercrime poses a number of challenges that could, if 
not squarely addressed, adversely impact the United States and its 
citizens. However, the delegation leading the negotiations has done a 
remarkable job in minimizing Russian and PRC influence, establishing an 
expert-driven process on the basis of consensus where both nations and 
civil society experts can have their views heard. The U.S. Government 
continues to lead efforts to be inclusive and argue for a convention 
that is a narrowly focused on criminal justice, respects human rights, 
and supports multistakeholder engagement. If confirmed, I will continue 
to ensure the United States works towards these objectives.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to working with relevant 
bureaus and agencies to promoting text that promotes American values 
and national security interests in the treaty?

    Answer. Yes. While the current process was initiated by Russia, 
they are not leading this process. Instead, the United States is 
leading a broad and diverse group of experts in debates on the 
technical merits of an international instrument focused on cybercrime. 
The United States and its like-minded allies continue to lead efforts 
to advance a narrowly focused criminal justice instrument that respects 
human rights, supporting multistakeholder engagement. If confirmed, I 
will work to ensure the U.S. Government is successful in this regard.

        Submitted to Nathaniel Fick by Senator Edward J. Markey

    Question. How will your private sector experience enhance your 
effectiveness in strengthening opportunities for public-private 
partnerships to advance U.S. foreign policy goals in the areas of 
cyberspace and digital policy?

    Answer. The United States has long championed the importance of a 
multistakeholder approach to address cyber and digital policy. This is 
essential given the concentration of talent and technical capacity in 
the U.S. innovation economy. Accordingly, successful public-private 
partnerships are a necessary element of CDP's overall success. If 
confirmed, I look forward to identifying opportunities to support both 
new and continued partnerships with the private sector. If confirmed, I 
will explore a range of options including using blended finance 
programs to attract private investment in critical technologies, 
incorporating additional expertise from industry in CDP-funded 
trainings and workshops, and meeting with global technology business 
leaders to explain CDP's priorities.

    Question. Under your leadership, what principles will govern the 
Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy's engagement with civil society 
organizations and participants in other countries who are pushing back 
against digital authoritarianism and advocating for democracy, human 
rights, and fundamental freedoms?

    Answer. Digital transformation presents great promise for 
collaboration, communication, and innovation for billions of people. As 
millions more come online each day to maximize the opportunities for 
their livelihoods, their societal engagements, and their prosperity, 
they also face potential risks of exclusion, harm, and the extension of 
offline inequalities to online disparities. If confirmed, I will ensure 
that the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy's engagement on 
digital freedom is coordinated with key stakeholders within the 
Department, interagency, and international community, including the 
private sector and civil society. I will make sure the bureau's work in 
this space is guided by and consistent with the United States' 
obligations under domestic and international law and U.S. policy and 
commitments, including the principles outlined in the founding 
documents of the Freedom Online Coalition, as well as the Biden-Harris 
administration's trademark initiatives on technology and democracy such 
as the Declaration for the Future of the Internet.

    Question. The Declaration for the Future of the Internet is an 
important step in obtaining the commitment of governments to 
fundamental values including privacy and respect for human rights. What 
actions will you take to increase the number of signatories and 
encourage more governments to commit to the Declaration's vision of an 
open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work closely with likeminded partners 
to promote the principles of the Declaration for the Future of the 
Internet (DFI), encourage additional governments to join, and 
operationalize its commitments in concrete ways. For example, we will 
use joint demarches with appropriate partner governments to persuade 
countries that have not yet joined to do so. We will also promote DFI's 
principles in relevant international forums. I will work to ensure that 
we ourselves operate according to DFI's principles so that we are 
leading by example and reinforcing the norms we are advocating around 
the world.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
           Submitted to Nathaniel Fick by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. Is the Chinese Communist Party a threat to the United 
States?

    Answer. The next ten years may be the decisive decade in the 
competition between the United States and the PRC. As I stated in my 
confirmation hearing, ``Our strategic competition with China along 
digital lines is probably the most defining strategic question of my 
generation. We have a competitor out there with a very different view 
of what our global technology future should look like.'' If confirmed, 
I will help advance the Biden-Harris administration's comprehensive, 
whole-of-government strategy to compete responsibly with the PRC, while 
highlighting with allies and partners our vision for an open, 
interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet as a key enabler of global 
freedom and prosperity.

    Question. Does the Chinese Communist Party undertake any activities 
that are beneficial to U.S. interests?

    Answer. As Secretary Blinken has said, we will cooperate with the 
PRC where our interests align. However, the CCP's authoritarian vision 
for cyberspace, telecommunications, digital governance, and emerging 
technology is not one of these areas. If confirmed, I will focus on 
addressing the risks to the United States, our partners, and our 
allies--and to an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet--
that would come from having the rules of the road set by a country that 
does not share our core values.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China as 
part of your work?

    Answer. The United States will continue to engage with the PRC in 
forums where the PRC and the United States are both members, like APEC 
and the ASEAN Regional Forum. The United States will also continue 
bilateral diplomatic engagement to further its interests in 
multilateral fora. By including all stakeholders in standards-
developing organizations (SDOs), the resulting standards reflect a 
private sector-led, consensus-based, bottom-up approach, that has been 
the key to our efforts to promote a democratic, rules-based system. 
Their inclusion also avoids the creation of a parallel SDO structure in 
which the PRC is able to promote its model to smaller countries 
unopposed. If confirmed, I will pursue bilateral engagement with the 
PRC on topics and in organizations in which we have shared interests.

    Question. Are you aware of the danger posed to these activists by 
the Chinese Communist Party? If so, what can be done to limit this 
activity?

    Answer. I am concerned about the threat posed by the People's 
Republic of China's use of transnational repression. To address this 
threat, the Biden-Harris administration is pursuing a multi-faceted 
strategy. The Department of State has worked to increase awareness of 
resources available to assist targets of transnational repression at 
home and abroad, to encourage open lines of communication between these 
individuals and the U.S. Government, and to impose consequences on PRC 
officials engaged in transnational repression. If confirmed, I will 
strengthen partnerships with the private sector and our allies to 
counter PRC transnational repression through digital means and work to 
reduce the likelihood that U.S. partners facilitate PRC transnational 
repression.

    Question. Many of these activists receive direct support and 
funding from the State Department, or from international organizations 
that receive U.S. Government funding. If confirmed, what will you do to 
ensure that communication with these activists is not vulnerable to CCP 
cyberattacks?

    Answer. Safeguarding the activists, human rights defenders, and 
civil society organizations who receive support and funding from U.S. 
Foreign Assistance requires that their security practices are guided by 
experts who understand the local context and can track changes in those 
threat landscapes. This is true in many sensitive contexts, including 
those at risk from digital threats stemming from the PRC. If confirmed, 
I will support ongoing and future U.S. Government efforts to raise 
awareness of digital risks to individuals at risk of being targeted by 
the PRC and work with others in the Department to provide digital 
safety training, tools, and materials to activists, human rights 
defenders, and civil society organizations at risk of digitally aided 
repression and online attacks. Furthermore, I will ensure digital 
safety-related risk management efforts led by the Department are 
informed by relevant intelligence information and expertise.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to work with social media 
companies, and other countries, to ensure that activists at risk of 
transnational repression are not vulnerable to CCP cyberattacks?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue to maintain close contact 
with social media companies and other digital platforms to raise 
awareness of transnational repression and to combat PRC malicious cyber 
activities, disinformation, and online harassment while emphasizing 
U.S. support for freedom of expression, including online. I will also 
work with other governments to raise awareness of, and address 
vulnerabilities to, cyberattacks and other digital security risks to 
individuals who may be targeted for transnational repression. If 
confirmed, I will work with others in the Department and across the 
interagency to promote accountability for actors who facilitate 
transnational repression using the tools the Department has available, 
including sanctions, export controls, and visa restrictions.

    Question. In your opinion, are American citizens' communications 
with embassies and consulates overseas protected from surveillance by 
the Chinese Communist Party, the Russian Federation, Iran, North Korea, 
the Maduro Regime, or Cuba? Please explain.

    Answer. The Department of State uses its resources to monitor all 
its embassies and consulates for unauthorized surveillance, including 
surveillance of communications between Department officials and 
American citizens. In the event that surveillance is detected on 
Department infrastructure from an unauthorized actor, Department 
officials work with federal law enforcement and intelligence partners 
to mitigate the effects of the intrusion. The Department uses 
information from these incidents to improve its monitoring regime and 
better secure its communications and IT infrastructure. If confirmed, I 
will work with the Department colleagues charged with the protection of 
embassy and consulate communications to align, where needed, any 
resource requests and related foreign policy concerns.

    Question. In your opinion, are formal communications (i.e. visa 
applications, other consular services) between third-country nationals 
and our embassy and consulates' Consular Affairs sections adequately 
protected from authoritarian regimes?

    Answer. Cybersecurity is one of the Department's top priorities. 
The Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA) manages a robust cybersecurity 
program closely linked to Department and other interagency efforts. CA 
dedicates substantial resources and highly skilled personnel to 
continuously monitor, test, and implement upgrades to Department 
systems to improve the U.S. defense against evolving cybersecurity 
threats. The Department's network users--both domestic and overseas--
undergo annual training to recognize common scenarios and 
vulnerabilities, such as spear phishing, so they can help defend these 
critical systems. If confirmed, I will work closely with colleagues in 
CA to ensure that our efforts are integrated and well-supported.

    Question. What more can be done in this regard?

    Answer. The Bureau of Consular Affairs collaborates across its 
directorates and offices, and with other bureaus within the Department, 
to strengthen the Department's ability to proactively identify and 
mitigate potential threats to critical systems and networks before they 
can be exploited. Additionally, Consular Affairs is actively expanding 
its partnership with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
Agency and other U.S. interagency partners to increase its security 
posture. At the individual level, Consular Affairs promotes awareness 
and a shared sense of responsibility through scenario training, 
debriefs and workshops, and targeted security awareness briefings to 
government and contract staff such as developers, site administrators, 
and application administrators in order to protect the privacy and 
integrity of the information entrusted to us by the traveling public. 
If confirmed, I will work closely with Consular Affairs colleagues to 
support those efforts to prioritize the awareness and security of U.S. 
citizens abroad.

    Question. In your opinion, are American travelers adequately 
informed of the data security risks when they travel to these 
countries, or places in which these authoritarian regimes have a major 
presence?

    Answer. U.S. citizens are warned of security risks, including 
threats to their data and the threat of surveillance and monitoring, 
through the Department's International Travel--Country Information 
Pages on travel.state.gov. In addition, U.S. Embassies may notify U.S. 
citizens of these threats through alerts and messages as appropriate. 
U.S. citizens are encouraged to enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment 
Program (STEP) before traveling abroad so that they receive direct 
communication on safety conditions and other important information for 
their destination. The Department also amplifies these messages on 
social media in order to reach a wide audience. If confirmed, I will 
work closely with colleagues throughout the Department to ensure our 
policy and technical approaches are well-aligned so American travelers 
can understand the importance of this issue.

    Question. Should Americans have TikTok, or other apps operated by 
companies with close ties to the Chinese Communist Party, on their 
phones? Do these apps pose a risk? Please explain.

    Answer. I believe that apps from developers with close ties to the 
CCP do pose a privacy risk to their users. Personally, I do not use 
them, and I do my best to prevent my children from using them. The 
Biden-Harris administration is committed to protecting Americans' 
sensitive personal data in line with advancing our overall national 
security interests, as well as promoting longstanding foreign policy 
objectives such as the free flow of data with trust over an open, 
interoperable, secure, and reliable Internet. The Bureau of Cyberspace 
and Digital Policy leads the Department of State's coordination on 
multiple lines of effort to strengthen the protection of American 
users' data, including data shared through phone applications, 
particularly through the implementation of E.O. 14034 (``Protecting 
Americans' Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries'') and E.O. 13873 
(``Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services 
Supply Chain''). If confirmed, I will ensure the CDP Bureau works both 
internally and with the interagency, as well as with like-minded allies 
and partners, to carry out these efforts fully.

    Question. Does the State Department keep a list of apps vulnerable 
to authoritarian surveillance, and if so, does it make American 
travelers aware of these apps?

    Answer. The State Department is involved in several interagency 
processes to identify risks to U.S. national security, including 
authoritarian surveillance of U.S. users through social media 
applications, through implementation of E.O. 14034 (``Protecting 
Americans' Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries'') and E.O. 13873 
(``Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services 
Supply Chain''), led by the Department of Commerce. If confirmed, I 
will work closely with colleagues in the Department and across the 
interagency to help ensure Americans are aware of the risks posed by 
the use of certain digital technologies, including apps.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to improve State 
Department policies to protect American travelers from authoritarian 
surveillance and cyber-attacks?

    Answer. The Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy is committed to 
strengthening the Department of State's policies and programming to 
address national security challenges in cyberspace to protect U.S. 
citizens here and abroad. If confirmed, I commit to working with others 
in the Department, the interagency, and the international community to 
continue to strengthen the U.S. culture of cybersecurity for the 
benefit of all users, including by promoting awareness of cyber 
hygiene.

                              ----------                              


                       TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 2022

                                       U.S. Senate,
                            Committee on Foreign Relations,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:47 p.m., in 
Room 419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Jeanne Shaheen, 
presiding.
    Present: Senators Shaheen [presiding], Menendez, Murphy, 
Kaine, Markey, Van Hollen, Portman, Young, Barrasso, Cruz, and 
Hagerty.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JEANNE SHAHEEN,
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE

    Senator Shaheen. At this time, I would like to call the 
hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations committee to order. 
Today, we are going to review the nominations of ten important 
best ambassadorial nominees to advance American's foreign 
policy.
    We start with the first five who are before us. In our 
first panel, we will hear from Ms. Kathleen Kavalec to Romania, 
Mr. Ken Merten to Bulgaria, Mr. Christopher Robinson to Latvia, 
Mr. Bijan Sabet to the Czech Republic, and Mr. George Kent to 
Estonia.
    Today, diplomats are more critical than ever in advancing 
U.S. foreign policy and National Security interests at this--
the global security landscape is experiencing probably the most 
seismic shift since World War II.
    I recently returned from the Halifax International Security 
Forum in Canada right before Thanksgiving, and together with 
Senator Risch, the Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign 
Relations committee, we led the largest delegation to date, 
nine members of Congress, bipartisan, bicameral to that forum.
    And in each of the interactions that we had with foreign 
government officials, we felt the United States commitment to 
providing continued support to Ukraine was mirrored and shared 
by our allies. And furthermore, that our allies very much 
appreciated the strong stand taken by the United States and the 
importance of our foreign policy.
    And while our diplomatic impact is forged and sustained by 
the dedicated public servants of the Foreign Service, we must 
have qualified, confirmed ambassadors on the ground to lead and 
support them.
    To tackle the myriad complex challenges we are facing, we 
have to have ambassadors heading our embassies and representing 
us in multilateral organizations. I want to take this moment to 
recognize my ranking member for today's hearing, Senator 
Portman of Ohio, because this will be our last time chairing a 
hearing together.
    Senator Portman, we have worked together on a whole range 
of issues on this committee from the--and beyond, from the 
historic infrastructure deal to bipartisan support for Ukraine. 
And I am really grateful for your partnership and for the 
leadership that you have shown in helping to lead the 
Congressional support for Ukraine.
    We have the opportunity to travel there on several 
occasions together and it is very clear that your commitment to 
what is happening there is not going to end when you leave the 
Senate, so thank you for that. Let me introduce the nominees on 
our first of these two panels. I am pleased that Kathleen Ann 
Kavalec has been nominated to serve as U.S. Ambassador to 
Romania.
    This would be something of a homecoming, as I understand 
you served at Embassy Bucharest earlier in your career. You are 
a career member of the Senior Foreign Service with the rank of 
Minister Counselor. And since 2019, you have served as the 
OSCE's Head of Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
    She is an expert in the region, having served as Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of State in the Bureau of European and 
Eurasian Affairs, led the State Department's Office of Russian 
Affairs, and served at our Embassy in Kyiv and twice in the 
U.S. Embassy Moscow.
    Romania has been a longstanding leader in NATO with respect 
to the Black Sea region. This is a vital transportation area 
that must be protected as the economies and people of many 
nations depend on the safe, unimpeded passage of goods, grains, 
and supplies across its waters
     I am going to stop in my introductions and see if I can 
ask Senator Markey, if you would like to do the introduction of 
Mr. Sabet. Go ahead, Senator Markey.
    Senator Markey. Thank you, Madam Chair and Ranking Member 
Portman. I am pleased to introduce an accomplished and 
acclaimed son of Massachusetts, Bijan Sabet, President Biden's 
nominee to be the United States Ambassador to the Czech 
Republic.
    He is joined here today by his wife, Lauren, and his 
children, Sophia, Ali, and James are watching from home. Mr. 
Sabet story is in many ways the embodiment of the American 
dream. Although he grew up in New York to immigrant parents, he 
had the good sense to move to Boston, where he attended my alma 
mater, Boston College.
    Unfortunately, however, while he had the good sense to fly 
high with the B.C. Eagles, he has failed to have the good sense 
to abandon the Yankees. But we forgive him for that one lapse 
of judgment----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Shaheen. You may forgive him----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Markey. He got his professional start in the 
somewhat warmer Silicon Valley. Luckily, his wife eventually 
convinced him to move back to Massachusetts.
    Mr. Sabet continues to affirm his commitment to our beloved 
brain State, serving on the Board of Trustees of Boston 
College, as well as on the board of trustees of both the Beaver 
Country Day School and the Saint Mark School in Southborough.
    Mr. Sabet has built an impressive career with 
accomplishments too numerous to list in their entirety, but 
including helping to build up numerous companies, including 
quite a few headquartered in Massachusetts like Wayfair.
    Mr. Sabet has never forgotten the private sector's 
responsibility to its workers and their communities. He has 
been an advocate for CEOs in the tech world to stand up for 
their values and their employees. Recently, he has been focused 
on supporting climate focused startups, working on several 
issues close to my heart.
    Always hungry for new challenges, Mr. Sabet has turned his 
considerable talents to public service. This nomination comes 
at an important time for the region. The United States and 
Czech Republic have a deep and abiding relationship.
    We are NATO's allies, economic partners, and historic 
friends in the 20th century. Prague was on the front lines of 
the last hot war in Europe and the epicenter of the ensuing 
cold one.
    And today, as Europe confronts its biggest security 
challenges in decades, Prague is once again at the center of 
the storm. I commend Mr. Sabet for rising to meet this moment. 
Mr. Sabet, we congratulate you on your nomination.
    Massachusetts thanks you for your service, and we thank you 
for appearing before the committee today. You are going to be 
an outstanding Ambassador. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you very much, Senator Markey. We 
know your schedule may require that you leave, so feel free to 
do that at your leisure.
    Next, we have Mr. Ken Merten. He is nominated to represent 
us in Bulgaria, a reliable ally in an area of strategic 
importance to the United States, where a fragile coalition 
government must tackle corruption and organized crime, while 
also facing an economic downturn exacerbated by Russia's war.
    To its enormous credit, Bulgaria has stood with Ukraine 
despite historically close ties to Russia. This would be 
Ambassador Merten's third tour as Chief of Mission, following 
successful assignments in Croatia and Haiti.
    As ambassador in Haiti, he led the U.S. Government response 
to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, which involved over 22,000 U.S. 
military and thousands of civilian personnel in Haiti from 
numerous U.S. Government agencies.
    He received the 2011 Ryan C. Crocker Award for Outstanding 
Leadership in Expeditionary Diplomacy, which recognizes U.S. 
diplomats who excel in the most challenging leadership 
positions overseas. I am also pleased to see Christopher 
Robinson nominated to the position of Ambassador to Latvia.
    Mr. Robinson is a career member of the Senior Foreign 
Service and currently serves as Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
State for Europe and Eurasia. His nomination comes at an 
important time for our continued collaboration with Latvia on 
resisting Russia's maligned influence in Europe.
    Mr. Robinson has served as the Senior Political Officer at 
our Embassy in Moscow, Deputy Director for Russian Affairs at 
the State Department, and Political Counselor at the U.S. 
Mission to the OSCE, earning multiple State Department awards 
reserved for the finest among our diplomatic corps.
    Finally, I want to welcome Mr. George Kent, nominated to be 
U.S. ambassador to Estonia. Mr. Kent has a distinguished record 
of service with the Department of State in Ukraine, Poland, 
Uzbekistan, Thailand, and Washington, and most recently oversaw 
policy toward Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, and 
Azerbaijan as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Europe. 
He previously led U.S. anti-corruption efforts across Europe 
and Eurasia.
    I appreciate that Estonia has been a valuable NATO partner 
and ally to Ukraine, contributing more military aid per capita 
than any other country, and hosting 60,000 Ukrainian refugees, 
a figure more than 4 percent of Estonia's population.
    Without further ado, I want to hand it over to the Ranking 
Member for his opening remarks, and then we will turn to our 
nominees for their opening statements. Senator Portman.

               STATEMENT OF SENATOR ROBB PORTMAN,
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM OHIO

    Senator Portman. Great. Thank you very much, Senator 
Shaheen, my friend and my partner in so many legislative 
initiatives. I am going to miss partnering with you here in the 
United States Senate, but I look forward to continuing to stay 
in touch.
    And to my colleagues who are with us here, who are already 
in public service, 7 of the 10 of you on these two panels 
already serve our country as career members of our Foreign 
Service. Thank you for your service.
    And for all of you, thank you for stepping up to take on 
additional responsibilities. It is an impressive panel, and 
several of you, I have had the opportunity to work with, or to 
talk to at least, over the years.
    Our first panel, we have Assistant Secretary Chris 
Robinson, who was just discussed. He is heading to Latvia, 
should he be successfully confirmed. And he is no stranger to 
working on these issues, including most recently being in 
Moscow, which I think is good training for this task.
    Unfortunately, our great ally, Latvia, is feeling more and 
more cyber and other threats from Russia. And so I think that 
background will be very helpful, that Mr. Robinson brings to 
the table. I also see we have George Kent with us, Deputy 
Secretary for Estonia.
    I finally remember, Mr. Kent, a meeting with you back in 
2018, I think it was in the spring of 2018, and when you helped 
me to be able to get transportation out to the line of contact 
at the time.
    November 2014 was when the Russians first invaded. And 
2018, there was a hot war going on in the Donbass, and I was 
able to go and see it firsthand, partly due to your 
interventions. I appreciate that. And I want to hear what we 
are going to do to try to help Estonia even more to push back 
on again the threats that they are facing, including cyber 
threats.
    By the way, the place where I was able to go was in the 
East near Bakhmut. And seeing the recent photographs of Bakhmut 
are heartbreaking. That part of the country has been utterly 
destroyed by Russia's brutal assaults, and the Wagner Group in 
particular, mercenaries. So anyway, I look forward to seeing 
how we can deepen our ties with Estonia.
    Next up, Ken Merten is here, a nominee for Bulgaria, a 
strong ally of the United States. I have worked with Mr. Merten 
before because when he was at the Bureau of Western Hemisphere 
Affairs, he helped on a very sensitive issue with regard to 
Haiti.
    And I told you this, but I appreciate your personal 
involvement with my constituents, and eventually a successful 
outcome. But I am curious to know how you will strengthen our 
partnership with Bulgaria and fight Russia's efforts to exert 
malign influence over that country as well. It is an important 
role right now.
    Ms. Kathleen Kavalec is here, who is a nominee for Romania. 
I was in Romania last year and they have done yeoman's work to 
try to help with regard to Ukraine. They are suffering, too, as 
you know, with the electrical issues, with Russian bombing the 
infrastructures in Ukraine. They are affected directly.
    I am glad to have the opportunity to see you before the 
committee and I appreciate it talking to you in advance. Glad 
you are finally here. And then finally last up, Mr. Bijan 
Sabet, who was just talked about, the Ambassador to the Czech 
Republic, the only non-career nominee on this panel.
    I am curious to know how your private sector experience 
will serve you well in this important role with the Czech 
Republic, again, at a critical time, our relationship with 
Prague.
    Again, thank you so much. I will now turn it back to my 
friend and colleague, Senator Shaheen.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you very much, Senator Portman. I 
would ask that we begin at this end with Christopher Robinson, 
and we will go down the table and each of you give your opening 
statements. Please begin.

  STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER T. ROBINSON OF MARYLAND, A CAREER 
    MEMBER OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-
    COUNSELOR, NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND 
PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC 
                           OF LATVIA

    Mr. Robinson. Chairwoman Shaheen, Ranking Member Portman, 
and distinguished members of this committee, it is a privilege 
to appear before you. I am honored to be the nominee for U.S. 
Ambassador to the Republic of Latvia.
    And I thank President Biden and Secretary Blinken for their 
confidence in me. I want to start by recognizing those who have 
made it possible for me to be here today.
    First, I want to honor my wife, Donka, who is here with me 
today. For her love, her commitment, and her support for over 
27 years of marriage. I would not be here without her. We are 
blessed by our three daughters, Faith, Hope, and Charity. 
Charity also joins me here today. I want to thank them for 
their love and the sacrifices they have made growing up with 
the frequent moves and the demands of life in the Foreign 
Service.
    I would also like to thank my mother, Eileen Robinson, and 
my father in law, Peter Todorov, my sister, Gillian, and 
brother, Matthew, as well as my brother and sister in law, Ned 
and Neda Todorov, for their inspiration and steadfast support 
every step of the way.
    I am a career Foreign Service Officer with over 27 years of 
experience. I have served in Russia, Belarus, Nicaragua, and 
Iraq, among many other assignments. Much of my career has 
focused on supporting the freedom and independence of Europe, 
as well as defending human rights, often in some of the world's 
most authoritarian regimes.
    As the events unfolding in Ukraine today demonstrate, 
protecting and supporting these freedoms is fundamental to 
safeguarding our own National Security. Most recently, as 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Russia, I have had the 
privilege to work with this committee to help implement 
policies to counter and deter Russian aggression.
    I thank the committee for the strong bipartisan support it 
has given to these efforts. If confirmed, my first priority 
would be to ensure the safety and security of U.S. citizens in 
the Republic of Latvia. My second priority will be to enhance 
bilateral efforts to counter and deter Russia's aggression, 
particularly against Latvia, and regional efforts to strengthen 
transatlantic security.
    At the core of our relationship with Latvia is our bond as 
NATO's allies. Latvian soldiers have served side by side with 
U.S. soldiers in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Balkans, 
contributing to NATO missions and operations. Latvia hosts one 
of NATO's battlegroups, and our service members train alongside 
Latvians to defend NATO territory.
    Latvia was among the first countries to send weapons to 
Ukraine and continues to support the Government and people of 
Ukraine as they fight for their freedom and democracy. Tens of 
thousands of Ukrainian refugees are currently living in Latvia, 
supported by the Latvian Government.
    If confirmed, I will work with the Latvian Government to 
strengthen our security partnership and our alliance through 
NATO. My third priority will be to collaborate with Latvia to 
address global challenges. Our partnership with Latvia is deep 
and productive and extends far beyond the security realm.
    As an EU member state, Latvia has a critical voice in 
Brussels on regulations and the single market, sanctions, and 
energy policy. Latvia shares U.S. concerns about China's human 
rights record, its strategic alignment with Russia, and its 
record of economic coercion. If confirmed, I will work with 
Latvia to strengthen international protections for human rights 
and the rules based order.
    As host of the NATO's Strategic Communication Center of 
Excellence, Latvia has worked with other countries in the 
region to counter disinformation from Russia and other malign 
actors. If confirmed, I hope to build on and deepen our 
bilateral cooperation to confront this growing challenge.
    Latvia has also committed to ending its dependance on 
Russian natural gas and is working with the U.S. Government to 
identify diversified energy options, including liquefied 
natural gas and advanced nuclear technologies.
    If confirmed, I will work with Latvia to end its dependance 
on Russian energy. Finally, if confirmed, I look forward to 
working with the talented team at Embassy Riga to build on 
their successes and advance these shared goals together.
    I will continue to partner with Congress to further U.S. 
priorities in Latvia, and I enthusiastically await hearing from 
people across Latvia, sharing our ideas and deepening people to 
people ties as we strive towards a better tomorrow.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I look 
forward to your questions.

    I want to start by recognizing those who have made it possible for 
me to be here today. First, I want to honor my wife, Donka, for her

    Latvia hosts a large segment of the Russian independent media-in-
exile and has supported Russian journalists' efforts to connect with 
Russian audiences and share the truth of Putin's brutality. If 
confirmed I will support these journalists as they continue doing their 
important work.
    Latvia has also committed to ending its dependence on Russian 
natural gas and is working with the U.S. Government to identify 
diversified energy options, including liquified natural gas and 
advanced nuclear technologies. If confirmed, I will work with Latvia to

 STATEMENT OF GEORGE P. KENT OF MASSACHUSETTS, A CAREER MEMBER 
  OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-COUNSELOR, 
NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF 
    THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

    Mr. Kent. Chairwoman Shaheen, Ranking Member Portman, 
distinguished members of the committee, thank you for holding 
this hearing today.
    It is an honor and a privilege to appear before you as the 
President's nominee to be the Ambassador to the Republic of 
Estonia. I would like to thank President Biden and Secretary 
Blinken for their confidence in me.
    If confirmed, I look forward to working with you, your 
staff, and your colleagues in Congress to ensure the security 
and welfare of U.S. citizens in Estonia and the hardworking 
Americans and Estonians at our Mission.
    I will also work with you to advance regional security and 
NATO cooperation at a time of Russia's war in Ukraine, deepen 
our bilateral trade and entrepreneurship ties, particularly in 
the digital economy in which Estonia excels, and combat hybrid 
threats and transnational crime, with a particular focus on 
cyber.
    Madam Chair, with your permission, I would also like to 
acknowledge and introduce two family members who are here with 
me today. I deeply grateful to my wife, Velida, for moving 
across three continents with me over the past 27 years, and our 
son Georgiy, who along with his two sisters, embraced our 
peripatetic life and constant changes in schools and friends.
    It has been my honor to serve our Nation for 30 years in 
Central Asia, and Central and Eastern Europe, and Southeast 
Asia, and now as the President's nominee to be Ambassador to 
Estonia.
    The pursuit of a Europe whole, free, and at peace has been 
the generational goal of our diplomacy during my entire career. 
This year, the United States and Estonia celebrate 100 years of 
diplomatic bilateral relations.
    Estonia exemplifies what it means to be a committed member 
of NATO. It consistently invests in armed forces with over 2 
percent of GDP, aiming to gain 3 percent by 2024, deploys 
globally on security and peace missions, even as it shores up 
its own borders to deter Russia, which it considers an 
existential threat.
    If confirmed, I will work to ensure Estonia continues to 
strengthen its capabilities and ability to contribute to its 
own defense, and to operate jointly with the United States and 
other NATO allies.
    This will strengthen European and transatlantic deterrence 
and defense, improve the credibility of our collective security 
architecture, and dissuade the increasingly assertive and 
dangerous activities by Russia and other adversaries.
    As you earlier mentioned, Madam Chair, Estonia has been a 
leader in the region's response to Russia's unjust war in 
Ukraine. Estonia is the largest contributor per capita of 
assistance to Ukraine, contributing more than $250 million in 
military aid and $25 million in economic and humanitarian 
assistance this year, as well as hosting almost 60,000 
Ukrainian refugees, nearly 5 percent of its resident 
population.
    2022 also marks the 82nd anniversary of the 1940 Wells 
Declaration, under which the United States refused to recognize 
the forced annexation of Estonia, as well as Latvia and 
Lithuania, into the Soviet Union.
    Estonia showed great strength and determination in 
overcoming Soviet occupation, restoring its independence in 
1991, and making extraordinary progress to become a member of 
NATO and the European Union in 2004. Estonia has emerged as an 
exemplar of prosperity and transparent governance to the region 
and the world.
    If confirmed, I am committed to working with Estonia to 
promote our common goals of democratic values, human rights, 
and the rules based international order around the world.
    The U.S. is also working with Estonia to deepen our trade 
and investment ties, to build back better from the global 
pandemic, to set the rules of the road for the 21st century 
economy, including reliable supply chains, to strengthen energy 
security and the transition to a green economy, and stand 
united against non-market and coercive economic practices.
    Estonia also is a world leader in digital services and 
cybersecurity. Estonia hosts the NATO's Cooperative Cyber 
Defense Center of Excellence, which the U.S. joined in 2011. In 
fact, the annual NATO's Cyber Exercise started in Tallinn 
today.
    The United States and Estonia share a vision of a secure 
and open cyberspace in which all countries behave responsibly. 
If confirmed, I look forward to broadening our strong 
cooperation on cyber issues.
    In sum, the relationship between the U.S. and Estonia is as 
strong and important now it has ever been. If confirmed, I look 
forward to representing our country, and advancing U.S. 
interests and deepening our cooperation with Estonia to 
confront regional and global challenges, and to promote 
transatlantic priorities worldwide.
    Madam Chair, Ranking Member, other members of the 
committee, I am grateful for the opportunity to have addressed 
you today, and I will be at your disposal to answer any 
questions you may have. Thank you.

security, economic, and social values. Our relationship with Estonia is 
as important now as it has ever been. If confirmed by the Senate, I 
look forward to representing my country in advancing U.S. interests and 
in deepening our long-standing and critical cooperation with Estonia as 
we work together to strengthen our already productive relationship in 
confronting regional and global challenges and promoting transatlantic 
priorities worldwide.
    I am grateful for the opportunity to have addressed you today and 
am at your disposal to answer any questions you may have. Thank you.


    Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Kent.
    Mr. Merten.

 STATEMENT OF HON. KENNETH MERTEN OF VIRGINIA, A CAREER MEMBER 
   OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF CAREER MINISTER, 
NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF 
    THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA

    Mr. Merten. Thank you, Chairwoman Shaheen, Ranking Member 
Portman, and distinguished members of the committee. I am 
honored and humbled to be here, to appear before you today as 
President Biden's nominee for U.S. Ambassador to Bulgaria. 
Thank you for your consideration of my nomination.
    Should I be lucky enough to be confirmed, I commit to 
working very closely with you and your staffs. I would like to 
take a moment to acknowledge my wife, Susan, who is here today, 
and our daughters, Elizabeth and Carol.
    We are a Foreign Service family. Susan has accompanied me 
throughout my career, including three tours in Haiti. My 
daughter Carol is not here today but is a first tour Foreign 
Service officer in Matamoros, Mexico. My family and I have had 
the honor of representing the United States overseas for 20 of 
my 35 years in the Foreign Service.
    I have been fortunate enough to have served six of those 
years as Chief of Mission in two very different countries. If 
confirmed, I believe I would bring relevant and broad based 
experience to our Mission in Bulgaria.
    My time as U.S. Ambassador to Haiti, in which I confronted 
the worst urban natural disaster in modern history, a cholera 
epidemic and a hurricane, gave me numerous opportunities to 
demonstrate a full range of management, political, and public 
diplomacy skills. I led an Embassy that ensured an effective 
transition from a 22,000 person military mission to a smaller, 
civilian-led humanitarian mission.
    In Croatia, my team and I accompanied the Government 
through the final stages to EU membership. I successfully 
advocated at every level of the Croatian Government for the 
return of pre-war Jewish property to the Croatian Jewish 
community, resulting in the first repatriation of Jewish 
property since Croatian independence.
    My efforts also laid the foundation for Croatia to 
construct a liquefied natural gas terminal, thus making Croatia 
more energy independent, a particularly important consideration 
these days. If confirmed, these experiences would inform my 
sense of U.S. priorities in Bulgaria.
    First and foremost, the well-being of U.S. citizens and 
Embassy colleagues will be my most important and sacred 
responsibility. Since joining NATO in 2004, Bulgaria has 
consistently demonstrated its commitment to the alliance. It 
contributed forces and sustained casualties in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.
    Russia's war against Ukraine makes our coordination with 
Bulgaria all the more urgent. Bulgaria is today hosting a 
multinational NATO battle group that includes U.S. troops. It 
has registered more than 145,000 refugees from Ukraine for 
temporary protection, fully supported sanctions against Russia, 
and in November, Bulgaria's parliament voted overwhelmingly in 
support of military assistance to Ukraine.
    Bulgaria's acquisition of a second tranche of F-16s will 
mark a significant step towards meeting NATO's defense spending 
commitments. If confirmed, I will continue to grow our 
Mission's engagement and security issues, and support 
Bulgaria's efforts to combat Russia's malign influence.
    Bulgaria has taken positive steps towards energy 
diversification, particularly since Russia cut off natural gas 
supplies in April. The completion of the interconnector Greece-
Bulgaria, which facilitates natural gas imports from 
Azerbaijan, was a major achievement in this regard.
    We will continue to work together in this area, should I be 
fortunate enough to be confirmed. If confirmed, I will work 
tirelessly to build on the outstanding work of my predecessors, 
to strengthen the bilateral relationship with the Republic of 
Bulgaria and advocate for the priorities of the United States.
    Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look 
forward to answer your questions.[The prepared statement of Mr. 
Merten follows:]


               Prepared Statement of Hon. Kenneth Merten

    Thank you, Chairwoman Shaheen, Ranking Member Portman, and

Ambassador to the Republic of Bulgaria. Thank you for your

Foreign Service. I've been fortunate enough to have served six of those

our Mission in Bulgaria.
    My time as U.S. Ambassador to Haiti--in which I confronted the 
worst urban natural disaster in modern history, a cholera epidemic, and 
a hurricane--gave me numerous opportunities to demonstrate a full range 
of management, political, and public diplomacy skills. I led an Embassy 
that increased in size by 20 percent; managed a whole-of-government 
approach as Mission Haiti began to spend $1.2 billion dollars in 
reconstruction assistance; and ensured an effective transition from a 
22,000-person military mission to a smaller civilian-led humanitarian 
mission.
    In Croatia, my team and I accompanied the Government through the 
final stages to EU membership. I successfully advocated at every level 
of the Croatian Government--including with heads of state--for the 
return of pre-war Jewish property to the Croatian Jewish community, 
resulting in the first restitution of Jewish property since Croatian 
independence. My efforts also laid the foundation for Croatia to 
construct a liquefied natural gas terminal, thus making Croatia more 
energy independent, a particularly important consideration these days.
    If confirmed, these experiences would inform my sense of U.S. 
priorities in Bulgaria. First and foremost, the safety and well-being 
of U.S. citizens living, working, and traveling in Bulgaria, as well as 
that of the Embassy team in Sofia, will be my most important and sacred 
responsibility.
    Bulgaria is a strategic partner and Ally of the United States. 
Since joining NATO in 2004, Bulgaria has consistently demonstrated its 
commitment to the Alliance. It contributed forces and sustained 
casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan.
    Russia's unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine makes our 
continued close coordination with Bulgaria all the more urgent, 
particularly given the country's position along Europe's Eastern Flank. 
Bulgaria is hosting a multinational NATO battlegroup that includes U.S. 
troops. It has registered more than 145,000 refugees from Ukraine for 
temporary protection, fully supported sanctions against Russia, and in 
November Bulgaria's parliament voted overwhelmingly in support of 
military assistance to Ukraine. Bulgaria's acquisition of a second 
tranche of F-16s will mark a significant step toward meeting its NATO 
defense spending commitments. If confirmed, I will continue to grow our 
Mission's engagement in security issues and support Bulgaria's efforts 
to combat Russia's malign influence.
    If confirmed, I will also prioritize the expansion and 
diversification of our economic ties with Bulgaria while serving as a 
tireless advocate for stronger rule of law and for the fair treatment 
of U.S. firms. There is tremendous potential to boost our relations and 
expand U.S. commercial interests in key areas like technology and 
innovation, agriculture, education and entrepreneurship, 
infrastructure, and notably, energy.
    Bulgaria has taken positive steps toward energy diversification, 
particularly since Russia cut off natural gas supplies in April after 
the Bulgarian Government refused to pay Gazprom in rubles. The 
completion of the Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria, which facilitates 
natural gas imports from Azerbaijan, was a major achievement in this 
regard. More remains to be done, from securing further LNG supplies to 
procuring nuclear fuel that does not rely upon Russian inputs. If 
confirmed, I am committed to supporting Bulgaria's efforts to 
strengthen energy security, including with the help of U.S. companies' 
technology and know-how.
    If confirmed, I commit myself to earnestly serving as a Chief of 
Mission who leads, manages, and safeguards all our Embassy colleagues. 
I will work tirelessly to build on the outstanding work of my 
predecessors to strengthen our bilateral relationship with the Republic 
of Bulgaria and advocate for the priorities of the United States.
    Thank you for your time and your consideration. I look forward to 
answering your questions.


    Senator Shaheen. Thank you very much. Ms. Kavalec.

   STATEMENT OF KATHLEEN ANN KAVALEC OF CALIFORNIA, A CAREER 
    MEMBER OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-
    COUNSELOR, NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND 
   PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO ROMANIA

    Ms. Kavalec. Thank you, Chairwoman Shaheen, Ranking Member 
Portman, and distinguished members of this committee. I am 
honored to appear before you today as President Biden's nominee 
for U.S. Ambassador to Romania.
    As we speak, Secretary Blinken is in Bucharest, which 
underscores the importance of our long standing partnership in 
Romania. Thank you for your consideration today of my 
nomination. Allow me first to introduce my husband, Mark 
Taplin, a retired Foreign Service Officer, and as well as our 
three children, Ben, Sam and Gwen, who are listening remotely 
today.
    I wish to thank them from the bottom of my heart for all 
the great support they have given me in my career as we have 
traveled around the world together. I had the pleasure of 
serving in Romania once before, as you mentioned, as Cultural 
Affairs Officer at U.S. Embassy Bucharest.
    In that role, I traveled throughout the country to carry 
out our public diplomacy programs and expand our people to 
people ties. I gained an appreciation for cultural exchange 
from my late father, Dan Kavalec, a Spanish instructor, a 
Fulbright grantee, and proponent of good listening skills which 
are so critical to effective diplomacy.
    In my diplomatic career, I focused on building coalitions, 
nurturing relationships, and listening. If confirmed, I look 
forward to applying these and other core diplomatic principles 
to America's vital relationship with Romania.
    To that end, please allow me to outline my policy 
priorities that will guide my work as U.S. Ambassador to 
Romania, if confirmed. First, I will commit myself foremost to 
the safety and security of our Mission team and of U.S. 
citizens living, working, and traveling in Romania.
    Second, if confirmed, I will advance our cooperation with 
Romania and vital security matters. Since the end of the 
communist dictatorship in 1989, Romania has made remarkable 
progress in building a genuine democracy and a market economy.
    Romania made it clear early on that its goal was to join 
NATO and the European Union, and through hard work and 
determination, the country and its people succeeded. I was on 
hand in 2008 when Romania hosted the Bucharest NATO's summit, a 
source of pride for the entire country.
    My family and I joined the celebrations in Sibiu on New 
Year's Day 2007, led by the then mayor, now President Klaus 
Iohannis, that greeted Romania's official accession to the EU. 
Today, Romania is a model for other NATO members. It has 
budgeted 2 percent of its GDP for defense, and most recently 
committed to raising its defense budget to 2.5 percent, much of 
it allocated to purchase U.S. equipment in its robust 
modernization effort.
    It hosts multinational NATO forces and is a longstanding 
contributor to NATO missions and operations worldwide. If 
confirmed, I will continue to strengthen this security 
cooperation. I am determined to work closely with Romania as we 
stand united against the Kremlin's unprovoked, unjustified, and 
horrific war against Ukraine. Putin's aggression has only 
strengthened the Ukrainian people's desire to remain free and 
independent.
    The firm resolve of Romania has been especially laudable in 
this crisis. The country and its people have welcomed with open 
arms and hearts over 2.5 million Ukrainian refugees, more than 
85,000 of which--of whom remain in the country and have 
generously supported those refugees with critical assistance 
and essential services.
    In addition, Romania has supported unprecedented sanctions 
to weaken Putin's war machine and aided Ukraine through a wide 
range of other humanitarian and security efforts. Nor has 
Romania shied away from pushing back on the People's Republic 
of China's attempts to impose coercive economic arrangements on 
countries in Central Europe.
    Romania passed 5G legislation that excludes untrusted 
vendors from its 5G tender, blocked greater PRC involvement in 
Romania civil nuclear industry, and instituted robust 
investment screening legislation to protect its critical 
infrastructure.
    If confirmed, I will coordinate closely with Romanian 
authorities to counter efforts by the PRC Government to pursue 
steps that would weaken Romanian National Security or economic 
standing. I also pledged to work on deepening and broadening 
our economic cooperation with Romania.
    I will encourage Romania's efforts to foster a business 
climate that facilitates U.S. investment. The country's efforts 
to advance clean energy technologies, including in nuclear and 
other renewables, are already model for the region.
    Finally, I stand ready to support Romania's efforts to 
fight corruption and strengthen its democratic institutions, 
including in supporting a free press. In sum, I will commit 
myself to expanding our long standing American partnership with 
Romania.
    This year, the United States and Romania are celebrating 
the 25th anniversary of our bilateral strategic partnership. I 
look forward to taking the next steps in building upon this 
very strong foundation.
    Thank you for the opportunity to appear today and I look 
forward to your questions.

               Prepared Statement of Kathleen Ann Kavalec

    Thank you, Chairwoman Shaheen, Ranking Member Portman, and 
distinguished members of the committee. I am honored to appear before 
you today as President Biden's nominee for U.S. Ambassador to Romania. 
As we speak, Secretary Blinken is in Bucharest, which underscores the 
importance of our long-standing partnership with Romania. Thank you for 
your consideration of my nomination.
    Allow me first to introduce my husband, Mark Taplin, a retired FSO, 
and my three children, Ben, Sam, and Gwen. I want to thank them from 
the bottom of my heart for all the great support they have given me in 
my career.
    I had the pleasure of serving in Romania once before, as Cultural 
Affairs Officer at Embassy Bucharest. In that role, I traveled 
throughout the country to carry out our public diplomacy programs and 
expand our network of ``American Corners''--resource centers where 
Romanians can learn more about American culture, history, and 
government.
    I gained an appreciation for cultural exchange from my late father, 
a Spanish instructor, Fulbright grantee, and proponent of good 
listening skills, which are critical to effective diplomacy. In my 
diplomatic career, I have focused on building coalitions, nurturing 
relationships, and listening. If confirmed, I look forward to applying 
these and other core diplomatic principles to America's vital 
relationship with Romania.
    To that end, please allow me to outline my policy priorities that 
will guide my work as U.S. Ambassador to Romania, if confirmed. First, 
I will commit myself foremost to the safety and security of our Mission 
team and of U.S. citizens living, working, and traveling in Romania.
    Second, if confirmed, I will advance our cooperation with Romania 
on vital security matters. Since the end of the Communist dictatorship 
in 1989, Romania has made remarkable progress in building a genuine 
democracy and market economy. Romania made it clear, early on, that its 
goal was to join NATO and the European Union, and through hard work and 
determination, the country and its people succeeded. I was on hand in 
2008 when Romania hosted the Bucharest NATO summit, a source of pride 
for the entire country. My family and I joined the celebrations in 
Sibiu on New Year's Day 2007--led by the then mayor, now President 
Klaus Iohannis--that greeted Romania's official accession to the EU.
    Today, Romania is a model for other NATO members. It has budgeted 2 
percent of its GDP for defense--and most recently committed to raising 
its defense budget to 2.5 percent, much of it allocated to purchase 
U.S. equipment in its robust modernization effort. It hosts 
multinational NATO forces and is a longstanding contributor to NATO 
missions and operations worldwide. If confirmed, I will continue 
strengthen this security cooperation.
    I am determined to work closely with Romania as we stand united 
against the Kremlin's unprovoked, unjustified, and horrific war against 
Ukraine. The firm resolve of Romania has been especially laudable in 
this crisis. The country and its people have welcomed, with open arms 
and hearts, over two and a half million Ukrainian refugees, more than 
85,000 of whom remain in the country, and have generously supported 
these refugees with critical assistance and essential services. In 
addition, Romania has supported unprecedented sanctions to weaken 
Putin's war machine and aided Ukraine through a wide range of other 
humanitarian and security efforts.
    Nor has Romania shied from pushing back on the People's Republic of 
China's attempts to impose coercive economic arrangements on countries 
in Central Europe. Romania passed 5G legislation that excludes 
untrusted vendors from its 5G tender, blocked greater PRC involvement 
in Romania's civil nuclear industry, and instituted robust investment 
screening legislation to protect its critical infrastructure. If 
confirmed, I will coordinate closely with Romanian authorities to 
counter efforts by the PRC Government to pursue steps that would weaken 
Romanian's national security or economic standing.
    I also pledge to work on deepening and broadening our economic 
cooperation with Romania. I will encourage Romania's efforts to foster 
a business climate that facilitates U.S. investment. The country's 
efforts to advance clean energy technologies, including in nuclear and 
other renewables, are already a model for the region.
    Finally, I stand ready to support Romania's efforts to fight 
corruption and strengthen its democratic institutions, including in 
supporting a free and independent media.
    In sum, I will commit myself to expanding our longstanding American 
partnership with Romania. This year, the United States and Romania are 
celebrating the 25th anniversary of our bilateral Strategic 
Partnership. I look forward to taking the next steps in in building 
upon this strong foundation.
    Thank you for the opportunity to appear today and I look forward to 
your questions.


    Senator Shaheen. Thank you very much. Mr. Sabet.

  STATEMENT OF BIJAN SABET OF MASSACHUSETTS, NOMINATED TO BE 
  AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED 
            STATES OF AMERICA TO THE CZECH REPUBLIC

    Mr. Sabet. Thank you, Chairwoman Shaheen, Ranking Member 
Portman, and distinguished members of this committee. And thank 
you, Senator Markey, for the kind introduction. It is a 
profound honor to be--to appear before you as President Biden's 
nominee to serve as the United States Ambassador to the Czech 
Republic.
    I want to express my gratitude to the President and 
Secretary Blinken for the confidence they have placed in me 
with this nomination. Before I begin, I would like to introduce 
my family, starting with my wife, Lauren, who is here today.
    Lauren is my best friend and partner who makes everything I 
do possible. She is also the daughter of a Delaware police 
officer who is privileged to know the President who once 
chaired this committee. Our three wonderful children, Sophia, 
Ella, and James, are watching online. I love you so much and I 
am so proud to be your dad.
    If confirmed, Lauren and James will join me in Prague, and 
I know our daughters will visit as often as they can. I also 
want to recognize and thank my parents who taught me and my 
younger brother to cherish the democratic values and ideals of 
freedom and opportunity. Like so many, they immigrated to this 
country in pursuit of the American dream and became U.S. 
citizens as soon as they could.
    My father was born in Iran, where he completed medical 
school before traveling to the United States for his residency 
in the late 1960s. Here he met another young doctor, my mother, 
who had recently immigrated from South Korea. Born under 
Japanese occupation, she grew up during the Korean War with a 
deep sense of gratitude to U.S. service members who helped save 
South Korea from communism.
    I have spent the better part of my life and career 
supporting entrepreneurs, helping them make the most of their 
potential. I co-created one of our country's leading venture 
capital firms, and we have supported hundreds of startups 
leading to the creation of tens of thousands of jobs. I also 
serve on the boards of several educational institutions, 
including Boston College.
    I enjoy mentoring students and young professionals, 
particularly those with backgrounds that are underrepresented 
in the venture capital industry. If confirmed, I will bring 
that experience, energy, and focus on the next generation to 
the work that I do in the Czech Republic.
    If confirmed, I will also commit to using my experience to 
advance bilateral trade and investment by building 
relationships between the Czech and U.S. companies and 
entrepreneurs. To that end, I would like to outline five policy 
priorities that will guide my work as U.S. Ambassador to the 
Czech Republic, if confirmed.
    First, if confirmed, I will have no greater priority than 
the safety and security of the entire Embassy team and the 
thousands of U.S. citizen visitors and students who come to the 
Czech Republic each year.
    Second, if confirmed, I will support the Czech Republic in 
its outstanding efforts to promote regional security and 
protect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity against 
Russia's aggression. I will also deepen our bilateral defense 
cooperation and NATO partnership and support the negotiations 
for the purchase of American made F-35s.
    Third, if confirmed, I will promote U.S. companies as 
partners of choice for nuclear energy expansion, including 
small modular reactors and for nuclear fuel diversification. I 
will look for ways to support all clean energy sources, 
especially U.S. companies working in renewable energy.
    Now more than ever, it is time to advance energy 
diversification and security. Fourth, if confirmed, I will work 
alongside our Czech partners to honor the legacy of former 
President Vaclav Havel in promoting democracy and human rights 
worldwide, and especially in upholding media freedom and 
journalistic integrity.
    And finally, if confirmed, I pledge to keep this committee 
informed as I work to strengthen the alliance, friendship, and 
partnership between the United States and the Czech Republic.
    Madam Chair, Ranking Member Portman, and members of this 
committee, thank you again for the opportunity to appear before 
you today. I welcome your questions.

    Madam Chair, Ranking Member Portman, and members of the committee, 
thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today. I 
welcome your questions.


    Senator Shaheen. Well, thank you all very much. Ms. Kavalec 
And Mr. Merten, I would like to begin with both of you, as you 
are being nominated to be Ambassador to two countries that 
border the Black Sea. And what we have seen since Russia's 
unprovoked war in Ukraine is just how important the Black Sea 
region is.
    Senator Romney, who also sits on the Foreign Relations 
committee, and I have legislation that would call for an 
interagency strategy on how we approach the Black Sea region.
    I wonder if either of you can speak to what current 
strategy is, with respect to the Black Sea region, and how you 
think we should be working to advance greater regional 
cooperation among Black Sea countries? And I do not know, which 
one of you wants to go first? Mr. Merten.
    Mr. Merten. Happy to start. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 
First of all, we want to thank you for your leadership on this 
area, in this area, in this geographic region. I think recent 
events have borne out how really important this area is for 
several of our allies and friendly nations in the area.
    And I think a redoubled focus on the Black Sea is well-
deserved. I know the Administration is, led by the NSC, is 
looking at ways we can operationalize some of our activities 
overseas. In the Bulgarian context, I will just say we are 
working hard to support Bulgarian defense modernization, 
including working with their navy so they can protect their 
seas.
    I think we need to work with all friendly nations in the 
area to continue to ensure that commercial activity and benign 
naval activity can continue unimpeded in the Black Sea. So 
should I be lucky enough to get confirmed, you have my 
commitment to stay in touch with you and your colleagues, your 
staff.
    If you have ideas that we can advocate for, we are happy to 
hear them and happy to work further on them. I will pass it 
over to Kathy.
    Ms. Kavalec. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Shaheen, for 
that question, and also for your interest and support in this 
region. And that also from Senator Romney. I think it is really 
important to raise the profile of this area as we have seen in 
this terrible war how important this region is and what the 
risks are.
    Of course, the first priority is to ensure that Ukraine 
prevails in the war. But we--and in there, in that respect, we 
have been focusing on deepening our engagement in the region, 
expanding our presence in the littoral countries since February 
24th.
    I think, as you know, there is a new rotational brigade 
combat team in Romania. And we are also looking at energy 
security and diversification as an important component of 
supporting this region and strengthening the Black Sea area.
    So very much look forward to working with you and to 
supporting the Administration as it develops an approach that--
on an interagency basis to strengthen this area.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you both very much for that. Mr. 
Robinson and Mr. Kent, the countries that you are nominated to 
be Ambassadors for, Latvia and Estonia, along with Lithuania, 
really are impressive in terms of their shared economic and 
National Security interests with the United States.
    I think certainly they have punched above their weight, to 
use a cliche, in terms of NATO and their willingness to stand 
up to Russia and its fight against Ukraine. So, can you talk 
about how you will continue to work together to foster this 
collective advocacy for Baltic Sea countries? Mr. Robinson, you 
want to begin?
    Mr. Robinson. Thank you, Chairwoman Shaheen. I think the 
Baltic cooperation on this is fundamental. I think all three 
countries, but I can speak to Latvia, view Russia as an 
existential threat, and the tragedies and the horrors that we 
have seen in Ukraine only amplify and deepen the sense of--that 
we need to work together as a transatlantic community to 
counter and deter that threat for the long term.
    That even as Ukraine makes successes on the battlefield, 
that this is a long term challenge. Senator, you have noted 
correctly, Latvia spends more than 2 percent on--to meet its 
defense commitments. It is committed to 2.5 percent by 2025 and 
is looking at even moving to 3 percent.
    With this committee's support, we have--are expect to 
provide over $145 million in foreign military financing to help 
Latvia modernize and increase its equipment purchases to better 
deter Russian aggression for the future.
    And, of course, as the Center for--hosting the NATO's 
Center for Strategic Communications Excellence, it has been at 
the forefront of helping to develop tools and techniques to 
counter Russian disinformation, for example.
    So I think there are many, many ways that we continue to 
foster that cooperation, both among the three countries, in 
their defense outlook, in their energy security issues, but 
also directly with bilaterally, with Latvia to deepen that 
partnership.
    Ms. Kavalec. Thank you. Mr. Kent.
    Mr. Kent. Chairwoman Shaheen, Chris and I worked this sort 
of issues together as Deputy Assistant Secretaries of State, 
and we will be happy to continue that cooperation in the 
Baltics, if confirmed.
    The Baltic foreign ministers were just in Kyiv yesterday 
together along with their Nordic counterparts, and I think this 
shows the strength of regional cooperation. It is why Sweden 
and Finland's joining NATO, if all members agree, are going to 
strengthen our Northern and Eastern flanks.
    And I think the security assistance and security spending 
that Chris mentioned is also critically important for Estonia. 
They have been receiving additional funds thanks to the 
appropriations from Congress, and they are dedicating that to 
buy the HIMARS system, which is also very well-known now from 
Ukraine.
    For every dollar that we have given in security assistance, 
the Estonians have spent $2.60 of their own money. So I think 
this is showing how wise leveraging of our resources can 
contribute to common security for us all.
    And you have our commitment to continue to work with you 
and with each other, if confirmed.
    Ms. Kavalec. Thank you both very much. Senator Hagerty.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Chair Shaheen. And to all of 
you, a hearty congratulations. I can think of no greater honor 
than to represent the most exceptional Nation in the world to 
the various countries that you are going to be serving. So my 
congratulations to you for your nomination, and my appreciation 
to all of your families who are going to support you a great 
deal.
    Those of you who are career service officers know this and 
thank you for your service. And to you, Mr. Sabet, you will 
learn it in a way, I think, that will be very positive. And I 
might stay with you, Mr. Sabet, for a moment.
    I was pleased to hear your commitment to work with the 
Czech Republic to continue to strengthen the alliance there 
with NATO and deal with the situation that Russia has created 
in Ukraine. I encourage you to continue to work in that 
direction. There is an area I have a greater concern about, 
even more so than Russia, and that is China.
    And the Ukrainian--I am sorry, the Czech Government has 
demonstrated a determination to actually support and deepen 
ties with Taiwan. In fact, legislative leader of the Taiwan 
Legislative one actually visited the Czech Republic earlier 
this year. And he said, and I would like to quote, ``the Czech 
Republic is a sanctuary of democracy for the whole world. I 
appreciate your support and help for Taiwan in times of need.''
    I very much appreciated that comment, and I would like to 
ask you first, if you are confirmed, how will you work with the 
Czech Government with respect to deepening their ties to 
Taiwan?
    Mr. Sabet. Thank you, Senator, for the question. And you 
raise a very important point. I mean, Prime Minister Fiala's 
government has made it clear that they have a very firm stance 
towards China. In fact, there is broad skepticism towards China 
throughout the Government. The Czech Republic has had a 
critical stance on China, for China's position on Russia, given 
the illegal war against Ukraine.
    The Czechs are participating in the 14 plus 1 framework but 
have received very little investment from the PRC. And in fact, 
recently the Senate, the Czech Senate on Foreign Relations 
passed a non-binding resolution to leave the 14 plus 1, which 
is quite--it was quite positive.
    As you mentioned, the Czech Republic has made real strides 
in collaborating with Taiwan, both economically and 
academically. And I think this is important to emphasize and to 
support. I have read this, Senator Risch's report on China from 
2020 out of this committee. So if confirmed, I will bring 
those, many of those concerns to the post and be mindful of 
those with me.
    And if confirmed, I will work with the Embassy team to look 
for every opportunity to support the Czech Republic's effort to 
counter malign influence, support their efforts to screen out 
untrusted vendors, and to implement their cybersecurity 
efforts.
    Senator Hagerty. Excellent. Given your background in 
technology, I think you will be a tremendous asset in advising 
the Czech Government and particularly on dealing with 
situations like--that are presented by companies like ZTE and 
Huawei.
    So thank you for that. I would like to turn to, so you work 
with the Embassy staff there. There is a--in my conversations, 
I understand there have been some issues in the management 
section of Embassy Prague. Are you aware of the issues and do 
you have an update on the status of those? Have they been 
resolved?
    Mr. Sabet. You know, my understanding is, from everyone I 
have spoken to, is the Embassy Prague team is an outstanding 
team, both direct American hires and our locally employed 
staff.
    I think the challenge in the Czech Republic is you have 
very low unemployment, very high inflation, and I think 
recruiting our attention are the highest priority management 
challenges.
    Senator Hagerty. I encourage you to pay close attention to 
the situation there and it will certainly enhance your 
effectiveness to have that working well. And I understand the 
challenge you raise too, in terms of the competitive dynamic of 
the marketplace. You mentioned something that is a keen 
interest to me, and that is your desire to work with the Czech 
Government to advance investments in energy sources such as 
nuclear energy, small modular reactors.
    I just would like to remind you that I am a Senator from 
the State of Tennessee. Oak Ridge National Labs, an entire 
industry is built up there that could be very helpful in that 
regard. So if you are confirmed, I would encourage you to reach 
out to find a way to work together, and I would love to 
volunteer resources from my home State to come and assist.
    When I was Ambassador to Japan, they came over to help me 
in dealing with some situations that had arisen around 
Fukushima. I think you might find it very helpful as you 
advance that arena. And congratulations for a businessperson 
stepping into this role.
    I think you will bring a unique set of capabilities and 
perspective, should you be confirmed. Thank you.
    Mr. Sabet. Thank you. You have my commitment.
    Senator Shaheen. Spoken from experience, Senator Hagerty? 
Senator Kaine.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Chairman Shaheen, and 
congratulations to the members of this panel. Highly qualified. 
I am just going to ask one question and I would like maybe, Mr. 
Robinson, you to address it and then just move from my right to 
left, and it deals with energy policy.
    I am very, very complimentary of the Biden Administration 
strategy to forge very diverse nations into a quite unified 
coalition and support Ukraine against the Russian illegal 
invasion. I do not think it is perfect, though.
    And here is an area where I am troubled and increasingly 
troubled, and that is, I think sometimes U.S. energy policy, we 
want to do a number of different things that are often in 
conflict with each other. We want to promote green energy to 
fight climate change. We should do that.
    We want our allies to develop their own energy resources. 
They should do that. We also want to help our allies wean 
themselves away from overreliance on petro dictators like 
Russia or Iran or the Saudis or Venezuela. We should do that.
    Sometimes those are inconsistent goals, and I have yet 
really to hear the Biden Administration articulate a harmonized 
view of the way we can accomplish those things. The way to do 
it is probably through phasing.
    I am not going to ask you to respond to my critique, but 
here is where I am worried. Recently, statements out of the EU 
have shown some anxiety about U.S. policies. As their energy 
prices go, as we are starting to take some trade actions with 
respect to green energy that affects some of their domestic 
industries, you see rumblings out of the EU.
    As we are coming into the winter that could get worse. So 
what can the U.S. do to help each of the countries that you 
hope to be in to deal with the energy crises that are acute all 
over the world, but particularly acute in Europe with nations 
that have had to rely upon Russian energy sources?
    And Mr. Robinson, I would like to start with you.
    Mr. Robinson. Thank you, Senator Kaine. And I agree this is 
really one of the most foremost issues. Whether it is 
countering Russian aggression or deepening our bilateral 
partnership or enhancing transatlantic security, and above all, 
addressing climate issues for the long term, is to get these 
issues right.
    I also want to say, having been Deputy Assistant Secretary 
for Russia, my enormous gratitude to this committee for its 
leadership on European energy issues over a number of years. 
That strong bipartisan voice has been very clear, from CAATSA 
to PEESA, and I thank the committee for the leadership on that.
    With regard to Latvia, I think this is where we have great 
opportunity to address the convergence of these different 
issues, as you rightly point out. Latvia is committed to--has 
long warned that Russia uses energy as a weapon, and they need 
it to transition to other sources and means for energy for its 
own National Security.
    They get nearly 50 percent of their electrical energy from 
hydro, and they are looking to expand into wind and other 
sources of renewable that provide an opportunity for U.S. 
bilateral partnership. As my colleagues have also mentioned, 
Latvia has joined, like others, the first program at the State 
Department to look into small modular nuclear reactors.
    And then lastly, they are looking at increasing and they 
have prioritized for the near term increasing LNG imports and 
have--are looking to build a new terminal to be able to expand 
that. So Latvia has committed to moving to carbon neutral by 
2050, and really prides itself on making progress in this area.
    So I think there is a lot of opportunity for U.S., Latvia 
bilateral partnership and our companies and our technology in 
these areas to do this, both to address climate and also to 
enhance energy security for the region.
    Senator Kaine. Mr. Kent, without repeating anything that 
Mr. Robinson has said.
    Mr. Kent. Estonia's area of current expertise is in shale 
oil production, and that is where they get over 50 percent of 
their energy. Like Latvia, they are interested in exploring 
small modular reactors where U.S. technology could help.
    A shared challenge that Baltics faces, that their 
electricity grid is still tied to Russia and Belarus. And so I 
think our national labs have expertise in gaming out how they 
might be able to accelerate switching to the European energy 
grid.
    So again, I think combination of our expertise as well as 
our technology can help Estonia be independent, and they are 
cutting themselves off of Russian oil and gas ahead of the EU 
deadlines because for them it is a matter of principle, and 
they are willing to pay for the inflated costs of energy.
    Senator Kaine. Mr. Merten.
    Mr. Merten. Well, we have been working with Bulgaria on 
diversifying their energy, both supply and the types of energy 
they use. I am happy to report that on the 1st of October, the 
Bulgarians and Greeks opened up the interconnected Greece-
Bulgaria, which will allow the Bulgarians to receive gas from 
Azerbaijan.
    As of right now, I understand they receive no Russian gas 
anymore, which is good. Russia cut them off in April. We are 
also, the Embassy and we will continue to do this should I be 
confirmed, have been working with them to look into their 
nuclear energy supply, how they can develop that further.
    We are looking--we have funded a $300,000 study to help 
them explore options with small modular reactors. We are 
working with them on resourcing their supply of nuclear fuel 
for their existing plants. Currently, those are supplied by 
Russia. We believe that Westinghouse could be another source 
for them.
    So we are looking at other options. Bulgaria has got a lot 
of attention from the Administration. We have had--Amos 
Hochstein has been out there. Our Assistant Secretary for 
Energy, Geoff Pyatt, has recently been to Bulgaria.
    This is front and center of our relationship and will 
remain so, should I be lucky enough to be confirmed.
    Senator Kaine. I am over time, but could I ask the other 
two to give----
    Senator Shaheen. Absolutely----
    Senator Kaine.--pithy responses?
    Ms. Kavalec. Thank you so much for the question. This is 
also a huge priority for Romania, which is fortunate in that it 
has already greatly diversified its energy system, and with 
U.S. help is doing--will be expanding in the area of nuclear 
power.
    Romania recently signed an agreement with U.S. company 
Nuscale on small modular reactors and is seeking to become a 
center in Europe for this technology. Also recently, EXIM 
signed two letters of interest to help complete the build out 
of the Cernavoda nuclear power plant for different locations.
    So that is another area I will be following up on in my--if 
I am confirmed. A US led consortium in Black Sea oil is also 
working to bring Black Sea gas online from Romania. And Romania 
has also shown its leadership in providing energy to Moldova, 
which is suffering from, you know, the cut off from energy 
supplies from Russia. So I will be following up in all these 
areas.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you. Mr. Sabet.
    Mr. Sabet. Senator Kaine, thank you for the question. The 
Czech Republic has had a historic reliance on Russia for 
natural gas and oil. I think 97 percent of their natural gas 
consumption has come from Russia.
    So it is a substantial issue. You know, the United States 
is engaged in a number of areas here. Number one is 
establishing new energy sources, new energy distribution 
routes, fuel types, etcetera. I am pleased that Westinghouse, 
an American company, has won the tender for the nuclear 
facility in Dukovany. It is a 10 year agreement, which is a big 
step to transitioning from nuclear energy.
    There is currently another tender, a second facility at 
Temelin. And we are clearly hoping that that also goes towards 
Westinghouse. And if I am confirmed, I will be an active 
advocate for U.S. interests there.
    The Czech also seeks to be a first mover with SMRs in 
Europe. The company is engaged with six pilots at the moment, 
and U.S. companies are involved in a number of these 
negotiations. And if confirmed, I will be advocating for those 
procurement opportunities as well to make sure we are on a 
level playing field.
    And I commit to you that I will advocate for clean energy 
sources as a way to not only deal with our climate crisis, but 
as a way to deal with energy security and independence for the 
Czech Republic.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you so much. Thanks, Chairman Shaheen.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Senator Kaine. I would like to 
do another round of questions. I have a couple more questions. 
I want to go back to the conversation we had about the 
commitment from both Latvia and Estonia to NATO and to 
complying with the 2 percent of their defense spend 
commitments.
    And just ask for those of you representing other countries, 
Mr. Spent and Mr. Merten most specifically, how can we 
encourage both the Czech Republic and Bulgaria to reach their 2 
percent of GDP requirement for NATO? Mr. Merten.
    Mr. Merten. Thank you, Senator, for the question. We have 
been working with the Bulgarians, and we were very happy that 
they signed an agreement with us to buy one tranche of F-16 
fighters.
    This was a major investment for them, $1.3 billion. This is 
not the European Union's richest country, and for them to 
devote those kind of resources to that, we think that is pretty 
important. We are delighted that the parliament has approved 
their purchase of an additional eight F-16s.
    This is going to be a big investment for them, and this is 
going to take them, I think, a long way into meeting their 
commitments. You know, they have--certainly should I be lucky 
enough to be confirmed, we will continue to encourage them to 
do their utmost to work with us on defense modernization, 
focusing their procurement on American products.
    And I think we are going to be, I hope we will be pushing 
on an open door there.
    Senator Shaheen. That is encouraging, and I appreciate that 
they have many challenges that they are dealing with. Mr. 
Sabet.
    Mr. Sabet. Senator Shahee, thank you for the question--
Chairman Shaheen. You know, the Czech Republic is an important 
NATO ally and security partner with a strong track record of 
joint missions in Europe and elsewhere.
    The Czechs served courageously with the United States in 
Afghanistan, and the Czechs are a framework Nation leading a 
new NATO battle group in Slovakia and have contributed 650 
troops. It is the case the Czechs are currently short of their 
NATO's commitment this year. They have, in their budget 1.35 
percent of GDP for their military spend.
    But they have announced that they are going to meet their 
NATO pledge in their Wales defense investment targets by 2024. 
In addition to the procurement of eight Bell Textron 
helicopters, the Foreign Ministry of the Czech Republic is 
pursuing foreign military sales of 24 F-35s.
    And if I am confirmed, you have my commitment to be an 
active advocate to help the Czechs achieve their goals for 
their NATO commitments and advancing their military capacity.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you. Thank you all very much. 
Senator Cruz.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. Welcome to each of 
the witnesses. Mr. Kent, you have been outspoken throughout 
your career, speaking against corruption. And I want to talk 
about corruption. I want to talk in particular about corruption 
in the current Administration.
    And I have serious concerns about corruption of President 
Joe Biden that extends for considerable time, both his time as 
President and his time as Vice President. To take one obvious 
and troubling example, accounts linked to the Biden family's 
personal finances received millions of dollars through ties to 
CEFC China Energy.
    This is where we get the infamous quote about 10 percent to 
the big guy from the Chinese communists. But you have also been 
involved very directly with Ukraine and corruption in Ukraine.
    And I will say, you showed real courage speaking out 
against what I think was the very obvious concerns of 
corruption of Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in Ukraine 
in particular. On November 13th, 2019, you testified to 
Congress that you had become concerned with Hunter Biden's 
status as a board member of the Ukrainian natural gas company 
Burisma.
    You said you would raise those concerns to the White House 
in February of 20, 2015, and in particular what you said, ``as 
I became aware that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma, 
soon after that, in a briefing call with the National Security 
staff at the office of the Vice President in February of 2015, 
I raised my concern that Hunter Biden's status as a board 
member could create a perception of a conflict of interest.''
    Tell me, why did you have this concern about, as you 
described, a perception of a conflict of interest?
    Mr. Kent. Well, Senator, I can give you and every member of 
this committee my commitments that I will always raise concerns 
to members of any Administration and to Congress when I have 
concerns.
    And so I was made aware of information, and I passed that 
along to the staff of the Office of the Vice President.
    Senator Cruz. So why were you concerned? Why were you 
concerned about Hunter Biden being on the board of Burisma?
    Mr. Kent. The issue at hand was the owner of the companies, 
Zlochevsky, had awarded himself gas contracts. And as I 
testified both in the impeachment hearings and in the Johnson, 
Grassley hearings of 2020, our concern was about the corrupt 
acts of Zlochevsky, the ex-minister, and the FBI had been 
pursuing freezing his assets, and it was in the interest of the 
United States to remain at the gold standard of our own 
actions.
    Senator Cruz. So the Ukrainian oligarch who owned Burisma, 
there was very substantial evidence of corruption on his part, 
and he named Hunter Biden to his board of directors. To your 
knowledge, does Hunter Biden speak Ukrainian?
    Mr. Kent. I have never talked to Hunter Biden, no.
    Senator Cruz. To your knowledge, did you have any knowledge 
before serving on that board about anything concerning oil or 
natural gas?
    Mr. Kent. I am not aware of his CV.
    Senator Cruz. To your knowledge, did Hunter Biden have any 
qualification whatsoever for that board job other than the fact 
that his daddy was the sitting Vice President at the time?
    Mr. Kent. Senator, I--no one consulted me about who was on 
the board of Burisma. There was another American, Cofer Black, 
who was a former----
    Senator Cruz. I asked a question, to your knowledge, did 
Hunter Biden have any qualification to be on that board other 
than the job his daddy had at the moment?
    Mr. Kent. I am not familiar with his resume, sir.
    Senator Cruz. Okay. He was paid $83,000 a month by this 
Ukrainian oligarch. You are an expert in Ukraine. Have you ever 
been paid $83,000 a month?
    Mr. Kent. I am a public servant, sir. I have never served 
on a corporate board.
    Senator Cruz. So does that mean, no, you have not been paid 
$83,000 a month?
    Mr. Kent. I have not been paid $83,000, no, sir.
    Senator Cruz. So, look, the concern here is not Hunter 
Biden's own problems, but rather it is official corruption from 
the then Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, and 
now the President of the United States, Joe Biden. Let me ask 
you, while his son was on the board of Burisma, making $1 
million a year, did Joe Biden do anything that benefited the 
corrupt oligarch who was paying his son?
    Mr. Kent. Vice President Biden led our efforts to fight 
corruption in Ukraine.
    Senator Cruz. Let me ask you the question again, did Vice 
President Joe Biden do anything that benefited the corrupt 
oligarch who was paying his son $1 million a year?
    Mr. Kent. He did not.
    Senator Cruz. He did not. Well, it is interesting, someone 
who disagrees with you, Mr. Kent, is Joe Biden. And I want to 
read from what he said on January 23rd, 2018, at the Council on 
Foreign Relations, quote, this is Joe Biden speaking, ``and I 
went over, I guess the 12th, 13th time to Kyiv, and I was 
supposed to announce that there was another billion dollar loan 
guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and 
Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state 
prosecutor,'' the prosecutor that was investigating Burisma, 
``and they did not.''
    So Biden continues, ``I said, no, I am not going to--we are 
not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have 
no authority. You are not the President. The President said--I 
said, call him. I said, I am telling you, you are not getting 
the billion dollars. I said, you are not getting the billion 
dollars. I am going to be leaving here. And I think it was 
about six hours. I looked at them and said, I am leaving here 
in six hours, if the prosecutor is not fired, you are not 
getting the money. Well, son of a bitch, he got fired.''
    Let me ask you something, do you think Joe Biden holding $1 
billion hostage to force the Ukrainian Government to fire the 
prosecutor that is investigating the corrupt oligarch who is 
paying his son $1 million a year, did getting that prosecutor 
fired benefit that oligarch?
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Senator Cruz. Senator Van 
Hollen.
    Senator Cruz. Are you going to allow me to answer the 
question, Madam Chairman?
    Senator Shaheen. I am not going to allow him to answer the 
question.
    Senator Cruz. Why are you covering for the Vice President? 
Do you not want him to answer that question? He said that the 
Vice President did nothing to benefit the oligarch----
    Senator Shaheen. I think it is unfortunate for you, Senator 
Cruz, to put in positions that are uncomfortable the nominees 
to be our Ambassadors.
    Senator Cruz. Okay, this is a sworn testimony--this is a 
sworn testimony. I understand that you want to cover for----
    Senator Shaheen. And he already answered----
    Senator Cruz.--the Vice President----
    Senator Shaheen.--that he is going to raise those concerns 
any time he has responsibility----
    Senator Cruz. Was his testimony true or false that Biden 
did nothing to benefit the oligarch?
    Senator Shaheen. I do not know what his testimony----
    Senator Cruz. Let him answer the question. Why are you 
afraid of him answering the question?
    Senator Shaheen. I am not. I just want to move on because 
the votes have started----
    Senator Cruz. But you will not let him answer it. I asked a 
yes or no question. Will you allow him to answer the yes or no 
question?
    Senator Shaheen. Yes, you can answer yes or no. Thank you.
    Mr. Kent. The prosecutor who was fired by the Ukrainian 
parliament did nothing to investigate Zlochevsky. And 
everything the Vice President Biden, the State Department and 
the U.S. Embassy did acted in good faith to reduce corruption 
and help the Ukrainians.
    Senator Cruz. So firing him did not benefit the oligarch?
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Senator Cruz. Senator Van 
Hollen.
    Senator Cruz. You are protecting the President well.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. And 
I am going to return in a moment to the comments of Senator 
Cruz. But first, congratulations to all of you on your 
nominations.
    To all of you are Foreign Service Officers, thank you and 
your families. I grew up in a Foreign Service family. I 
appreciate all that you do. And Mr. Sabet, congratulations to 
you. And I do want to echo the comments made by my colleague, 
Senator Hagerty, regarding the importance of making sure that 
the Czech Republic is not bullied by China because of its 
relationship with Taiwan.
    I think it is very important that the United States, 
whether in the Czech Republic, Lithuania, other parts or places 
around the world, makes it clear that the United States is 
going to respond to that bullying by making clear we support 
those relationships.
    Mr. Kent, let me just say at the beginning, and I think you 
underscored this in your testimony, that there has been 
absolutely no evidence zero, including in the Johnson, Grassley 
investigation, suggesting that the State Department, you, or 
the Vice President, Vice President Biden at the time, or any 
other officials made any changes to U.S. policy because of 
Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board, is not that true?
    Mr. Kent. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Van Hollen. And Senator Cruz, if he would read the 
results, the investigations conducted in the Congress itself 
and the testimony, would know that full well. I wish we saw the 
same level of outrage back in the day when the Trump 
administration was withholding badly needed weapons to Ukraine 
in order to get the Ukrainian Government the time to come up 
and manufacture dirt on the Biden family.
    I did not hear a lot from my colleague, Senator Cruz, 
complaining about that at the time. Now, if I could just turn 
quickly to the issue of Estonia. And Mr. Kent, you may know, 
you may not know, the State of Maryland has a special 
relationship with Estonia. We have a long time relationship 
between the Maryland National Guard and the Estonian military 
in the area of cybersecurity.
    We have a number of sister city relationships between 
cities in Estonia and in Maryland, so I look forward to working 
with you to further cement the ties between the State of 
Maryland and Estonia. Let me ask you about the issue of money 
laundering in Estonia.
    And I think you know that Estonia over the years has had 
trouble within its banking system for being a place where 
Russian oligarchs go to launder a lot of their money. I know 
they are making progress.
    What is your assessment of the situation today, and what 
can we do to help them strengthen the security of their banking 
system with respect to anti-money laundering efforts?
    Mr. Kent. Thank you for the question, Senator. And I am 
also very grateful for the Maryland National Guard for that 
great State partnership. So we welcome you to come often and 
help support that process.
    In terms of the integrity of the financial system, I think 
this is a challenge that both Estonia and Latvia have taken on. 
We do have a U.S. Secret Service representation at our Embassy 
in Estonia, and I think the U.S. law enforcement community, as 
well as my Treasury colleagues, are committed to work with 
Estonia to ensure that their financial system is also free from 
malign influence and undermining of dirty money from Russia in 
particular, but in general.
    So you have my commitment to work with you, your 
colleagues, and with Estonian colleagues to ensure that they 
are not--their systems are--have integrity and can avoid being 
undermined by malign influences.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. And Ambassador Merten, I 
listened to the testimony, and I agree that all of the 
countries where you are going to be the United States 
representatives or Ambassadors to have been firm in standing up 
against Putin's aggression and support in Ukraine.
    In the case of in the case of Bulgaria, there is a 
particular energy situation pending right now that I do not 
think has been discussed, and that is the question of their 
continuing relationship with Lucas Oil and their decision to 
continue refining that oil, not just for domestic purposes, not 
just for domestic purposes, which I get, but for exports.
    Where, as you know, there is a real, very real question as 
to whether that violates the commitment undertaken by the EU 
not to import Russian oil. Can you speak to that issue and how 
you might help reduce Bulgaria's dependance on Russian oil?
    And as you well know, we have a December 5th, I believe, 
date coming up where the United States is leading an effort to 
impose a price cap on Russian oil, and how will their decision, 
if they continue to export that oil, how would that impact 
that?
    Mr. Merten. Well, thanks for the question, Senator. I am 
not going to pretend to be an expert in all the ins and outs of 
this complex issue. I do know that, as I mentioned earlier, 
that energy issues are front and center of the State 
Department's engagement with the Government of Bulgaria.
    We have had visits by Amos Hochstein, as well as our Energy 
Assistant Secretary, Greg Pyatt out there. We have been working 
with the Bulgarians to look at ways that they can reduce this. 
This is a historical legacy commitment, as I understand it, 
which is obviously problematic in the current circumstances.
    I think we need to be working closely with our other 
European colleagues, those in the EU and those in the European 
Commission, to see what mechanisms we can--what tools we can 
give the Bulgarians to break this relationship.
    It might take a little bit of time, but I think it is 
worth--you will certainly have my commitment that I will work 
on that.
    Senator Van Hollen. [Technical problems]--Madam Chair. I do 
think it is important we have a united front. I think we need 
to support the EU decision to not continue to import Russian 
oil.
    And the reason the Bulgarian decision is troubling is not 
so much the part of it where they would continue to use that 
oil for their own consumption, but if they continue to export 
that, that is obviously a leak in the regime and breaks that 
united front.
    So I hope you will convey at least my concerns about that 
decision. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen. Senator 
Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Thanks, Madam Chairman. Congratulations 
to all of you. Mr. Robinson, I want to visit with you about 
some of my trips to Latvia and discussions with Latvia leaders 
over the last decade and a half. The security of our NATO 
allies is critically important, especially in light of the 
increased aggression from Russia, but also from China.
    And as a result, NATO is focused on increasing its presence 
in the Baltic States, increasing the amount of military aid 
being given to the countries to strengthen their defenses. What 
additional efforts could help Latvia bolster its security? And 
what can specifically be done by the U.S. to reinforce 
Latvians' defenses?
    Mr. Robinson. Great. Thank you, Senator Barrasso. And thank 
you for your leadership and your engagement with Latvia and on 
a range of transatlantic security issues over a number of 
years. Latvia is committed to increasing its defense 
expenditure, including on military equipment.
    As I have mentioned before, we expect to provide $145 
million in additional foreign military financing to help Latvia 
in this effort. They are looking at anti-ship missiles, HIMARS 
systems, aircraft. They will be receiving Black Hawks in the 
year ahead. They--Canada is the lead Nation for the NATO 
battalion, and we are working very closely with Canada and 
Latvia to make sure that those commitments and presence is 
there. And as you know well, Senator, we have committed to a 
heel to toe presence in the Baltics.
    We have increased our tempo of exercise and presence. We 
just had a Coast Guard cutter in Latvia a few weeks ago as 
another visible manifestation of that. So I think all these 
platforms provide ways that we can build and deepen this 
partnership for what will be a long term challenge to counter 
and deter Russian aggression and bolster Latvian security.
    Senator Barrasso. And Mr. Kent, moving next door to 
Estonia, earlier this year, Estonia announced their intent to 
end imports of Russian gas by the end of this year.
    In April, Finland and Estonia agreed to develop that 
floating liquefied natural gas terminal. They have since agreed 
to charter a vessel for U.S. based energy for 10 years. How 
soon will that joint floating storage and regasification unit 
will come online? I am not sure, do you know?
    Mr. Kent. I believe it is starting this winter and it is 
going to be located in Finland, sir.
    Senator Barrasso. And what impact do you think it is going 
to have on energy security in all of Europe?
    Mr. Kent. I think the variety of locations that are 
increasing take-on points of LNG really helps the region and 
because they then have interconnectors. Putting additional gas 
into the system helps regionally these countries survive the 
lack of Russian sources and pressures from Russia.
    Senator Barrasso. Do you support increasing U.S. exports of 
natural gas to Europe to help reduce Russia's natural gas 
influence?
    Mr. Kent. Very much so, sir.
    Senator Barrasso. Okay, thanks. And then, Mr. Robertson, 
back to you on energy as well. You know, Russia uses energy 
resources as a weapon. It is a long term weapon for them. They 
get it. It is a currency. It is a universal currency. So the 
world has seen Russia cut off gas supplies to Europe.
    In July, Gazprom halted natural gas supplies to Latvia for 
a week. Latvia is working to end imports of Russian gas. In 
fact, the Latvian parliament passed legislation this summer to 
ban imports of Russian gas to enter the country by January, 
just coming up now in the next month. Do you know, what is the 
status of Latvia's efforts to end its reliance on Russian gas?
    Mr. Robinson. Thank you, Senator. Latvia does look to end 
its imports of Russian gas by 2023. I expect that they will be 
ahead of schedule. They have been looking to fill all their 
storages ahead of the winter season, and they have prioritized 
building an LNG terminal as a national priority for that--for 
investment.
    They are also looking at diversifying their sources of 
energy to small modular nuclear reactors and wind energy. So 
all these provide ways to reduce and eliminate Russia's 
dependance.
    And you have my commitment, sir, to continue to work with 
Latvia and this committee to make that process.
    Senator Barrasso. And then you support U.S. exports of 
natural gas to Europe to help replace the Russian natural gas?
    Mr. Robinson. Absolutely, Senator.
    Senator Barrasso. Great. And I think you made the point, 
you said they already filled the storage of natural gas in 
Latvia for the upcoming----
    Mr. Robinson. I believe they were working on that, and they 
expected to meet that objective.
    Senator Barrasso. Okay. And then Mr. Kent, the security of 
our NATO allies is critically important, especially in light of 
increased aggression by Russia and China. Let us--one out of 
line--there it is. To both of you in the last time I have left, 
the Baltic States reached an agreement with the European 
Commission to connect their electricity grids with Europe by 
2025.
    Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania have long been connected to 
Russian electric grid. The grid operators in Europe indicated 
that they could immediately implement the switch in the event 
if Russia cuts them off. Do you know what the status is right 
now of connecting the Baltic States to the European grid?
    Mr. Kent. Sir, they do have a plan that would take several 
years, and it is quite expensive. It is about $1 billion to 
implement. There is contingency planning, if the Russians were 
to get them off the grid, and U.S. laboratories are helping 
with that contingency planning.
    Senator Barrasso. Are there things that we could do to 
expedite that, because just we know how Russia behaves in 
situations like this?
    Mr. Robinson. I think that the concern, Senator, is that 
Russia might use that as an opportunity to disconnect the grid 
ahead of time. So as my colleague mentioned, we are working 
very closely with three countries, a number of projects 
underway to make sure that that process is ready.
    Senator Barrasso. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Senator Barrasso. I know 
that Senator Shaheen is on her way back. I do--I will take this 
opportunity, Mr. Robinson, to ask you a question. As you know, 
Latvia has become an important haven for Russian journalists 
who are fleeing persecution in Russia and has become really a 
hub, I think, for opportunities to try to get good information 
back to the people of Russia.
    Can you talk a little bit more about how we can support 
that ongoing effort so that we can get the truth to penetrate 
more of Russia's efforts to keep it out?
    Mr. Robinson. Absolutely, Senator. This is a key priority. 
And if confirmed, this will continue to be a priority for me, 
and I will work closely with this committee.
    There are two factors here. Yes, as Putin intensified his 
crackdown on his own people ahead of this war, many Russian 
human rights leaders, and importantly, independent media 
organizations fled Russia and set up their operations in 
Latvia.
    Latvia did a lot to welcome these groups in and facilitate 
their entry, and to help them get a footing to continue to 
communicate the truths about what is happening in Russia and 
Russia's war in Ukraine back to the Russian people.
    In addition, more than 30 percent of Latvia's population is 
either ethnic Russian or Russian speaking, and this provides a 
real opportunity for us to continue our public diplomacy and 
messaging efforts to reach that community and to continue our 
efforts to tell the truth about what is happening in Ukraine 
and in Russia, and Putin's atrocious war against the Ukrainian 
people.
    So we have a number of programs underway, and we are 
committed. We thank the committee for its support for those 
efforts, and we are committed to supporting independent Russian 
journalism and the access of Russian people to fair and 
independent media.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. Thank you for that. Let me 
just say to Ms. Kavalec, congratulations on your nomination. 
There are two people who I have had, you know, long term 
friendships with who are prior ambassadors to Romania, Al 
Moses, as well as a Jim Rosapepe, who is currently now a 
Maryland State Senator.
    So they both asked me to pass on their best wishes. And 
they are, of course, if you have not already, available for any 
conversations that you may have as you head off or after you 
arrive.
    Ms. Kavalec. Great. Thank you so much.
    Senator Van Hollen. And is--okay. All right, it looks like 
there are no further questions. Again, congratulations to all 
of you on your nominations. I look forward to supporting all of 
your nominations. And I think we are going to be turning to a 
new panel momentarily, but no reason for all of you to wait 
around for that.
    So, congratulations, and we will do our very best to have 
these votes as soon as possible. The hearing is adjourned.
    [Recess.]
    Senator Shaheen. Good afternoon. Congratulations to all of 
our nominees this afternoon. We are in the middle of votes, as 
I tried to explain to each of you, and so we expect Senators to 
come in and out. But in the interest of trying to move the 
panel along, I am going to go ahead and begin.
    And very pleased to introduce our nominees, Mr. Manuel 
Micaller to Tajikistan, Ms. Stephanie Sanders Sullivan to the 
African Union, Mr. Henry Jardine to the Republics of Mauritius 
and Seychelles.
    And the hearing will also review the nomination of Mr. 
Felice Gorordo to be Ambassador to the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development, and Mr. Richard Weiner to be 
Ambassador to the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development. So let me do brief introductions of each of you, 
and then we will ask you to give your opening statements.
    Manuel Micaller has been nominated to the position of 
Ambassador to Tajikistan. His Foreign Service career has been 
marked by distinguished service and depth of knowledge of 
Central Asia, including prior service in Dushanbe as Political 
Counselor and Acting Deputy Chief of Mission.
    More recently, he served as Deputy Chief of Mission at our 
embassies in Nepal and Mongolia. I am also pleased to see 
Stephanie Sanders Sullivan nominated to lead our Mission to the 
African Union.
    And she has worked on African issues in Washington and in 
the field for more than 20 of her 30 plus year distinguished 
career and is revered as a successful leader and manager by her 
State Department colleagues.
    Senator Menendez just joined us. He is the Chair of this 
committee. Senator Menendez, would you like to go ahead and do 
your introduction, and then I will continue with the remaining 
nominees.
    The Chairman. Well, thank you, Madam Chair, for conducting 
the previous panel and this panel. It is an important part of 
what we do in the Foreign Relations committee is reviewing the 
nominees for various positions, and we are pleased that our 
subcommittees and our ranking chairs and ranking members of our 
committees are willing to do so. So thank you very much for 
doing so.
    Congratulations to all of the nominees for their 
nominations. I am particularly here to introduce Felice 
Gorordo, a nominee to be the U.S. Alternate Executive Director 
of the World Bank.
    At a time when China is increasingly willing to use its 
economic power to pressure other nations to do its bidding, 
when Latin America is trying to recover from the economic 
impact of the COVID pandemic, when Putin's war in Ukraine 
threatens the food supply of developing nations around the 
world, strong, dependable leadership at the World Bank has 
never been more important.
    And Felice Gorordo has the experience, commitment, and 
vision of the United States that needs to tackle the challenges 
the World Bank faces today. His journey starts the way that 
mine did. He is the son of Cuban exiles who fled dictatorship 
in their country. His parents came to the United States in 
search of the American dream. His dad was in law enforcement. 
His mother was a teacher.
    And from then, Felice learned the value of public service. 
That is why Felicia found that Raizes de Esperanza, Roots of 
Hope, a nonprofit that empowers young people in Cuba through 
technology and entrepreneurship. It is why he worked for both 
the Bush and Obama Administrations, advancing the United States 
national interest, no matter which party was in the White 
House.
    At the same time, Felice has an impressive private sector 
experience. He has been CEO of three different equity 
investment ventures. Emerge Americas, a platform focused on 
transforming Miami into the tech hub of the Americas.
    Clearpath, a tech company focused on revolutionizing the 
paper based immigration filing process. And Libre, a venture 
backed mobility tech company with operations in the United 
States and Mexico.
    In the wake of COVID, his understanding of finance, 
economic statecraft, and technology will help the United States 
and its like-minded partners make the concerted push to prevent 
economic collapse in the developing world.
    He should be in this post because we need to make sure that 
China will not continue getting away with their malign 
influence at the institutions that we, the United States, 
created to shape the international order.
    And if confirmed to this post at the World Bank, Felice 
will advocate for our values, will stand up for democracy and 
human rights. So I urge my colleagues to support the nomination 
of Felice Gorordo for the post of U.S. Alternate Executive 
Director for the World Bank. I do not, as the chairman, very 
often come to introduce individuals.
    But, Felice, you certainly deserve. Thank you very much, 
Madam Chair.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you very much, Senator Menendez. And 
it is very true, he does not often come to introduce folks, so 
it is an honor. Let me continue with the remaining members of 
the panel and go to Henry Jardine, who is nominated to serve as 
Ambassador to the Republic of Mauritius and Seychelles.
    He has a strong record of leadership throughout his nearly 
30 year Foreign Service career, with service across four 
geographic regions in Washington, where he currently leads the 
State Department's Career Development and Assignments Office.
    Among his many leadership positions overseas, he served as 
Deputy Chief of Mission in Albania and Management Councilor at 
our Embassy in Thailand. Finally, I am pleased to introduce 
Richard Weiner, who is the nominee to represent the United 
States at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 
or the EBRD.
    Mr. Weiner is one of our leading international trade and 
investment lawyers and is qualified to practice law in both the 
European Union and the United States. As Senior Partner in the 
Washington and Brussels offices of the international law firm 
of Sidley Austin, he is a member of the law firm's global 
arbitration, trade, and advocacy group.
    He spent more than 30 years working on U.S., EU trade and 
investment policy and market access issues. So with that, I am 
going to ask Ms. Sullivan to begin with your opening statement.
    Senator Shaheen. Ms. Sullivan.

  STATEMENT OF HON. STEPHANIE SANDERS SULLIVAN OF MARYLAND, A 
 CAREER MEMBER OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF CAREER 
 MINISTER, NOMINATED TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED STATES 
 OF AMERICA TO THE AFRICAN UNION, WITH THE RANK AND STATUS OF 
          AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY

    Ms. Sullivan. Thank you for your kind introduction, Madam 
Chairperson, Ranking Member, and distinguished Members of the 
Foreign Relations committee. Thank you for this opportunity to 
appear before you today. I am honored to be the President's 
nominee for U.S. Ambassador to the African Union. I appreciate 
the trust and confidence President Biden and Secretary Blinken 
have in me.
    If confirmed, I pledge to work with you to advance our 
Nation's interests through our partnership with that key 
institution and its member states. I am joined by my husband, 
John, my pillar of support, who has accompanied me on each 
posting. Our sons, Dan and Scott are here from Maryland and New 
Jersey, respectively.
    From my first experience in Africa as a Peace Corps 
volunteer in the DRC, I have felt drawn to the charms and 
challenges of the continent and its people. I have spent two-
thirds of my 35 years of diplomatic service in Africa or 
working on African issues with postings in Cameroon, the 
Republic of Congo, Ghana, twice, and Washington, D.C.
    Throughout my career, I have teamed up with committed 
interagency colleagues to advance U.S. diplomatic, economic, 
and security interests. A two time Ambassador, I have visited 
33 African countries in all five regions on the continent.
    If confirmed as the seventh United States ambassador to the 
AU, I will be proud to represent our country, which has a 
sizable portion of Africa's sixth region, the diaspora. The AU 
brings together its member states to deliberate and act on the 
continent's most pressing issues and to establish standards by 
which all members can hold each other accountable.
    The U.S. Mission to the AU enhances our engagement with and 
our ability to understand the perspective of the AU Commission 
and the AU Member States. If confirmed, I will lead the 
talented U.S. AU team to advance the Administration's Africa 
strategy, in which the U.S. partnership with the AU plays a 
central role.
    The strategies mutually reinforcing objectives are to, one, 
foster openness and open societies. Two, deliver democratic and 
security dividends. Three, advance pandemic recovery and 
economic opportunity. And four, support conservation, climate 
adaptation, and adjust energy transition.
    We have long partnered with the AU on shared priorities, 
and the pathways of this strategy will support the AU's Agenda 
2063 for a more prosperous and peaceful continent and bolster 
the region's ability to solve global problems alongside the 
United States.
    First, democracy and accountable governance remain 
essential for peace, security, and sustained economic growth. 
Recent democratic backsliding in some places undermines the 
progress African countries have made toward inclusive 
development.
    If confirmed, I will reinforce our shared commitment to 
democratic principles and the rule of law, to include 
transparency, justice, free and fair elections with peaceful 
transfer of power, and respect for human rights.
    Second, fragility and ongoing conflicts in parts of Africa 
also threaten global and U.S. National Security. They hinder 
economic growth and enable violent extremism to spread. The AU 
has made significant strides to prevent, respond to, and 
resolve armed conflict, most recently in Ethiopia, and to 
counter transnational threats.
    If confirmed, I will maintain capacity building efforts to 
achieve a more secure continent where people and nations can 
reach their full potential. Third, the Africa Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention led the continent's effective 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic by mobilizing health 
ministers, coordinating a continental strategy, and 
establishing a platform to procure vaccines.
    The collaboration between Africa CDC and our own CDC, and 
other U.S. Government agencies, shaped our life saving support 
to the continent. If confirmed, I will continue our partnership 
with the AU to improve global security--global health security 
and strengthen African health systems.
    On the broader economic front, the African Continental Free 
Trade Area positions African governments to reduce tariff and 
non-tariff barriers, enhance regional integration, and increase 
trade and investment, to form a $3.4 trillion trading bloc of 
an estimated 1.3 billion people. When fully implemented, this 
economic bloc will be the fifth largest in the world.
    If confirmed, I will champion additional American private 
sector investment in the growing African market to promote 
mutual prosperity and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. 
Fourth, the United Nations recognizes Africa as the region most 
vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
    For example, four consecutive years of drought have created 
a food security crisis in the Horn of Africa that has been 
exacerbated by Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine. If 
confirmed, I will work closely with the AU on addressing the 
impacts of climate change and help support a just energy 
transition through programs like Power Africa.
    Madam Chairperson and members of the committee, ranking 
member, thank you again for today's hearing. I look forward to 
answering your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Sullivan follows:]


              Prepared Statement of Stephanie S. Sullivan

    Chairwoman Shaheen, Ranking Member Portman, distinguished members 
of the Foreign Relations Committee, thank you for this opportunity to 
appear before you today. I am honored to be the President's nominee for 
U.S. Ambassador to the African Union (AU). I appreciate the trust and 
confidence President Biden and Secretary Blinken have in me. If 
confirmed, I pledge to work with you to advance our nation's interests 
through our partnership with this key institution and its member 
states.
    This afternoon I'm joined by my husband John, a pillar of support

Mr. Jardine.

 STATEMENT OF HENRY V. JARDINE OF VIRGINIA, A CAREER MEMBER OF 
   THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-COUNSELOR, 
NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF 
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF MAURITIUS, AND 
 TO SERVE CONCURRENTLY AND WITHOUT ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION AS 
  AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED 
        STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF SEYCHELLES

    Mr. Jardine. Chairwoman Shaheen, Ranking Member, and 
members of the committee, I am honored to appear before this 
committee today as President Biden's nominee to be the next 
United States Ambassador to the Republic of Mauritius and the 
Republic of Seychelles.
    I am thankful for the trust that the President and 
Secretary Blinken have placed in me to nominate me for this 
role, and I consider it a privilege to represent the United 
States of America. My parents immigrated to this country from 
the United Kingdom in the 1950s.
    My father experienced a childhood of poverty in North 
Wales, and my mother, the devastating bombings, Nazi bombings 
of Liverpool. They understood the promise that the United 
States could offer, and from their example and experience comes 
my commitment of service to this country for over the past 30 
years in both the United States Army and Department of State.
    As a career member of the Senior Foreign Service with 
extensive work experience in the Indo-Pacific region on a range 
of policy and management issues, I have developed the skills 
that will allow me to strengthen our relationship with both 
countries.
    While my professional experience has prepared me for the 
opportunity to serve as Ambassador to Mauritius and the 
Seychelles, this is only possible with the great support of my 
wife, Kathleen Jardine, who is here with me today. She is 
presently a Fairfax County public teacher who was there as a 
partner through the long years, far from family and in some 
difficult circumstances.
    I also note with pride my son, Thomas, who, while 
experiencing many disruptions in his young life in education as 
a result of my career, is now a successful college student in 
the Netherlands. In just over 50 years, since gaining 
independence from the United Kingdom, Mauritius has achieved 
political stability through a commitment to democracy, 
establishment of a strong economy, and acceptance of ethnic 
diversity.
    Mauritius has shown the global community that it is a model 
both politically and economically for Africa, the Indian Ocean 
region, and beyond. The United States also enjoys a positive 
bilateral relationship with the Government of Seychelles, which 
in 2020 held free and fair elections and peacefully 
transitioned power to the opposition party for the first time 
since independence 46 years ago.
    We support Seychelles' efforts to solidify its democratic 
transition, support of regional peace, and to tackle climate 
change. Despite its high per capita income, Seychelles needs 
support to strengthen its financial system and anti-corruption 
regime. The United States is well-placed to provide assistance 
in these areas.
    Regional security is an important element of our bilateral 
relationship with both Mauritius and Seychelles, and I will 
seek additional ways we can partner to combat drug trafficking, 
transnational criminal activity, and illegal, unregulated, and 
unreported fishing in the Indian Ocean.
    Although the United States Embassy is located in Mauritius, 
I intend to travel to Seychelles frequently as we continue to 
focus on expanding our bilateral relationship. Democracy 
promotion continues to be an important element of our foreign 
policy in Africa. Both Mauritius and Seychelles are models for 
the rest of sub-Saharan Africa.
    The 2020 election in Seychelles showed the world that the 
Seychelles are fiercely committed to democracy. While the 
Mauritian general elections are set to take place in 2024, I 
would work with both countries to strengthen their democratic 
systems and to spread their examples elsewhere.
    Of course, while pursuing all these objectives, I would 
make protecting Americans living and traveling in both 
Mauritius and Seychelles my highest priority. Again, I am 
honored to be the next Ambassador--honored to be nominated to 
be the next Ambassador to Mauritius and Seychelles.
    And if confirmed, I look forward to working closely with 
you and other members of the committee. I look forward to your 
questions. Thank you.

  STATEMENT OF L. FELICE GORORDO OF FLORIDA, NOMINATED TO BE 
UNITED STATES ALTERNATE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT FOR A TERM OF TWO YEARS

    Mr. Gorordo. Good afternoon, Chair, Ranking Member, and 
distinguished members of the committee. I am humbled and 
honored to have been nominated by President Joe Biden to be the 
next United States Alternate Executive Director for the World 
Bank.
    I would also like to personally thank the chairman, 
Chairman Menendez, for his very kind and moving introduction, 
for which I am deeply grateful. I appreciate this opportunity 
to serve at such a critical time for both our Nation and the 
world. I want to recognize several important individuals in my 
life without whom this would not be possible and who are 
present here today.
    I would like to begin by thanking my wife of 13 years and 
my partner in all things for 19, Bianca Ferrer Gorordo, and our 
two children, David, who is here present, and Catalina, who I 
am sure is watching from home. I would also like to pause to 
recognize members of my family who are not here today, but who 
have played a pivotal role in my life.
    I am tremendously appreciative to my mother, Marta Serra 
Mohr, who was reunited with our creator seven years ago today. 
And to all my extended family for their love, sacrifice, and 
unwavering support throughout the years.
    As the chairman noted, I am the son of Cuban exiles who 
fled a communist revolution, risking it all and leaving 
everything behind in search of freedom, opportunity, and the 
American Dream. This great Nation received them with open arms 
and gave them a fighting chance to make a better life for 
themselves and their family.
    And for these reasons, we have always been indebted to our 
country and sought to pay it forward. The call to public 
service was instilled in me by my family and by my faith. My 
father, Francisco Gorordo, served as a police officer for more 
than 25 years, and my mother worked in education for over two 
decades.
    They nurtured in me a purpose driven resolve to ensure that 
we live up to the Gospel of Matthew Chapter 25, to feed the 
hungry, heal the sick, and welcome the stranger. My Jesuit 
education and upbringing further cultivated my vocation to 
service, taking part in humanitarian missions in Latin America 
during my high school years and then founding a non-
governmental organization while I was in college called Roots 
of Hope, which still exists today, and focuses on empowering 
Cuban youth to become the authors of their own futures.
    Following my graduation from Georgetown University, I 
proudly served in the U.S. Department of Commerce, State, and 
Homeland Security during the Administration of President George 
W. Bush. In 2011, I was appointed as a White House fellow by 
President Barack Obama and served in the White House Office of 
Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs, working with 
industry leaders on economic competitiveness programs.
    There, I developed and organized the first ever White House 
Conference on connecting the Americas, which included 
participation of business and government leaders from 
throughout the Americas in the lead up to the 2012 Summit of 
the Americas.
    In 2013, I returned home to Miami to pursue a career in 
entrepreneurship, and I served as CEO of three mission-driven 
technology companies as an investor and advisor of two venture 
capital funds with global mandates, one in health care and 
another in infrastructure.
    I believe this experience has prepared me to take on the 
important responsibilities that the President has nominated me 
for at the World Bank. The bank's mission is to end extreme 
poverty and promote shared prosperity in a sustainable way.
    Given Russia's unprovoked war in Ukraine, which has 
worsened food insecurity around the world, the prolonged global 
pandemic and the rising threat of authoritarian regimes like 
China, the bank remains a critically important institution to 
create sustainable and inclusive economic growth and resiliency 
for the most vulnerable, and to promote prosperity for people 
around the world.
    If confirmed, I will use my experience to help advance U.S. 
development, foreign policy, and National Security priorities, 
while also expanding markets for U.S. products and services. 
Drawing on my fiduciary experience as an investor, executive, 
and board member of both for profit and nonprofit companies, I 
am resolved to be a good steward of our tax dollars to ensure 
the bank's programs yield the greatest return on investment and 
uphold our values.
    I will also seek to engage with a diverse range of 
important stakeholders, including members of both parties, to 
ensure the interests of all Americans are represented in the 
bank's boardroom and projects.
    Moreover, I will draw on my two decades of experience in 
management and oversight to promote the greatest degree of 
integrity, transparency, and accountability in the bank's 
operations.
    As a first generation American whose family suffered at the 
hands of a communist totalitarian regime, I am deeply committed 
to honoring, protecting, and advancing the cause of democracy, 
human rights, and economic prosperity here and abroad.
    If confirmed, I will work relentlessly to uphold U.S. 
values and advance our interests around the world. Again, I am 
so grateful to you all for your consideration of my nomination, 
and I would be happy to answer your questions. Thank you.

                Prepared Statement of L. Felice Gorordo

the committee, I am humbled and honored to have been nominated by 
President Joe Biden to be the next United States Alternate Executive

Francisco Gorordo, my stepfather Charles Mohr, my step-mother Delvis

    The call to public service was instilled in me by my family and my 
faith. My father served as a police officer for more than 25 years, and 
my mother worked in education for over two decades. They nurtured in me 
a purpose-driven resolve to ensure that we live up to the Gospel of 
Matthew, Chapter 25: to feed the hungry, heal the sick, and welcome the 
stranger. My Jesuit education and upbringing further cultivated my 
vocation to service--taking part in humanitarian missions in Latin 
America during my high school years, and then founding a 
nongovernmental organization while I was in college called Roots of 
Hope, which still exists today and focuses on empowering Cuban youth to 
become the authors of their own futures.
    Following my graduation from Georgetown University, I proudly 
served in the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State, and Homeland 
Security during the Administration of President George W. Bush. In 
2011, I was appointed as a White House Fellow by President Barack Obama 
and served in the White House Office of Public Engagement & 
Intergovernmental Affairs, working with industry leaders on economic 
competitiveness programs. There, I developed and organized the first-
ever ``White House Conference on Connecting the Americas,'' which 
included the participation of business and government leaders from 
throughout the Americas in the lead up to the 2012 Summit of the 
Americas.
    In 2013, I returned home to Miami to pursue a career in 
entrepreneurship, serving as CEO of three mission-driven technology 
companies, and as an investor and advisor at two venture capital funds 
with global mandates, one in healthcare and another in infrastructure.
    I believe this experience has prepared me to take on the important 
responsibilities that the President has nominated me for at the World 
Bank.
    The Bank's mission is ``to end extreme poverty and promote shared 
prosperity in a sustainable way.'' Given Russia's unprovoked war in 
Ukraine which has worsened food insecurity around the world, the 
prolonged global pandemic, and the rising threat of authoritarian 
regimes like China, the Bank remains a critically important institution 
to create sustainable and inclusive economic growth and resiliency for 
the most vulnerable and to promote prosperity for people around the 
world.
    If confirmed, I will use my experience to help advance U.S. 
development, foreign policy and national security priorities, and 
expand markets for U.S. products and services. Drawing on my fiduciary 
experience as an investor, executive and board member of both for-
profit and nonprofit companies, I resolve to be a good steward of our 
tax dollars to ensure the Bank's programs yield the greatest return on 
investment and uphold our values. I will also seek to engage with a 
diverse range of important stakeholders, including Members of both 
parties, to ensure the interests of all Americans are represented in 
the Bank's boardroom and projects. Moreover, I will draw on my two 
decades of experience in management and oversight to promote the 
greatest degree of integrity, transparency, and accountability in the 
Bank's operations.
    As a first-generation American whose family suffered at the hands 
of a communist totalitarian regime, I am deeply committed to honoring, 
protecting, and advancing the cause of democracy, human rights, and 
economic prosperity here and abroad. If confirmed, I will work 
relentlessly to uphold U.S. values and advance our interests around the 
world.
    Again, I am so grateful to you all for your consideration of my 
nomination. I would be happy to answer your questions.
    Thank you.


    Senator Shaheen. Thank you very much. Mr. Weiner.

 STATEMENT OF RICHARD L.A. WEINER OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, 
NOMINATED TO BE UNITED STATES DIRECTOR OF THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR 
                 RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT

    Mr. Weiner. Thank you for your kind introduction, Madam 
Chair, Ranking Member, and distinguished members of the 
committee. I am honored to have been nominated by President 
Biden to be the U.S. Director of the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development and humbled to appear before you 
today.
    I wish to take a moment to recognize several individuals in 
my life, in particular my wife of 33 years, Joann Weiner, who 
seated behind me, herself a former U.S. Treasury Department Tax 
Economist and now Professor of Economics at George Washington 
University. Watching online are our three adult children, Josh, 
Steven, and Naomi, whose love sustains us both.
    I would also like to recognize family members who are not 
here today. My late parents, Professors Herbert and Dora B. 
Weiner, came to this country from Hitler's Europe and crafted 
distinguished academic careers, first in New York and then at 
UCLA. My father was born in Vienna and raised in London, coming 
to the United States as an immigrant in 1939. My mother was 
born in Germany and fled the Nazis, first to France, then 
Morocco, then Cuba, before entering America as a refugee in 
December 1942.
    My parents seized the enormous opportunity of this Nation, 
teaching my brothers Tim and Tony and me of America's 
greatness, but also of her essential goodness. Their memories 
are a blessing to all who knew them.
    My family's experience fueled my professional pursuits. I 
was educated at Harvard College, where I served as the Student 
Chairman of the John F. Kennedy Institute of Politics, the 
University of Cambridge and Columbia Law School. I clerked for 
an extraordinary Federal judge, the Honorable Barefoot Sanders, 
before entering private practice. For 35 years, I have worked 
on international trade, energy, environmental and investment 
issues, including the past 19 years as a partner in the 
Washington and Brussels offices of the international law firm 
Sidley Austin LLP. I am dual qualified as a lawyer in the 
European Union and the United States, and I have worked on 
U.S., European issues throughout my career, including 10 years 
resident in Brussels, where I was the founding managing partner 
of Sidley's Brussels office.
    I hope to use my personal and professional background as a 
foundation for taking on the important responsibilities of U.S. 
Director of the EBRD at this critical time.
    As members of the committee know, the EBRD was formed after 
the collapse of Soviet communism to promote open markets and 
private entrepreneurship in Central and Eastern Europe, and in 
turn to promote stability, democracy, and the rule of law.
    Pursuit of these goals advances America's political and 
economic interests in foreign policy, National Security, 
diplomacy, development, and commerce.
    Overall, the Bank has done a commendable job advancing 
market transitions, improving the business climate, and 
promoting private sector solutions in emerging economies in 
Europe, Eurasia, the Middle East, and North Africa.
    The Bank is unique among development banks in having a 
political mandate, to promote democracy, the rule of law, and 
democratic institutions. A clear eyed assessment would suggest 
that its results in this area have been uneven. Should I be 
confirmed, I look forward to harnessing the comparative 
advantages of the EBRD to help rebuild Ukraine, wean Europe off 
Russian fossil fuels, green the economy of borrower nations, 
and promote democracy and democratic institutions in accordance 
with the Bank's Charter.
    Nowhere is the Bank's role more vital than in Ukraine and 
other frontline states fighting to resist Russia's unprovoked 
aggressions. The Bank has played and will play a vital role in 
sustaining national economies in the region and addressing 
immediate needs, such as food and energy security. The Bank has 
taken important steps via loan deferral, liquidity support, and 
trade financing, and Congress appropriated an additional $500 
million to the Bank in its second Ukraine supplemental this 
May.
    Over the longer term, the Bank will help Ukraine in 
reconstruction, including rebuilding infrastructure, 
revitalizing the engines of economic growth, binding the wounds 
of its people, and fostering private sector job creation.
    Nearly a century ago, my grandfather fled instability and 
antisemitism in Central Europe to work as a banker in London. 
It is an extraordinary testament to history's arc that I may 
have the honor to return there now to promote American values 
in the region.
    I am grateful for your consideration, and I would be 
delighted to answer your questions. Thank you.

    Mr. Micaller. That is correct.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you.

 STATEMENT OF MANUEL P. MICALLER, JR. OF CALIFORNIA, A CAREER 
    MEMBER OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-
    COUNSELOR, NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND 
PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC 
                         OF TAJIKISTAN

    Mr. Micaller. Chairwoman Shaheen, Ranking Member Portman, 
distinguished members, it is an honor to appear before you as 
the President's nominee to be the next U.S. Ambassador to the 
Republic of Tajikistan.
    I am grateful to be joined today by my dear mother, Monina 
Micaller, and I want to acknowledge my brother Jose, who is 
watching from home in San Francisco. Both have supported me 
throughout my Foreign Service career, and I would like to take 
this opportunity before the Senate to recognize and honor my 
late father, Manuel Micaller Senior, who inspired and 
encouraged me to embark on this journey of service to our great 
country.
    If confirmed, I will return to Central Asia, where I began 
my career in 1996 at the U.S. Embassy in Turkmenistan. I was 
drawn to this region, having studied the former Soviet Union, 
and I keep returning because of the critical importance it 
plays in our National Security and the opportunity to use my 
experience in a challenging environment to advance our shared 
interests.
    Tajikistan is a fascinating country, rich in culture and 
long at the crossroads of history. Bordering Afghanistan and 
China and exposed to Russian influence, Tajikistan is seeking 
to diversify its foreign partners, and the United States has 
proven itself as a reliable partner over the course of our 30 
year diplomatic relationship.
    Today, we have an opportunity to strengthen this 
relationship by easing economic and food insecurity caused by 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and by helping Tajikistan to 
diversify away from PRC investments.
    Tajikistan is balancing between a cautious generation that 
experienced the brutal civil war and a younger generation that 
is keen to advocate for itself and address challenges. We can 
seize this critical moment by building people to people 
connections.
    Tajikistan is an increasingly important security partner 
and has long been a key partner in supporting Afghanistan's 
stability. If confirmed, I will prioritize bilateral and 
regional security cooperation.
    I will also not hesitate to urge the Government to 
strengthen rule of law, demonstrate accountability in 
government--governance, protect freedom of expression, 
including for the press, and uphold the rights of minority and 
marginalized groups, including persons with disabilities, 
women, and religious and ethnic minorities.
    I will stress how addressing human rights can benefit 
Tajikistan's economic and security goals by attracting 
investment and preventing the radicalization of potential 
terrorists. If confirmed, I will work to expand and deepen our 
economic efforts with Tajikistan by supporting initiatives that 
develop accountable business practices and transparent 
institutions, improve the investment climate, reduce 
corruption, and create an equitable business environment.
    Tajikistan is eager to become a regional leader on 
addressing environmental challenges, so there are tremendous 
opportunities for enhanced partnership that can ultimately lead 
to a more prosperous Tajikistan.
    Protecting Americans abroad is the State Department's most 
important responsibility. If confirmed, I will endeavor to 
ensure the safety and health of our Embassy team, as well as of 
all American citizens in Tajikistan. The diversity of our staff 
is our greatest strength.
    I remain committed to an inclusive work environment 
consistent with the Biden Administration's and this committee's 
vision of a State Department workforce culture that values 
collegiality, teamwork, and respect.
    In closing, Madam Chair, Ranking Member, members of the 
committee, our goal is a stable, secure, sovereign, and 
prosperous Tajikistan. If confirmed, I will seek to strengthen 
our bilateral security, reinforce people to people and economic 
ties, and promote the democratic values we share.
    I pledge to work closely with you to strengthen the United 
States' strategic partnership with Tajikistan. I appreciate the 
opportunity to speak with you today, and I welcome your 
questions. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Micaller follows:]


               Prepared Statement for Manuel P. Micaller

    Chairwoman Shaheen, Ranking Member Portman, distinguished members 
of this committee, it is an honor to appear before you today as the 
President's nominee to be the next U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of 
Tajikistan.
    I am grateful to be joined today by my mother, Monina Micaller, and 
I want to acknowledge my brother, Jose Micaller, who is watching from 
home in San Francisco. Both have supported me throughout my Foreign 
Service career. And I would like to take this opportunity before the 
Senate to recognize and honor my late father, Manuel Micaller, Sr., who 
inspired and encouraged me to embark on this journey of service to our 
great country.
    If confirmed, I will return to Central Asia, where I began my 
career in 1996 as Vice Consul at the U.S. Embassy in Turkmenistan and 
later served as Political-Economic Chief in Tajikistan. I was drawn to 
this region having studied the former Soviet Union in college, and I 
keep returning because of the critical importance it plays in our 
national security and the opportunity to use my experience in a 
challenging environment to advance our shared interests.
    Tajikistan is a fascinating country, rich in history and culture. 
It has long been at the crossroads of history, and so it is again with 
the significant global shifts of recent years. With an 843-mile border 
with Afghanistan, a 280-mile border with China, and exposure to Russian 
influence, Tajikistan is seeking to diversify its foreign partners 
beyond its immediate neighbors. Despite the unique challenges presented 
by Tajikistan's neighborhood and our geographic distance, the United 
States has proven itself as a reliable partner over the course of our 
30-year diplomatic relationship. Today we have an opportunity to 
strengthen this relationship by easing economic and food insecurity 
caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and by helping Tajikistan's 
economy to diversify away from PRC investments.
    The only Central Asian country to experience a civil war after the 
fall of the Soviet Union, Tajikistan is confronting generational 
dynamics as it balances between a cautious generation that experienced 
the brutal 1992-1997 civil war and a younger generation that is keen to 
advocate for itself and address upcoming challenges. We can seize this 
critical time in generational discussions by using our public diplomacy 
work to build people-to-people connections that will benefit 
individuals and civil society for decades to come. Tajikistan has 
become an increasingly important strategic security partner and has 
long been a key partner in supporting Afghanistan's stability. We 
welcome the growing relationship on counterterrorism and border 
security efforts and continue to carefully consider how to partner with 
Tajikistan to implement programs and train security and law enforcement 
officers in accordance with international human rights standards. If 
confirmed, I will prioritize bilateral and regional security 
cooperation.
    As a previous Political Chief in Dushanbe, I understand how 
delicate discussions about human rights can be with the Government of 
Tajikistan. I will not hesitate to urge the Government to strengthen 
the rule of law, institute fair legal processes and institutions, 
demonstrate accountability in governance, protect the freedom of 
expression--including for the press--and uphold the rights of minority 
and marginalized groups, including persons with disabilities, women, 
and religious and ethnic minorities. I will stress how addressing human 
rights can benefit Tajikistan's most pressing economic and security 
goals by attracting foreign direct investment and preventing the 
radicalization of potential terrorists.
    If confirmed, I will work to expand and deepen our economic efforts 
with the Government of Tajikistan by supporting the already significant 
initiatives that develop accountable business practices and transparent 
institutions, strengthen Tajikistan's banking system, improve the 
investment climate, reduce corruption, and create an equitable business 
environment. Tajikistan is eager to become a regional leader on 
addressing water-related environmental challenges. In both economic and 
environmental areas of cooperation, there are tremendous opportunities 
for enhanced partnership that can ultimately lead to a more prosperous 
Tajikistan.
    Protecting Americans abroad is the State Department's most 
important responsibility. If confirmed, I will endeavor to ensure the 
safety and health of my Embassy team, as well as all American citizens 
in Tajikistan.
    None of this critical work can be accomplished without our 
dedicated Locally Engaged Staff, Eligible Family Members, and Foreign 
Service Officers. The diversity of our staff is our greatest strength. 
I remain committed to an inclusive work environment, consistent with 
the Biden administration's and this committee's vision of a State 
Department workforce culture that values collegiality, teamwork, and 
respect.
    In closing, Madam Chair, Ranking Member, members of the committee, 
I understand our goal is a stable and prosperous Tajikistan that is 
free to pursue political, economic, and security interests on its own 
terms. If confirmed, I will seek to strengthen our bilateral security, 
reinforce people-to-people and economic ties, and promote the 
democratic values we share.
    I pledge to work closely with you to strengthen the United States' 
strategic partnership with Tajikistan. I appreciate the opportunity to 
speak with you today. I welcome your questions.


    Senator Shaheen. Thank you very much. Thank you to each of 
you. I am going to now turn it over to Senator Hagerty while I 
go vote, and I shall return shortly.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Senator Shaheen. And I will see 
you shortly too and we will get this voting underway. I hope 
you will understand and appreciate some of the complexities of 
navigating these hearings in the afternoon when we have votes 
ongoing. I would like to first and foremost congratulate all of 
you for being here today.
    In your various roles, you will have the opportunity to 
represent the most exceptional Nation in the world, and I 
cannot think of a higher honor than the ones that you have been 
nominated for.
    So my deep congratulations to you and my deep appreciation 
to all of your families for the support that they will give you 
in hopes of being very successful in the roles that you will 
fulfill, if you are confirmed.
    To our career Foreign Service Officers, I want to thank you 
for your service. It has been my pleasure to have the 
opportunity to work closely with many of you, and I appreciate 
what you and your families have done for our Nation.
    And then for Mr. Gorordo and Mr. Weiner, I want to 
congratulate you and welcome you to a new world. A little bit 
less so for you, Mr. Gorordo, because I understand you were a 
White House fellow, as was I.
    A few years after I was, I might say. But congratulations 
on that. I think that service probably served as an inspiration 
for you to be sitting here today, so I am very pleased to see 
you here. And Mr. Weiner, it is great to see you.
    Our mutual friend, Tennessean, Alice Randall, who is a 
professor at my alma mater, Vanderbilt, was kind enough to 
introduce us, and I appreciate the conversations that we have 
had.
    We touched on this somewhat, but I would like to come back 
to our conversations, particularly with respect to the 
challenge that you will be facing as Ukraine is to be rebuilt 
in a number of areas that will be a matter of focus.
    I would like to get your perspective on your top priorities 
as you investigate and pursue that challenge.
    Mr. Weiner. Well, Senator, thank you very much for the kind 
introduction and for being so gracious as to spend time with me 
before Thanksgiving. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate 
it.
    It is hard to find words sufficient to condemn Russia's 
unprovoked attacks on Ukraine.
    Besides, the tens of thousands killed and wounded, Russia's 
targeting of civilians, its destruction of utilities, oil, gas, 
and water, its bombardment of hospitals and apartment blocks 
are absolutely grotesque. And we have seen, at the economic 
level, if I can limit discussion there, a third of the 
population estimated to have been displaced, and GDP falling 35 
percent approximately.
    We thought we had seen the end of land wars in Europe, but 
obviously that is not the case. And the United States to-date 
has been the leader in security assistance to Ukraine and in 
economic aid to the country.
    Before the war, Ukraine was already the third largest 
client of the EBRD. The EBRD has had more than 500 projects in 
Ukraine and has invested more than =5 billion to date in the 
country. Since the war, since the wintertime, the Bank has 
established a special support fund for grants and risk sharing, 
approximately =3 billion of commitments through the end of next 
year, of which the Congress has appropriated $500 million 
through the second Ukraine supplemental in May.
    The focus of this support fund is really in five areas, 
food, security, energy security, infrastructure, trade 
facilitation, and medicines and pharmaceuticals. So that is the 
initial focus of the EBRD.
    Over the longer term, of course, we look towards the relief 
efforts phasing into reconstruction, phasing into 
modernization, and ultimately into EU accession, which will 
look something like the Marshall Plan, but it will be different 
in very important respects. There will be more than one donor. 
There will be one primary recipient instead of 16. And of 
course, unlike 1945, the shooting may not have stopped or may 
not have stopped in all of Ukraine, and therefore, it is a 
unique situation. Each of these steps will overlap. And it 
requires several things which you, and given your private-
sector expertise, and given your tenure as Ambassador in Japan, 
understand very well.
    We have got to find a way to pool political risk. We have 
got to find a way to provide insurance coverage that will bring 
the private sector in. And we need to rethink how force majeure 
provisions will be provided.
    I have gone on too long, but let me just mention one other 
thing, oversight is critical.
    Accountability is critical. Transparency is critical. We 
have got to make sure the money is spent for its intended uses. 
Ukraine historically is considered as the third most corrupt 
country in Europe, and we have got to make sure that high 
integrity standards are applied to American taxpayers' dollars 
spent in support of Ukraine.
    Senator Hagerty. I have utmost appreciation for the final 
point that you made and a great deal of concern, given the 
amount of taxpayer money that the United States Government has 
already committed and the lack of clarity that we have at this 
point in terms of where those funds are directed.
    If I could come back again to the role of the bank, and 
specifically comment on a point of concern that I have. And I 
am going to stay with you for just a moment, Mr. Weiner. This 
is on the bank's website. The bank, ``is aligned with some of 
the stated objectives of the Belt and Road Initiative of 
China.''
    And it is something that I think we need to look at. Back 
in June of last year, National Security Adviser Sullivan said 
that the United States is, along with like-minded countries in 
the G-7, should be looking to embrace alternatives to the Belt 
and Road Initiative. I could not agree with that statement 
more.
    And I am very concerned about the abuse of debt trap 
financing and the predatory practices that the CCP uses in the 
Belt and Road Initiative all around the world. I am also very 
concerned about China's continued support for Russia in the 
face of their invasion of Ukraine.
    So I am going to ask you about your position on the 
European banks' continued cooperation on projects that are 
associated with communist China's Belt and Road Initiative.
    Mr. Weiner. Senator, thank you for that very important 
question. It is no question that confronting China is perhaps 
the essential U.S. foreign policy challenge of the 21st 
century. Let me take the question, if I may, in two parts.
    The first is that China is not a client of the Bank. It 
does not receive loans from the EBRD. It is a shareholder, but 
its shareholding is less than 1/10th of 1 percent of total 
shares. I believe the correct number is 0.097 percent.
    Put differently, the United States with a 10 percent 
shareholding has it more than 100 times the say of China in 
terms of the Bank's operations.
    Now, that is not fully responsive to your question. China 
is a malign actor. And as Congress and the Administration have 
made very clear, we are in competition with China's form of 
economic statecraft: the use of state-owned enterprises, unfair 
trade practices, theft of technology, forced labor, 
environmental degradation, the list goes on from there.
    The EBRD is essential to the United States and its allies 
in confronting Chinese reach in the 37 client countries of the 
EBRD. We have to offer an alternative to Chinese financing. It 
is an opportunity for us to project a Western power.
    And we have got to make sure, as an example and we talked 
about this the other day and I was grateful for your comments, 
we have to make sure that the lifecycle costs of projects do 
not allow the Chinese to offer low standards and cheap 
construction at the inflated prices that we have seen.
    As you have mentioned and correctly so, it is essential 
that we provide an alternative that is the opposite of the 
Chinese model. And there, if I may, one other comment. When we 
talked the other day, you mentioned JBIC, and I would be very 
grateful if we had the opportunity to get your expertise with 
respect to JBIC and similar Asian institutions in terms of 
their role in supporting what the EBRD and similar institutions 
are doing to confront China in Central Asia and elsewhere.
    Senator Hagerty. I think that could be very helpful because 
Japan has taken an increasingly greater interest in what is 
happening, particularly in the wake of the attack on Ukraine by 
Russia. They have been attending NATO meetings. They are much 
more focused, I think, on the region broadly today.
    And I do believe that there is great opportunity, as you 
and I discussed, and I am more than happy to facilitate that. 
Mr. Gorordo, I do not want to miss the opportunity to get your 
perspective on China's role with the bank, and your perspective 
on how you would handle and manage the relationship, in path 
with the United States.
    Mr. Gorordo. Well, first of all, thank you, Senator. And 
thank you for your kind words about my previous service and our 
shared affinity for the White House fellowship, which was 
undoubtedly a transformative experience for me personally, and 
very much which has helped cultivate in me a calling for public 
service.
    And so in the spirit of the fellowship, I have seek to, in 
this new role, if confirmed, pay it forward and take to heart 
all that has been invested in my time as a fellow and in my 
great appreciation for this country and what it has done for my 
family.
    I would like to echo the sentiments of Mr. Weiner and 
associate myself with his comments, especially with regards to 
China and its role as a malign actor. There is no question, as 
the Secretary of the Treasury and Deputy Secretary have said, 
we are in a strategic competition with China.
    And there is no doubt, and I have seen it firsthand in 
Latin America, operating there previously, how it acts in an 
adversarial way as it tries to steal our intellectual property 
and undermine American values every chance it gets.
    So for those reasons, I would push--I would ensure that we 
push back and outcompete China at every chance that we get. My 
understanding is that in 2018, as part of the capital increase 
of the bank, the bank made certain commitments about graduating 
companies--countries that meet the criteria for graduation.
    My understanding is that China, because of its high per 
capita income, its own institutional capacity, as well as its 
access to other alternative forms of financing, has met that 
criteria.
    And so I would use the voice and vote of the U.S. 
Government to ensure that we push China to graduate from the 
World Bank.
    Senator Hagerty. Let us stay on--welcome, Madam Chairman. I 
was trying to keep a conversation going while you were----
    Senator Shaheen. And you did a very nice job. Thank you.
    Senator Hagerty. I will turn the gavel back to you.
    Senator Shaheen. Okay. Well, thank you very much, Senator 
Haggerty. I am--I will try not to repeat your questions, 
although certainly on China and the World Bank, I guess I do 
want to follow up. And forgive me if you have already responded 
to this--but, as soon as I can find it.
    So I know that Senator Hagerty was asking about the World 
Bank's engagement with China, and Chinese firms have received 
$52 billion out of the $280 billion of outstanding World Bank 
contracts. And at the same time, state-owned Chinese firms have 
been debarred for violating procurement policies.
    So, can you talk about how we should be addressing this 
challenge? And is the World Bank's reliance on Chinese firms 
problematic? And what can we do to address that? And also, can 
you speak to whether we should support a suspension of Russia's 
membership from the World Bank?
    Mr. Gorordo. Well, first of all, thank you, Senator, for 
your question. This is actually a question that is very near 
and dear to my heart. I first started working with our 
multilateral development banks when I worked at the Department 
of Commerce and worked with our commercial service liaisons at 
the various MDBs, including the World Bank.
    Specifically working with them to help American companies 
be able to win procurement opportunities. And so it would be a 
priority of mine, if confirmed, to help our American companies 
get a fair share of the contracts that they are competing for, 
level the playing field, and expand U.S. markets for U.S. 
products and services.
    With regards to China, as I stated with Senator Hagerty, 
there is no question that we are in a strategic competition 
with China, and that when it is looking to undercut our values 
or steal our intellectual property, that it is acting in an 
adversarial way.
    Moreover, with regards to procurement opportunities, and 
specifically, I would advocate for a greater focus, an emphasis 
on lifetime costs and lifecycle costs, as well as value for 
cost versus the lowest bid, which is how often times China wins 
its contracts.
    Lastly, I would push for resourcing the World Bank's 
integrity unit to ensure that we are combating corruption 
everywhere, and specifically also in our procurement. With 
regards to Russia, I would like, as I stated in the record, to 
condemn Russia for its illegal and unprovoked war in Ukraine.
    There is no question that in the bank right now since--the 
bank has ceased operations rather in Russia and also ceased all 
projects in Russia, that Russia is isolated. And so I would 
work very closely with our allies and build a coalition to 
ensure that we further isolate Russia.
    And I am happy, if confirmed, to work with my colleagues to 
get an answer to your question with regards to the suspension.
    Senator Shaheen. And when you talked about focusing on some 
of the other areas that are important other than just the 
lowest bid for Chinese firms, is there support among other--
among the international community and other colleagues at the 
bank to put in place those kinds of criteria for making 
determinations on loans?
    Mr. Gorordo. Well, Senator, thank you for your follow up 
question. With regards, you know, to the specifics of those 
details, given that I am not in the Administration, not yet 
confirmed, I cannot speak to those details of the bank's 
management and other executive directors.
    But what I can say that I will commit myself wholeheartedly 
to work, to build coalition with our allies, to be able to 
advance our values and our interests, especially in this 
regard.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you. Mr. Weiner, staying on 
international finance, I want to ask you to explore a little 
bit more about the importance of the EBRD to rebuilding Ukraine 
after the war and the kinds of initiatives that you think could 
be supported by the European community.
    Mr. Weiner. Well, thank you very much for your question, 
Senator. The rebuilding of Ukraine, the efforts that have begun 
or at least are being thought about today, really have four 
stages to them.
    There is the relief phase which we are in now, efforts then 
ultimately to rebuild and modernize, and then ready Ukraine for 
accession to the European Union. It will be a form of Marshall 
Plan, but that really does not do it justice because the 
fighting may not have stopped.
    Also, there will be multiple donors, not just one, and 
there will be one principal target, not to minimize the needs 
of the other frontline states, but the principal target will be 
Ukraine itself, not 16 countries as it was in the post-World 
War II period.
    It is absolutely critical that the multiple donors that 
commit to funding Ukrainian reconstruction actually step up, 
that there be burden sharing. The commitments that have been 
made by the EU, since that is your specific question, as I 
understand it, and of course, like the others on this panel, I 
am not yet in a position to speak in terms of the 
Administration's understanding, but my understanding is that 
those commitments have not yet been lived up to.
    There is a shortfall with respect to Ukraine. And that is 
not acceptable. It cannot be acceptable as we talk about the 
rebuilding in a very different sort of way, because the 
shooting may not have stopped. We may be talking about 
rebuilding in certain parts of the country or certain sectors 
of the economy, and that it may not be uni-directional, it will 
not be uni-dimensional. It will be different.
    As part of that process, accountability, transparency, 
oversight, return on investment are absolutely critical because 
if the money is not wisely spent, if we cannot account for the 
money, there will not be a next tranche, and no one interested 
in the future of Ukraine should be willing to accept that 
result, including the Ukrainians, of course, themselves.
    One other point, as we get closer to European Union 
accession, historically, the European Commission and the member 
states, the European Investment Bank, and others have funded 
that process. They did it for every other member state seeking 
accession as they figured out how to accept the acquis 
communautaire in their laws and worked on infrastructure and so 
on that met European standards, there is no reason that should 
not happen in this case as well.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you. I appreciate that. I especially 
appreciate the accountability piece because I think there will 
be more and more focus on that as time goes on. Another area of 
Europe that I think, that is of great concern to me is what is 
happening in the Western Balkans.
    It is a part of Europe that I think we have taken our eyes 
off of after the end of the conflict that followed the breakup 
of Yugoslavia, and we are seeing the results of not keeping a 
focus on what is happening there. And one of the biggest 
challenges, of course, is the economy in countries like Bosnia 
and Herzegovina.
    So can you talk about what kind of avenues the EBRD might 
explore to help countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina?
    Mr. Weiner. Senator, thank you. That is a very, very 
important question, and thank you for posing it. And I also 
wanted to welcome your leadership on this issue, and 
particularly the legislation you introduced in the summer, with 
respect to the Western Balkans.
    The EBRD has played a key role in the Western Balkans, in 
the six nations of the Western Balkans, through its financing, 
its policy engagement, and through hosting of regional summit 
meetings there to promote regional integration and to advance 
the Western Balkans as an attractive investment destination.
    And both of those are needed to maintain the region's 
stability. Pursuant to the EBRD's investment plan to advance 
regional integration, the Bank has invested more than =15 
billion in the region, and it is investing more than =1 billion 
a year. That is more than any other multilateral development 
bank. And it shows again that an institution like the EBRD can 
have a big voice in small nations.
    The key focus of the Bank's operations has been to build 
connective tissue. I use that phrase both talking about 
infrastructure, the building of highways that link the 
countries, but also in terms of setting up a registry for 
businesses in the region. 1.5 million businesses are linked 
together in a way to help facilitate their cooperation.
    The Bank has placed its emphasis in four areas where I 
think historically it has done very well: policy reform and 
good governance; investment in the private sector, which is the 
Bank's focus, and particularly in small- and medium-sized 
enterprises; the green economy transition, to use their 
parlance, including an issue that was very important to you, 
which is curbing ties to Russian fossil fuels; and trying to 
overcome the digital divide and help forge e digital 
transformation in these six countries, particularly to help 
youth and to help women.
    And on that point, let me just say that as the son, the 
husband, and the father of professional women, the issue of 
women's empowerment is of critical importance to me, and I 
would welcome the opportunity to work with you and your staff 
on those issues, should I be fortunate enough to be confirmed.
    Senator Shaheen. Well, thank you. I am sure we will take 
you up on that, should you be confirmed. Ms. Sanders Sullivan, 
one of the developments that I have found quite concerning as a 
result of Russia's war on Ukraine has been what that has meant 
to the availability of food for African countries.
    And what is even more concerning is not just that the food 
is not available because of the blockade of the Black Sea. 
Although, and I appreciate Turkey's help in trying to negotiate 
some ships to get that grain out of Ukraine, but it is really 
the disinformation that Russia has spread in Africa that says 
that it is the United States that is at fault, not Russia's war 
on Ukraine.
    Can you talk about the kinds of things that we might be 
doing and should be doing with the African Union to help 
correct that misinformation or disinformation because I think 
it is deliberate, in a way that addresses the responsibility 
for what is really happening with the food stocks?
    Ms. Sullivan. Senator, thank you very much for raising this 
important point. The disinformation has become on steroids.
    There has always been disinformation, but I think the ready 
availability of all the social media and the speed with which 
it circulates around the globe is unprecedented, and I think we 
do need to do a better job of not just getting our story out in 
a very traditional way, but also developing new tools where we 
can meet this disinformation on the battlefield.
    Interestingly, this week, Merriam-Webster dictionary 
announced that the word of the year was gaslighting. And if 
confirmed, I pledge to take that on in a way that not only 
tells our story about the good things that we are doing with 
the future, with working with African partners on a just energy 
transition, working on amplifying the availability of 
fertilizer, and also on the food and agriculture piece, working 
to address the root causes as well as the real time 
humanitarian crises that have been exacerbated certainly by 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but also the climate issue.
    So all of these are intertwined. There is no one answer to 
it, but we do have our global engagement center. If confirmed, 
I would work with my team to figure out ways that we might 
tackle that, not just, you know, at the level of the African 
Union, but there are no more borders when it comes to 
information these days and figuring out a way to get our story 
out there and straighten out the disinformation that is 
circulating. So thank you for the question.
    Senator Shaheen. Well, thank you. I think that this is an 
issue that is also about how do we better coordinate our 
messages across various agencies of the United States. So 
USAID, State, all of the efforts that we have, DOD, because we 
do not--we are not always talking with the same message in a 
way that I think would be important as we try and counter the 
disinformation that is out there.
    So, I appreciate your response. Mr. Jardine, I had the 
opportunity a number of years ago to meet with the former 
President of Mauritius. And one of the things that really 
struck me, it was at a time when we were trying to do some work 
in Africa to address the peaceful transition of power.
    And he had a very impressive story to tell about Mauritius' 
ability to better transition than most African countries. Why 
do you think that is and what do you think--can you assess the 
current governance in both Mauritius and Seychelles and how it 
compares?
    Mr. Jardine. Madam Chairwoman, thank you. Thank you very 
much for the opportunity to answer the question about democracy 
in Mauritius, why it has experienced successful democratic 
system, and similarly the experiences that are ongoing in 
Seychelles.
    Again, I think both countries, as you noted, do represent 
potential models for sub-Saharan Africa because of the success 
they have had. I think it is hard to characterize why, you 
know, some countries are more successful than others. I think 
in the case of Mauritius, one, has been, you know, focus on 
education, which is critical.
    It is not a large population, so there is a sense of 
community. I think that is helpful. In addition, I think there 
is a strong sense of family and stability within the community, 
and there is also the historical traditions of parliamentary 
democracy that they inherited. But again, in some cases, it may 
be hard to just assess any one country and its unique 
development. And sometimes there is also an element of luck I 
would have to say.
    In the context of Seychelles, also similar situation in 
which it gained independence from the United Kingdom. Small, 
you know, small population, a fairly close community, however 
it experienced a period of single party state, a coup d'etat in 
1977, and which essentially suppressed or stopped the 
democratic progress.
    However, more recently, they have had a very successful 
transition, democratic elections and a transition to an 
opposition party, as I mentioned, just in 2020. So again, I 
think it is very encouraging that they--that in Seychelles, 
that they are seeing sort of a path forward and consolidating 
the success of head on democracy.
    And again, I think from the United States position, we want 
to try to encourage others to look at Mauritius and Seychelles 
as a model and to see if those countries can assist. I know 
they are very engaged within the context of the African Union 
and see that membership as very important.
    And so I would hope that through that forum, that they 
would be able to again exchange and develop that perspective on 
democracy within the context of that multilateral organization.
    Again, if confirmed, that would be one area that I want to 
continue to focus on extensively, which is promoting the 
democratic progress that those two countries have experienced.
    I think the key approach would be to engage broadly, 
inclusively, and to reach a whole cross-section of the 
community in both islands, both republics. Thank you, Madam 
Chair. Madam Chair, I hope I answered your question.
    Senator Shaheen. Yes, that is helpful. Thank you. Senator 
Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Thanks, Madam Chairman. Mr. Gorordo, 
the--I want to talk about energy. Global philanthropist Bill 
Gates explains that ``increasing access to electricity is 
critical to lifting the world's poor out of poverty,'' 
something about which we can agree.
    For the first time in decades, the number of people around 
the world without access to electricity is actually set to rise 
in 2022. That means about 775 million people living without 
electricity.
    Due to inflation, the energy crisis, failed development 
policies, these people are struggling to safely and reliably 
cook and heat their homes. In fact, nearly 3 billion people 
today on this globe today rely on wood and waste for household 
energy.
    People living in poor and developing nations want and need 
a stable energy supply. They are looking for power generation 
that provides energy security. It helps create jobs and 
improves their lives.
    While traditional fuels are a vital tool for escaping 
poverty, they always have been, yet over the past few years, 
the World Bank has been imposing restrictions on the financing 
of traditional energy projects. It is a policy decision. It is 
critical that the World Bank immediately lift these harmful 
restrictions that are hurting people around the globe, people 
that they claim to be helping.
    To achieve its mission, the World Bank must embrace, not 
exclude, affordable energy resources. Ultimately, the solution 
to energy poverty does not lie in limiting options, but in 
using all available options for people in need.
    So if confirmed, will you commit to ensuring the World Bank 
is promoting all forms of energy projects across the globe, 
including oil, natural gas, and coal?
    Mr. Gorordo. Senator, first of all, thank you for that 
question. I actually cut my teeth in the private sector working 
in the energy sector and continue through my work at a private 
equity fund focused on infrastructure working in this sector. 
So this is a question very near and dear to my heart.
    With regards to the specifics of the current, you know, 
bank and its policies and programs, obviously I am not 
confirmed yet and not in the Administration so I cannot speak 
to those details, but my understanding is Deputy Secretary of 
Treasury has said it is vitally important for the U.S. and our 
allies to take steps to ensure that developing countries have 
the resources they need for public health and economic 
recovery, especially during this very difficult time after the 
pandemic.
    And so, if confirmed, I will work with Treasury and bank 
staff to support the most vulnerable countries and ensure that 
these countries have access to the tools needed to mitigate and 
adapt to the impact of climate change, as well as to have the 
energy that they need to be able to promote their own 
economies, and to balance the short term and long term needs of 
their development.
    In addition to that, I commit myself to evaluating each 
project on its own merits and aligned with the country's 
strategy and needs, according to the bank and U.S. regulations 
and Treasury guidance from my colleagues at Treasury, to ensure 
that we are upholding the highest standards.
    Senator Barrasso. And given that you are not confirmed yet 
and will consult with the folks from Treasury, the U.S. 
Department of Treasury announced plans to end support for 
fossil fuels at multilateral development banks.
    They said, except for exceptional circumstances. So to me, 
I want to know your opinion. What are exceptional circumstances 
in which the United States would support a fossil fuel project 
at the World Bank?
    Mr. Gorordo. Senator, thank you for your follow up 
question. As I shared and as you stated, I am not currently 
confirmed to this role and not in the Administration, but I do 
commit myself to work with my Treasury colleagues to get you a 
response to your question.
    Senator Barrasso. Can you tell me what actions the United 
States has taken already to end World Bank's support for fossil 
fuel?
    Mr. Gorordo. Again, Senator, currently not in the role so I 
cannot speak to the specifics and details. My understanding is, 
as I shared, that the current--the Administration is focused on 
balancing the short term and long term needs of each country.
    If confirmed, I will work to judge each project based on 
its own merits, taking into account the country's strategy and 
needs, and ensure that it is aligned with our U.S. regulations 
and policy, as well as the bank's guidance.
    Senator Barrasso. With regard to Russia in the World Bank, 
the World Bank has not provided any new financing for Russia 
since the invasion of Crimea in 2014. So we are going back now 
eight years. In March of this year, the World Bank suspended 
all programing in Russia.
    There has been some discussion by analysts that Russia 
should be suspended from its membership in the international 
financial institutions. Do you support a suspension of Russia's 
membership from the World Bank?
    Mr. Gorordo. Thank you, Senator, for that question. As I 
shared with the chair, as well as with Senator Hagerty when 
they asked a similar question, I take this opportunity to 
condemn Russia's unprovoked and illegal war in Ukraine.
    My understanding, as you stated, is that the bank has 
ceased all operations in Russia, as well as is not financing 
any additional projects in Russia. And I will work tirelessly 
with our allies in building coalition to effectively isolate 
Russia. And I can get you an answer back on----
    Senator Barrasso. And Madam Chairman, if I may, I have one 
question on China. Thank you, Madam Chairman. This is regarding 
China's predatory lending. You know, through the Belt and Road 
Initiative, the Chinese Communist Party offers countries the 
ability to borrow a lot of money for infrastructure projects.
    Problem is, these countries accumulate large amounts of 
debt, debt to China. They are unable to pay it back while still 
not achieving the development gains the countries are seeking. 
Unable to escape the massive debt owed to China, countries face 
default or forfeiture of strategic assets and natural 
resources.
    And we are seeing this around the world. So on top of the 
financial pressure, countries are now facing the economic 
hardships caused by coronavirus, inflation, energy crisis, 
things you have raised, is a recipe for disaster.
    What actions do you believe the World Bank should take, and 
how should we ensure that American taxpayers are not bailing 
out Chinese financial institutions and further enabling China's 
predatory lending?
    Mr. Gorordo. Thank you again, Senator, for that question 
regarding China. As I shared with the chair, as well as Senator 
Hagerty on similar questions, I believe we are, as the Deputy--
as the Secretary of Treasury and the Deputy Secretary have 
stated, in a strategic competition with China, and that China 
is in fact a maligned actor that tries to undercut American 
values and interests every chance that it gets, and that acts 
in an adversarial way, specifically also when it is trying to 
steal our intellectual property.
    In addition to that, with regards to procurement at the 
bank, you know, this is something that is very near and dear to 
my heart as I shared with the with the chair. I started my 
career working at the Commerce Department with our commercial 
service officers at the various multilateral development banks, 
including the World Bank, to help American companies be able to 
compete and get their fair share of contracts and to expand 
markets for U.S. products and services.
    And so I would work very closely with our allies and with 
the bank management to ensure that American companies are able 
to compete for those opportunities. And then with regards to 
China itself, with regards to its role at the bank, my 
understanding is that in 2018, as part of the capital increase 
of the bank, the bank made certain commitments to graduate 
countries that have met the criteria for graduation.
    And that China, because of its high per capita income, its 
own institutional capacity, as well as alternative sources of 
financing, has met that criteria. And I would work very closely 
to push back on China in regards to its adversarial actions as 
well as to ensure that it graduates, as the bank has made that 
commitment.
    Senator Barrasso. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Senator Barrasso. I just want 
to finish up with a few questions for Mr. Micaller with respect 
to Tajikistan. Can you talk about what we are seeing in terms 
of Tajikistan's economy from Russia's war on Ukraine?
    Mr. Micaller. Thank you, Madam Chair, for your question, 
and for highlighting this very important issue. I think it is 
important to note first and recognize the significant levers 
and pressure points that Russia has over Tajikistan, 
particularly the reliance on remittances from up to 1 million 
Tajik migrant workers in Russia, and Moscow's control over 
critical trade, infrastructure, transportation, and energy 
linkages.
    So they do have significant levers, and the Government of 
Tajikistan has long sought to diversify its economic partners. 
Russia's war against Ukraine has underscored the critical 
importance of continuing that approach.
    And I would add that supporting options and choices for the 
Tajik Government and the Tajik people has long underpinned our 
approach to the bilateral relationship, with an eye towards 
enhancing the country's security, prosperity, and sovereignty.
    If confirmed, I will continue this approach and continue to 
have these discussions with the Tajik Government and our 
partners. I do want to add that it is also important to 
recognize that in the face of the tremendous pressure and 
economic challenges resulting from Russia's war in Ukraine, 
Tajikistan continues to admirably attempt to pursue its own 
independent course, and I could offer several examples 
recently.
    It has continued to resist calls and pressure to join the 
Eurasian Economic Union. It has resisted calls to deploy 
peacekeeping troops from the Collective Security Treaty 
Organization to its own borders.
    And most significantly, the Government warned its own 
citizens, Tajik migrant workers in Russia, not to participate 
in Moscow's illegal war against the Ukrainian people, 
underscoring that such activities would be in violation of 
Tajikistan's own laws.
    So again, I do want to recognize the challenges they face 
and commit to working in partnership with the Government and 
with our likeminded friends to support their efforts to 
diversify economic relations.
    Senator Shaheen. It is impressive that the Government has 
taken that position. Has Russia responded in any way to their 
admonition to Tajik citizens?
    Mr. Micaller. I am aware of media reporting that there was 
continued pressure on Tajik migrant workers. There have been 
reports of document checks and threats of revoking registration 
and visas. And again, this is a significant threat to the 
economy and the livelihoods of individual Tajiks and families.
    Senator Shaheen. Well, thank you very much. Thank you to 
each of you. I am being told I need to go vote so we can close 
out our votes this afternoon, but we will leave the record of 
this hearing open until close of business tomorrow, November 
30th.
    And I hope that if you do receive any questions from my 
colleagues on the committee, that you will respond as soon as 
possible. Our hope is to advance your nominations in an 
expeditious way. I hope before the end of the year. And so 
anything you can do to help us to get that done would be 
appreciated.
    And again, thank you to each of you for your willingness to 
serve the country. At this time, I will close this hearing on 
the committee on Foreign Relations.


    [Whereupon, at 5:35 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]



                              ----------                              



              Additional Material Submitted for the Record


       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
          to Christopher T. Robinson by Senator James E. Risch

Russia
    Question. How will you engage with the Latvian Government and 
address their concerns about threats from Russia?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work closely with the Latvian 
Government to strengthen Latvia and NATO's ability to defend Latvian 
borders against Russia's aggression. Congress's generous support 
through Foreign Military Financing and Section 333 funds have been 
critical to U.S. Embassy Riga's work with the Latvian military to 
strengthen its defense and tighten integration with NATO defense 
planning. I will also work with the Canadians and other partner 
countries on the NATO battlegroup in Latvia to ensure plans are moving 
forward to strengthen that battlegroup in line with NATO's Madrid 
Summit declaration and Strategic Concept.

    Question. How will you respond to Latvia's requests for a stronger 
forward presence from the U.S. and NATO?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the U.S. Department of 
Defense to ensure our posture is commensurate to the threats and 
challenges we face on NATO's eastern flank. I will also work to 
continue implementing our commitment to maintain a persistent, heel-to-
toe presence in the region and intensify training with the Latvian 
Government to ensure that it is fully interoperable with NATO and 
capable of supporting the battle group it hosts.

    Question. How will you engage with the significant minority 
population of ethnic Russians living in Latvia and ensure they are not 
disenfranchised within U.S.-Latvian diplomatic efforts and fall under 
the malign influence of the Kremlin?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will regularly engage with the ethnic 
Russian population in Latvia through trips to Russian-speaking regions 
and engagement with Russian-speaking minority groups, so that these 
groups know that their voices are being heard and that they are welcome 
in the Transatlantic community. I will work with Latvian Russian-
language media to help them compete with Kremlin-controlled media and 
reach ethnic Russian populations with independent messaging.

    Question. What are the most effective ways Latvia can further its 
defense cooperation with the U.S. and within NATO?

    Answer. Latvia has done incredible work to strengthen its defense 
cooperation with the United States and NATO. Latvia has met its Wales 
Pledge commitment to spend two percent of GDP on defense in 2018, and 
plans to hit 2.5 percent in 2025. Latvia has worked closely with the 
United States and NATO to ensure that this spending effectively 
contributes to collective defense. It is currently working on plans to 
build additional facilities for the lodging and training of additional 
troops. If confirmed I will work with the Latvian Government to build 
on these efforts and strengthen the defense of NATO's Eastern Flank.

    Question. How will you respond to Latvia's requests for a stronger 
forward presence from the U.S. and NATO?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the U.S. Department of 
Defense to ensure our posture is commensurate to the threats and 
challenges we face on NATO's eastern flank. I will also work to 
continue implementing our commitment to maintain a persistent, heel-to-
toe presence in the region and intensify training with the Latvian 
Government to ensure that it is fully interoperable with NATO and 
capable of supporting the battle group it hosts.

Support to Ukraine
    Question. How will you work with the Government of Latvia to assist 
their efforts to host and provide support to Ukrainian refugees?

    Answer. Latvia provides government benefits to more than 43,000 
refugees from Ukraine, and there continues to be widespread public 
support for helping refugees despite the significant costs of hosting 
them. At the same time, the U.S. Department of State is developing ways 
for U.S. embassies in the Baltic states to complement these activities 
with small grants to local organizations to respond to critical gaps, 
not covered by existing federal, state, and local government. The State 
Department is also engaging with the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees to ensure that Latvia and other Baltic states are receiving 
the support they need. If confirmed, I will ensure the Embassy 
continues to support efforts to provide support to refugees from 
Ukraine in Latvia.

    Question. Latvia has given a significant amount of their military 
stocks to Ukraine. As Ambassador, how would you work with the 
Government of Latvia to assess their needs and help provide backfill 
for their military stocks?

    Answer. The U.S. Government has prioritized regional Foreign 
Military Financing for the Baltics to develop defensive capabilities, 
such as electronic and hybrid warfare, border security, and maritime 
and air domain awareness. It has also increased the Baltic states' 
interoperability with NATO armed forces and contributed to 
strengthening NATO's defense and deterrence posture in the region. If 
confirmed, I will continue to work with the U.S. Department of Defense 
and our Baltic Allies to align security assistance with our interests 
in enhancing collective defense and confronting Russia's aggression.

Economic Engagement and Energy
    Question. How will you support economic engagement between Latvian 
and U.S. business sectors?

    Answer. I will work closely with the Latvian Government, the U.S. 
business community, and the U.S. interagency to ensure a level playing 
field for U.S. companies and ensure that Latvian companies are aware of 
opportunities to partner with U.S. companies to strengthen supply 
chains and build needed infrastructure. I will work with the U.S. 
Department of Commerce to ensure that U.S. companies are aware of 
opportunities in Latvia and have everything they need to successfully 
compete for those opportunities.

    Question. What are the perceived risks to western investment, and 
how can they be mitigated?

    Answer. The Latvian Government has done incredible work in recent 
years to protect its economy from the risks of corrosive capital. 
Latvia launched a major anti-money laundering drive that has helped 
protect its banking sector from criminal activity and has implemented 
and strengthened investment screening legislation that will allow it to 
protect its economy from future malign investments. U.S. Embassy Riga 
has worked closely with the Latvian Government on these efforts, and, 
if confirmed I will continue sharing information and best practices to 
ensure that Latvia remains a safe place for U.S. investment.

    Question. What role, if any, do you see the U.S. Development 
Finance Corporation playing in stimulating western investment in 
Latvia?

    Answer. Latvia was extremely grateful for the U.S. Development 
Financing Corporation's (DFC) announcement of $300 million in loans to 
support the Three Seas Initiative, and looks forward to working with 
the DFC in coming years to bring more infrastructure investment to the 
region. Due to the European Energy Security and Diversification Act of 
2019, the DFC can be particularly helpful in supporting Latvia's 
efforts to break free from Russian energy dependence and meet its clean 
energy targets.

    Question. What sectors do you see as potential areas of growth for 
U.S.-Latvia business ties?

    Answer. Latvia has a growing technology sector, which is already 
closely tied to the United States. Latvia's first billion-dollar 
startup, Printful, has investments in Texas, California, and North 
Carolina. If confirmed I will work to strengthening ties between our 
technology sectors, to attract more investments like these and create 
more opportunities for U.S. exports.
    Latvia also has plans to expand investment in energy infrastructure 
in the next few years. It plans to build a liquified natural gas 
terminal in the next two years and is looking into the possibility of 
building a small modular nuclear reactor within the next decade. If 
confirmed, I hope to work with the Latvian Government to ensure that 
U.S. companies can take full advantage of these opportunities to expand 
their markets in Latvia.

    Question. What can the U.S. do to help Latvia maintain a sufficient 
supply of energy as it decouples from Russia?

    Answer. Latvia is building a new liquified natural gas (LNG) 
terminal and hopes that LNG will be able to fill the gap left by 
Russian gas until clean alternatives can be developed. U.S. efforts to 
expand production of LNG to meet this growing demand will be critical 
to Latvia's medium-term energy security. Over the longer-term, the U.S. 
can continue to work with Latvia and other countries in the region to 
develop and deploy clean energy technologies that can take the place of 
Russian gas, including potential investments in advanced nuclear 
reactors such as small modular nuclear reactors.

    Question. What can the U.S. do to help Latvia maintain a sufficient 
supply of energy as it decouples from Russia?

    Answer. Latvia is building a new liquified natural gas (LNG) 
terminal and hopes that LNG will be able to fill the gap left by 
Russian gas until clean alternatives can be developed. U.S. efforts to 
expand production of LNG to meet this growing demand will be critical 
to Latvia's medium-term energy security. Over the longer-term, the U.S. 
can continue to work with Latvia and other countries in the region to 
develop and deploy clean energy technologies that can take the place of 
Russian gas.

    Question. How can the U.S. help Latvia's efforts to decouple its 
electrical grid from Russia and Belarus and integrate with its western 
neighbors?

    Answer. The U.S. Department of State is supporting a technical 
assistance program to help the Baltics ensure the reliability and 
resilience of their grid with the goal of promoting a safe decoupling 
from the Russia-controlled BRELL electricity grid for all three 
countries, including Latvia. If confirmed, I will continue to work with 
Latvia to ensure that this process moves forward, and that Latvia has 
everything it needs to decouple as soon as possible.

    Question. How will you work with your State Department and 
interagency colleagues to coordinate U.S. economic engagement with 
Latvia across the Baltics and greater Eastern European region?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would work with the Latvian Government, 
fellow U.S. Ambassadors, the U.S. Department of State, and the 
interagency to ensure strong participation in regional forums such as 
the Three Seas Initiative and the U.S. Department of Energy's 
Partnership for Transatlantic Energy and Climate Cooperation (P-TECC). 
I will work with my colleagues within the U.S. Department of State and 
the interagency to ensure that the United States is aware of and fully 
engages with any opportunities to strengthen economic engagement and 
economic security.

State Department Manangement and Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. Missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Riga?

    Answer. U.S. Embassy Riga has faced challenges posed by COVID-19, 
and I am thankful for the staff's resilience and continued service. If 
confirmed, the health and safety of the personnel and family members of 
Mission Riga will be my top priority, and I look forward to working 
with the talented team of U.S. Direct Hires, locally employed staff, 
and their families, and ensuring that everyone on my team understands 
they are valued and have my support.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Riga?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will ensure everyone on my team is treated 
professionally, their rights are respected, they are safe and secure, 
and they have the resources necessary to perform their jobs. We are all 
one team working for the good of the U.S.-Latvian relationship and the 
interests of the United States and the American people.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Riga?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to ensuring open and 
continuous communication throughout the Mission. We are all one team 
working together to advance the U.S.-Latvian relationship and the 
interests of the American people, so I will ensure this collaborative 
service focus is central to our work. Furthermore, I am committed to 
supporting a diverse and inclusive workforce at U.S. Embassy Riga. 
Diversity makes the Mission strong by bringing different perspectives 
and enhancing creativity. If confirmed, I look forward to working with 
the team to maximize innovation and effectiveness.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I have been blessed with opportunities that have prepared 
me to be a Chief of Mission, and to build consensus among diverse 
stakeholders. I have demonstrated an ability to work with colleagues of 
all backgrounds and if confirmed, I will regularly engage with members 
of my team and always seek to create a space for open dialogue and 
diversity of thought. I also believe in leading by example. If 
confirmed, I will work hard to foster an environment of respect as U.S. 
Embassy Riga carries out important work on behalf of the American 
people.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No, it is never acceptable or constructive to berate 
subordinates, either in public or private. If confirmed, I will work 
hard to foster an environment of respect and professionalism as U.S. 
Embassy Riga carries out important work on behalf of the American 
people.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to a close and productive 
relationship with the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) to advance U.S. 
priorities in Latvia, including protecting the safety and security of 
Americans, expanding our economic relationship, and advancing shared 
priorities.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will entrust the Deputy Chief of Mission 
with responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the Mission and to 
serve as Charge d'Affaires in my absence. If confirmed, I will consult 
closely with the Deputy Chief of Mission on a range of issues and I 
will value the institutional knowledge that my talented fellow career 
Foreign Service officers provide.

    Question. Do you believe that it is important to provide employees 
with accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order to 
encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their 
roles?

    Answer. Yes, I believe it is important to provide employees with 
accurate, constructive feedback on their performance to encourage 
improvement and reward those who succeed in their roles. If confirmed, 
I hope to be an inspiring leader with an open-door policy to discuss 
constructive and timely feedback to enhance and lift the performance of 
the entire team.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I would support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees to improve performance and 
reward high achievers.
    It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts abroad to 
meet with local actors, including host government officials, non-
government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Greece.

    Question. In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our 
Embassy walls enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. I firmly believe it is imperative that U.S. diplomats get 
outside of the Embassy to meet with local citizens, including host 
government officials and non-governmental organizations. The COVID-19 
pandemic has been a challenge for U.S. diplomats to travel and fully 
engage face-to-face with host country nationals, but as conditions 
improve, I understand that U.S. diplomats have resumed in-person 
engagements and programs again, as appropriate.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to working closely with the 
Embassy public diplomacy section to use both social and traditional 
media to reach people across Latvia. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
accessibility are also an important part of public diplomacy outreach 
to ensure efforts reflect the diversity of U.S. society and societies 
abroad and encourage the involvement of people from traditionally 
underrepresented audiences. If confirmed, I will work with the Embassy 
team to leverage engagements with the media, cultural and educational 
exchange organizations, and individual interactions to expand the 
people-to-people bonds that are the foundation of our strong bilateral 
relationship.

    Question.  Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in 
Latvia?

    Answer. The U.S. has strong academic, cultural, and professional 
exchanges with the people of Latvia. If confirmed, I will work with my 
Embassy team to continue leveraging the media, cultural and educational 
exchange organizations, and individuals to expand the people-to-people 
bonds that are the foundation of our strong bilateral relationship.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. While the Kremlin's and the PRC's malign influence and 
disinformation have not gained a foothold in Latvia in recent years, 
both remain a persistent threat that requires vigilance.
    If confirmed, I will work with the Embassy team to continue its 
engagement with the Latvian Government to assess and address the 
threats of malign influence and disinformation posed by the Kremlin and 
the PRC. I will also encourage my team to continue its use of public 
diplomacy tools to expand digital and media literacy programs and to 
empower local opinion leaders who can raise awareness of these threats. 
Finally, I will ensure that we quickly deploy additional resources, in 
coordination with the Government of Latvia, should these threats become 
a new reality.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country Mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. We are all one team working to advance the bilateral 
relationship and the interests of the United States and the American 
people and if confirmed, I look forward to working with the offices at 
U.S. Department of State to advance U.S. foreign policy goals in 
Latvia. If confirmed, I will leverage public diplomacy resources to 
enhance security cooperation, strengthen collaboration on climate 
issues, expand economic and trade relations, and deepen people-to-
people ties that highlight our shared values. I will also work to 
counter malign influence, propaganda, and disinformation with the wide 
range of public diplomacy tools at our disposal. Working with the 
public diplomacy team, we will tailor our messaging in a way that is 
most appropriate for Latvian audiences.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
```Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes. I am deeply troubled by potential anomalous health 
incidents that might have affected U.S. Government personnel and their 
family members. Serving one's country overseas should not come at the 
cost of one's health. I agree that such incidents may pose a threat to 
the wellbeing of U.S. personnel, and must be taken extremely seriously. 
If confirmed, the health, safety, and security of Embassy staff, their 
family members, and all those supporting the Mission will be my highest 
priority.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Latvia personnel?

    Answer. If confirmed, I am committed to regularly share new 
information on this issue consistent with ensuring the integrity of 
ongoing investigations.

Trafficking in Persons
    Question. In the 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report, Latvia 
remained on Tier 2 for its increased efforts to prosecute more 
traffickers, identifying more victims, and approving a new national 
action plan. Yet, the Government did not investigate as many cases and 
fell behind in a few additional areas. How will you address these 
issues with the host government and civil society actors if you are 
confirmed as Ambassador?

    Answer. Latvia has made key achievements in this past reporting 
period, which if confirmed, I look forward to building on. If 
confirmed, I would leverage the TIP Report as the primary guide for 
U.S. anti-trafficking policy and encourage the Latvian Government to 
implement the TIP Report's prioritized recommendations, including to 
investigate, prosecute, and convict traffickers under the trafficking 
statute, develop and implement a national referral mechanism to include 
guidance on identification, referral, and information exchange among 
stakeholders, and enhance training for investigating cases and 
collecting evidence against suspected traffickers.

    Question. Do you commit to reporting accurate information as it 
pertains to the reality of the trafficking situation in Latvia?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to reporting accurate information as 
it pertains to the reality of the trafficking situation in Latvia.

International Religious Freedom
    Question. In the 2021 International Religious Freedom report, 
Latvia was noted as having several antisemitic and anti-Islam incidents 
and that U.S. officials in country continued engagements with religious 
and government leaders to press on the importance of religious 
tolerance. What is your assessment of this particular issue and if 
confirmed, how will you work with the office of the Ambassador-at-Large 
for international religious freedom to bolster religious freedom in-
country?

    Answer. In this past year, the Latvian Government showed its clear 
commitment to strengthening religious freedom when it passed a law in 
February providing =40 million in restitution for Jewish communal and 
heirless properties seized during the Holocaust. This money will be 
used to support and strengthen the Latvian Jewish community, and 
provides a clear signal that Latvia stands against religious 
intolerance. Our Embassy in Riga engages regularly with religious 
minority groups, the Latvian Government, and the U.S. Ambassador-at-
Large for international religious freedom, and, if confirmed, I will 
continue this engagement.

Human Rights
    Question. In the 2021 Human Rights Report, Latvia was identified as 
having no significant human rights abuses but the U.S. Mission can 
still support the work of civil society actors in country or regionally 
to better overall respect for human rights. How will you direct your 
Embassy to work with civil society organizations to improve the human 
rights situation on the ground?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would regularly engage with the Latvian 
Government to maintain its strong human rights record for all, through 
meetings and outreach with counterparts in the Government and 
throughout civil society. I would also ensure the Embassy regularly 
engages on this issue.

Refugees and Asylum Seekers
    Question. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Latvia 
has taken in around 43,000 Ukrainian refugees, a number equal to nearly 
2.3 percent of its population. Latvia has also been a destination for 
Russian citizens who are leaving their country to avoid the military 
draft or to escape persecution by their government for anti-war or 
anti-government views or actions.

   Do you believe that Ukrainian refugees in Latvia are being well-
        treated? Do you have any concerns that they will be subject to 
        human trafficking or otherwise exploited?

    Answer. Latvia's unflagging support for more than 43,000 refugees 
from Ukraine, is yet another example of its willingness to support 
Ukraine despite the economic cost. The Embassy engages regularly with 
the Government, and NGOs supporting the migrant community, and we have 
seen that refugees are being treated well, though resources in some 
cases are strained. The U.S. Department of State is developing ways for 
embassies to complement these activities with small grants to local 
organizations to respond to critical gaps, not covered by existing 
federal, state, and local government. If confirmed I commit to working 
with the Latvian Government, international organizations, and local 
partners to protect these refugees.

    Question. If it becomes clear that Ukrainian refugees in Latvia are 
being exploited or poorly-treated, would you as ambassador commit to 
raising their condition with the Government of Latvia and acting to 
defend their human rights?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to regularly engaging with the 
Government of Latvia on the status of refugees from Ukraine, including 
raising their condition with the Government of Latvia and acting to 
defend their human rights if it becomes clear that refugees from 
Ukraine are being exploited or poorly treated.

    Question. Do you believe that Russian asylum-seekers refugees in 
Latvia are being well-treated?

    Answer. The Latvian Government has a long history of welcoming 
dissidents and exiles from Russia, including hosting the Russian-media 
outlet Meduza since 2014. Since the start of Russia's full-scale 
invasion of Ukraine, Latvia has welcomed more than 400 journalists and 
their families from Russia. This record is why U.S. institutions such 
as Radio Free Europe have felt comfortable basing their Russian 
language operations in Riga.
    Latvia has attempted to balance this effort with a policy of 
denying visas to those looking to escape sanctions or to engage in 
disruptive activities in Latvia or in the EU. Our Embassy in Riga has 
been in regular discussion with the Latvian authorities to ensure that 
the needs of legitimate asylum seekers are being taken into account 
during this process, and if confirmed I will continue to work with the 
Latvian authorities on this issue.

    Question. News reports indicate that Russian asylum-seekers in 
Latvia and other Baltic nations are increasingly made to feel unwelcome 
by both the local populations and governments. If confirmed, do you 
commit to using the resources of the U.S. Embassy in Riga to track the 
treatment of Russian asylum-seekers in Latvia and to encouraging the 
Government of Latvia to provide them with the rights and treatment 
guaranteed them under European Union law?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will use the resources of the U.S. 
Embassy in Riga to track the treatment of Russian Federation nationals 
who are asylum-seekers in Latvia and will encourage the Government of 
Latvia to provide them with the rights and treatment guaranteed to them 
under European Union law.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
           to Christopher T. Robinson by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. As we speak, the Party is 
cracking down on unprecedented student protests across the country. 
With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry, the CCP 
could stop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. The President made it clear in his National Security 
Strategy that the People's Republic of China (PRC) harbors the 
intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international 
order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its 
benefit. As Secretary Blinken said on May 26, we will invest in 
America, align with our Allies, and compete with the PRC to defend our 
interests and build our vision for the future. If confirmed, I will 
strengthen our partnership with Latvia concerning the PRC.

    Question. Does the CCP undertake any activities that are beneficial 
to U.S. interests?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors, as the President 
laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United States does not 
seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our allies and partners have an 
opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in a way that 
influences their behavior even as we compete with them. The United 
States' approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC 
where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them when 
they align. If confirmed, I will continue working closely with Latvia 
to strengthen our shared values of democracy and support for the rules-
based order.

    Question. Do you believe there are any areas within which the CCP 
would constructively work with the United States in good faith?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors, as the President 
laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United States does not 
seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our allies and partners have an 
opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in a way that 
influences their behavior even as we compete with them. The United 
States' approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC 
where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them when 
they align. If confirmed, I will continue working closely with Latvia 
to strengthen our shared values of democracy and support for the rules-
based order.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China in 
Latvia?

    Answer. As the United States National Security Strategy makes clear 
and as Secretary Blinken said in October, the People's Republic of 
China (PRC) is the greatest geopolitical challenge that we face because 
it is the only competitor with the intent and increasingly the 
capability to remake the international order. And Beijing's actions 
suggest PRC officials have the intention to do so. Latvia shares our 
skepticism of the PRC and has downgraded its cooperation and actively 
pushed back against PRC influence, including departing the regional 
mechanism formerly known as 17+1 (now 14+1 after Estonia, Latvia, and 
Lithuania exited), protecting Latvian critical infrastructure from 
untrusted vendors, and putting in place CFIUS-like legislation to 
review foreign direct investment in Latvia. The United States' approach 
towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC where our interests 
and values differ and cooperating with them when they align. If 
confirmed, I will support the Administration's policy on the PRC.

    Question. Since Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine 
this past February, the United States has provided the largest amount 
of security and financial assistance to Ukraine. While this assistance, 
if properly overseen and monitored, is a cost-effective way to 
safeguard American interests in Europe, our European allies and 
partners must also step up to assist Ukraine in fending off Putin's 
assault on their doorstep. In contrast to other European states, Latvia 
has gone above and beyond in providing military assistance to Ukraine. 
In this year alone, Latvia has provided 32.1 percent of its total 
defense budget to Ukraine. To compare, total U.S. assistance to Ukraine 
equals just 3.3 percent of our defense budget.

   What can the United States do, in concert with other European 
        allies, to ensure Latvia and other frontline states can 
        continue to provide military assistance to Ukraine while also 
        maintaining their own defensive readiness against a Russian 
        attack on their own borders?

    Answer. Latvia has been a steadfast defender--along with the United 
States and other European Allies and partners--of Ukraine's sovereignty 
and territorial integrity. If confirmed, I will work to ensure U.S. and 
Latvian policies toward Russia remain closely coordinated.
    Latvia faces continued security threats from Russia. To combat 
these threats our assistance focuses on bolstering NATO 
interoperability, deterrence, and defense, strengthening Latvian 
national defenses, and combating hybrid threats. Since 2017, the United 
States provided approximately $478 million in total security assistance 
to build Latvia's defensive capabilities and over $145 million in 
Foreign Military Financing this year. The resurgence of Russia's 
aggression has changed the priorities for these investments and 
resulted in Latvia's request to procure more capable military systems 
such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).
    The State Department has prioritized regional Foreign Military 
Financing for the Baltics to develop defensive capabilities, such as 
electronic and hybrid warfare, border security, and maritime and air 
domain awareness. If confirmed, I will continue to work with the 
Department of Defense and our Baltic Allies to align security 
assistance with our interests in enhancing collective security and 
confronting Russia's aggression.

    Question. Is there a role that Latvia and other Baltic states play 
in ensuring that assistance provided to Ukraine is properly used and 
not siphoned off by corruption?

    Answer. The U.S. Plan to Counter Illicit Diversion of Certain 
Advanced Conventional Weapons in Eastern Europe is a comprehensive, 
whole-of-government approach to mitigate the risk of illicit diversion 
of advanced weapons systems transferred to Ukraine for its urgent 
defense needs. The Plan has three lines of effort:


   Bolster Accountability through safeguarding and accounting for arms 
        and munitions in Ukraine and neighboring countries when they 
        are transferred, stored, and deployed;

   Strengthen Borders by enhancing regional border management and 
        security; and

   Build Capacity of security forces, law enforcement, and border 
        control agencies in the region to deter, detect, and interdict 
        illicit arms trafficking.


    The Plan emphasizes the importance of cooperation with Allies and 
partners. The United States is coordinating closely with both NATO and 
the European Union, the latter of which is developing its own plan that 
will complement ours. As EU Member States, Latvia and its Baltic 
neighbors will be well positioned to support similar lines of effort 
and contribute to counter-diversion efforts. The United States can also 
work with Latvia to identify bilateral activities, as well as through 
NATO, to pursue these efforts.

    Question. Since February, the CCP has worked feverishly to create 
the facade that it's somehow not complicit in Putin's invasion of 
Ukraine. They do this by issuing statements emphasizing their support 
for a peaceful resolution and respect for sovereignty. In reality, the 
CCP continues to purchase Russian energy and do business with 
sanctioned Russian companies. Earlier this year, Latvia and Estonia 
both withdrew from the ``Cooperation between China and Central and 
Eastern European Countries Initiative,'' also known as the ``16+1,'' 
which the CCP uses to promote its views within Europe. In August, I 
sent a letter to the President, urging the Administration to support 
countries that leave the 16+1 and face a CCP economic blockade as a 
result.

   What consequences has the CCP tried to impose on Latvia since it 
        announced it was leaving the 16+1?

    Answer. Latvia, in coordination with Estonia, left the PRC's 
initiative originally known as 17+1 (from 2019-21), then 16+1 (2021-22 
after Lithuania departed), and now 14+1, having assessed it delivered 
little benefit. Latvia and the PRC have a limited economic 
relationship, with no observed fallout since the Latvia withdrawal. If 
confirmed, I will continue our close consultations with Latvia on this 
matter.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to working with Latvia to 
help convince other European countries to also withdraw from 16+1?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to working with Latvian 
officials and the Latvian business community on the challenges posed by 
the PRC, as well as working to increase U.S.-Latvian trade and economic 
ties. We must collaborate to promote shared economic growth and work 
together to ensure PRC investment meets global best practices for 
transparency and good governance, while warning our partners of the 
PRC's economic coercion and market distorting practices.

            to Christopher T. Robinson by Senator Todd Young

    Question. You stated that, if confirmed, your ``first priority 
would be to ensure the safety and security of U.S. citizens in the 
Republic of Latvia.'' Aside from Russian influence and aggression, what 
do you assess impacts U.S. citizen security and safety within Latvia?

    Answer. Latvia is a safe country, but U.S. citizens in Latvia face 
a range of problems typical to visitors and residents of any country, 
including sickness, injury, and occasional petty crime. Beyond these 
issues, the threat of Russia's aggression and malign activities poses a 
unique threat and must be deterred.

    Question. As Ambassador, what steps would you take to engage the 
U.S. citizen community to accomplish this?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with our consular team to ensure 
our U.S. citizens are registered with the Embassy and that they are 
aware of the resources available to help the U.S. citizen community in 
Latvia. We will engage in regular outreach to the U.S. citizen 
community in Latvia to ensure we know what problems they face, and that 
they know we are there to help them.

    Question. I was intrigued at your specific mention of China's 
economic aggression. If confirmed, what steps would you take to 
demonstrate to Beijing that such behavior will not be tolerated in 
Latvia?

    Answer. The PRC's recent economic coercion of Lithuania, Latvia's 
neighbor, over the name of the local Taiwan representative office was a 
wake-up call for the entire EU. The U.S. Department of State has 
actively engaged the region to make sure that governments are aware of 
the risks of economic dependence on Beijing and ensure that countries 
can access alternative vendors for critical infrastructure and critical 
supply chain goods. Latvia takes this risk seriously and, if confirmed, 
I will work with the Latvian Government to strengthen economic ties and 
develop resilient, strong supply chains.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
         Submitted to George P. Kent by Senator James E. Risch

Russia
    Question. How will you engage with the Estonian Government and 
address their concerns about threats from Russia?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work closely with the Estonian 
Government to strengthen Estonia and NATO's ability to defend Estonian 
borders against Russia's aggression and counter cyber threats. 
Congress's generous support through Foreign Military Financing and 
Section 333 funds have been critical to U.S. Embassy Tallinn's work 
with the Estonian military to strengthen its defenses and tighten 
integration with NATO defense planning. The United States has been a 
member of the Estonia-based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of 
Excellence since 2011. I will also work with the United Kingdom and 
other partner countries on the NATO battlegroup in Estonia to ensure 
plans are moving forward to strengthen that battlegroup in line with 
the NATO Madrid Summit declaration and Strategic Concept.

    Question. How will you engage with the significant minority 
population of ethnic Russians living in Estonia and ensure they are not 
disenfranchised within U.S.-Estonian diplomatic efforts and fall under 
the malign influence of the Kremlin?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will regularly engage with the ethnic 
Russian population in Estonia through trips to Russian-speaking regions 
and support for programs that promote social inclusion so that these 
Russian speakers in Estonia know that their voices are being heard and 
that they are welcome in the Transatlantic community. I will also work 
with Estonia-based Russian-language media to help them increase their 
reach into ethnic Russian populations, providing independent messaging 
that can counter Kremlin-based media narratives.

Defense
    Question. What are the most effective ways Estonia can further its 
defense cooperation with the U.S. and within NATO?

    Answer. Estonia has done incredible work to strengthen its defense 
cooperation with the United States and NATO. Estonia has exceeded its 
Wales Pledge commitment to spend two percent of GDP on defense; it is 
on track to spend close to three percent of GDP in 2023. Estonia has 
worked closely with the United States and NATO to ensure that this 
spending effectively contributes to collective defense. If confirmed I 
will work with the Estonian Government to build on these efforts and 
strengthen the defense of the eastern flank.

    Question. How will you respond to Estonia's requests for a stronger 
forward presence from the U.S. and NATO?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the U.S. Department of 
Defense to ensure that we follow through with the commitments made in 
the NATO Madrid Summit declaration to provide heel-to-toe rotations of 
U.S. troops in the region. If confirmed, I will also work with the 
Estonian Government to ensure that it is fully prepared to host and 
work with any additional U.S. troops.

Support To Ukraine
    Question. How will you work with the Government of Estonia to 
assist their efforts to host and provide support to Ukrainian refugees?

    Answer. Estonia hosts more than 60,000 refugees from Ukraine. This 
represents about 4.6 percent of the population of Estonia. Refugees 
from Ukraine are entitled to register for Temporary Protection in 
Estonia, which provides access to work, housing, healthcare, and 
education. While support for hosting refugees from Ukraine among 
Estonian citizens remains high--at more than seventy percent--the costs 
of hosting them are significant. The U.S. Department of State is 
engaging through U.S. Embassy Tallinn with U.N. and other international 
organizations to coordinate U.S. humanitarian assistance to the 
refugees. At the same time, the U.S. Department of State is developing 
ways for embassies to complement these activities with small grants to 
local organizations to respond to critical gaps. If confirmed, I will 
ensure the Embassy continues to support efforts to provide support to 
refugees from Ukraine in Estonia.

    Question. Estonia and the U.S. are developing the ``Shield Wall'' 
project to support cyber defense training and resilience in Ukraine. As 
Ambassador, how will you take part in this effort?

    Answer. Estonia is a close bilateral partner with which we 
collaborate on a wide range of cyber issues, including cybersecurity, 
cyber defense, and cyber capacity building programming. The host of the 
NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE), Estonia 
also stands as a strong likeminded partner, advancing responsible state 
behavior in cyberspace across numerous multilateral fora and finding 
tools to deter state-sponsored malicious cyber activity. If confirmed, 
I look forward to strengthening our cooperation with the Estonian 
Government, CCDCOE, and the local IT industry on cyber issues.

    Question. Estonia has given a significant amount of their military 
stocks to Ukraine. As Ambassador, how would you work with the 
Government of Estonia to assess their needs and help provide backfill 
for their military stocks?

    Answer. Since 2016, the United States provided approximately $442 
million in total security assistance to build Estonia's defensive 
capabilities, including over $140 million in Foreign Military Financing 
in Fiscal Year 2022, as well as Section 333 funds as part of the Baltic 
Security Initiative. The resurgence of Russia's aggression has changed 
the priorities for these investments and resulted in Estonia's request 
to procure more capable military systems such as the High Mobility 
Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), as announced in June.
    The State Department has prioritized regional Foreign Military 
Financing for the Baltics to develop defensive capabilities, such as 
electronic and hybrid warfare, border security, and maritime and air 
domain awareness. It has also increased the Baltic states' 
interoperability with NATO armed forces and contributed to 
strengthening NATO's defense and deterrence posture in the region. If 
confirmed, I will continue to work with the U.S. Department of Defense, 
European Command, and our Baltic allies to align security assistance to 
build their capabilities with our interests in enhancing collective 
security and confronting Russia's aggression.

Economic Engagement and Energy
    Question. How will you support economic engagement between Estonian 
and U.S. business sectors?

    Answer. I will work closely with the Estonian Government, the U.S. 
and Estonian business communities, and the U.S. interagency to ensure a 
level playing field for U.S. companies and make sure that Estonian 
companies are aware of opportunities to partner with U.S. companies to 
strengthen supply chains, migrate to green energy options, including 
nuclear and renewables, and build needed infrastructure. I will work 
with the U.S. Department of Commerce to ensure that U.S. companies are 
aware of opportunities in Estonia and have everything they need to 
successfully compete for those opportunities.

    Question. What are the perceived risks to western investment, and 
how can they be mitigated?

    Answer. The Estonian Government has taken steps in recent years to 
protect its economy from the risks of corrosive capital and untrusted 
vendors. A committee of government experts and a parliamentary working 
group have both made recommendations for improving Estonia's regime to 
prevent and prosecute financial crimes in Estonia. The Parliament has 
approved a series of legal changes to strengthen Estonia's anti-money 
laundering regime. In 2021, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) was 
re-established as an independent agency under the Ministry of Finance 
and provided additional resources to enhance supervision. U.S. Embassy 
Tallinn has worked closely with the Estonian Government on these 
efforts, including providing a U.S. Treasury Advisor to the FIU., If 
confirmed I will continue sharing information and best practices to 
ensure that Estonia remains a safe place for U.S. investment.

    Question. What role, if any, do you see the U.S. Development 
Finance Corporation playing in stimulating western investment in 
Estonia?

    Answer. Estonia was grateful for the U.S. Development Financing 
Corporation's (DFC) announcement of $300 million in loans to support 
the Three Seas Initiative and looks forward to working with the DFC in 
coming years to bring more infrastructure investment to the region. Due 
to the European Energy Security and Diversification Act of 2019, the 
DFC can be particularly helpful in supporting the region's efforts to 
break free from its dependence on Russian energy and meet its clean 
energy targets.

    Question. What sectors do you see as potential areas of growth for 
U.S.-Estonia business ties?

    Answer. The United States' trade relationship with Estonia is 
driven in large part by innovative small- and medium-sized enterprises, 
a sector in which Estonian companies have been particularly successful, 
as well as the IT sector. The United States and Estonia work closely 
together to drive technological innovation. As leaders in the digital 
arena, Estonian businesses provide innovative solutions in a wide range 
of sectors: retail sales software, delivery robots, money transfer 
services, and telecommunications solutions to U.S. companies. They have 
also helped with supply chain issues, replacing untrusted vendors. If 
confirmed, I will work with the Government and the private sector to 
increase and strengthen our trade and economic ties.

    Question. What can the U.S. do to help Estonia maintain a 
sufficient supply of energy as it decouples from Russia?

    Answer. Estonia has committed to ending imports of Russian gas by 
2023 and has secured rights to purchase LNG from a floating terminal 
based in Finland. Estonia is currently investing in alternate sources 
of energy, including renewables and LNG. Over the longer-term, the U.S. 
can continue to work with Estonia, Latvia, and other countries in the 
region to develop and deploy clean energy technologies that can take 
the place of Russian gas.

    Question. How can the U.S. help Estonia's efforts to decouple its 
electrical grid from Russia and Belarus and integrate with its western 
neighbors?

    Answer. The U.S. Department of State is providing technical 
assistance to the Estonia and its neighbors to help them through the 
process needed to ensure that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania can safely 
decouple from the Russia-controlled BRELL electricity grid and join 
ENTSO-E, the European network, a move currently scheduled to take place 
by 2025. If confirmed, I will continue to work with Estonia to ensure 
that this process moves forward, and that Estonia with its two 
neighbors has everything it needs to decouple as soon as possible.

    Question. How will you work with your State Department and 
interagency colleagues to coordinate U.S. economic engagement with 
Estonia across the Baltics and greater Eastern European region?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would work with the Estonian Government, 
fellow U.S. Ambassadors, the U.S. Department of State, and the 
interagency to strong participation in regional economic forums such as 
the Three Seas Initiative and Partnership for Transatlantic Energy and 
Climate Cooperation. I will work with my colleagues within the U.S. 
Department of State and the interagency to ensure that the United 
States and our business community are aware of and fully engages with 
any opportunities to strengthen economic engagement and economic 
security.

State Department Management and Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. Missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID.

   What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission Tallinn?

    Answer. Mission Tallinn has faced challenges posed by COVID-19, and 
I am thankful for the staff's resilience and continued service, as 
reflected in a positive Office of the Inspector General periodic review 
in early 2022. The current Chancery, in use for nearly 100 years, is 
cramped, and a more spacious replacement facility is currently in the 
design phase, years away from completion. If confirmed, the health and 
safety of the personnel and family members of Mission Tallinn will be 
my top priority, and I look forward to working with the talented team 
of U.S. Direct Hires, locally employed staff, and their families, and 
ensuring that everyone on my team understands they are valued and has 
my support.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Tallinn?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will ensure everyone on my team is treated 
professionally, their rights are respected, they are safe and secure, 
and they have the resources necessary to perform their jobs. We are all 
one team working for the good of the U.S.-Estonian relationship and the 
interests of the United States and the American people. Local staff 
compensation and retention are related issues, and I will work with the 
Department of State on local staff compensation in a high inflation 
country.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Tallinn?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to ensuring open and 
continuous communication throughout the Mission. Since we are all one 
team working together to advance the U.S.-Estonian relationship and the 
interests of the American people, I will ensure this collaborative 
service focus is central to our work. Furthermore, I am committed to 
supporting a diverse and inclusive workforce at U.S. Embassy Tallinn. 
Diversity makes the Mission strong by bringing different perspectives 
and enhancing creativity. If confirmed, I look forward to working with 
the team to maximize innovation and effectiveness.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. In my 30 years in the Foreign Service, I have worked to 
model integrity, ensure accountability, built consensus among diverse 
stakeholders. I have consistently acted in the spirit that sharing 
information, rather than restricting it, empowers the entire team to 
perform better. I have demonstrated an ability to work with colleagues 
of all backgrounds, and if confirmed, I will regularly engage with 
members of my team and always seek to create a space for open dialogue 
and diversity of thought. If confirmed, I will work hard to foster an 
environment of respect as Embassy Tallinn carries out important work on 
behalf of the American people.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No. It is never acceptable or constructive to berate 
subordinates, either in public or private.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to a close and productive 
relationship with the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM). From my own 
experience as DCM in Kyiv, Ukraine, I know that it is critical to have 
full alignment between an ambassador and Deputy Chief of Mission, 
working smoothly as a team. I would work closely with the DCM to manage 
our Mission and advance U.S. priorities in Estonia, including 
protecting the safety and security of Americans, expanding our economic 
relationship, and addressing the security challenges faced by Estonia 
and the transatlantic community.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will entrust the Deputy Chief of Mission 
with responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the Mission, to 
serve as Charge d'Affaires in my absence, and be another important 
voice in our public diplomacy outreach. If confirmed, I will consult 
closely with the Deputy Chief of Mission on every issue that I will 
address as Chief of Mission.


    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Yes, I believe it is important to provide employees with 
accurate, constructive feedback on their performance to encourage 
improvement and reward those who most succeed in their roles. If 
confirmed, I will continue with my career-long, open-door approach to 
be open to ideas and to share constructive and timely feedback to 
enhance and lift the performance of the entire team.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I would support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees to improve performance and 
reward high achievers.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Greece.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our Embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. I firmly believe that all U.S. diplomats, not just the 
Ambassador and public diplomacy section officers, should regularly 
engage with local citizens, including host government officials, 
students, businesses, and non-governmental organizations. We all have 
stories of America to share. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge 
for U.S. diplomats to travel and fully engage face-to-face with host 
country nationals, but as conditions have improved, U.S. diplomats have 
resumed in-person engagements and programs, as appropriate.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to working closely with the 
Embassy public diplomacy section to use both social and traditional 
media to reach people across Estonia, as well as our America Spaces in 
four Estonian cities, and to expand the number of day trips for 
outreach in the geographically compact country. Diversity, equity, 
inclusion, and accessibility are also an important part of public 
diplomacy outreach to ensure efforts reflect the diversity of U.S. 
society and societies abroad and encourage the involvement of people 
from traditionally underrepresented audiences. If confirmed, I will 
work with the Embassy team to leverage engagements with the media, 
cultural and educational exchange organizations, and individual 
interactions to expand the people-to-people bonds that are the 
foundation of our strong bilateral relationship.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in 
Estonia?

    Answer. We have strong public diplomacy engagement with the people 
of Estonia, through academic, cultural, and professional exchanges and 
programs. The level of English usage is strong, particularly in the 
student and business populations, and Estonians are receptive to 
Americans and our outreach. If confirmed, I will work with my Embassy 
team to continue our strong partnerships with the media, cultural, 
educational, and business organizations, and individuals to expand the 
people-to-people bonds that are the foundation of our strong bilateral 
relationship.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. While Kremlin and PRC malign influence and disinformation 
have not gained a foothold in Estonia in recent years, both remain 
persistent threats that requires vigilance.
    If confirmed, I will work with the Embassy team to continue 
engagement with the Estonian Government and civil society to assess and 
address the threats of malign influence and disinformation posed by the 
Kremlin and the PRC. I will also encourage my team to continue its use 
of public diplomacy tools to expand digital and media literacy programs 
and to empower local opinion leaders who can raise awareness of these 
threats. Finally, I will ensure that we quickly deploy additional 
resources, in coordination with the Government of Estonia, should these 
threats become a new reality.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country Mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. We are all one team working to advance the bilateral 
relationship and the interests of the United States and the American 
people. If confirmed, I look forward to working with the offices at 
U.S. Department of State in Washington to advance U.S. foreign policy 
goals in Estonia. If confirmed, I will leverage public diplomacy 
resources to enhance security cooperation, strengthen collaboration on 
climate issues, expand economic and trade relations, and deepen people-
to-people ties that highlight our shared values. I will also work to 
counter malign influence, and disinformation with the wide range of 
public diplomacy tools at our disposal. Working with the public 
diplomacy team, we will tailor our messaging in a way that is most 
appropriate for Estonian audiences.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes. I am deeply troubled by potential anomalous health 
incidents that might have affected U.S. Government personnel and their 
family members, and have received both unclassified and classified 
briefings. Serving one's country overseas should not come at the cost 
of one's health. I agree that such incidents may pose a threat to the 
wellbeing of U.S. personnel and must be taken extremely seriously. If 
confirmed, the health, safety, and security of Embassy staff, their 
family members, and all those supporting the Mission will be my highest 
priority, and I am committed to good communication to all stakeholders 
in such situations.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Estonia personnel?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I am committed to regularly share new 
information on this issue consistent with ensuring the integrity of 
ongoing investigations.

Trafficking in Persons
    Question. In the 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report, Estonia 
remained on Tier 1 for its sustained efforts to combat human 
trafficking but fell behind in a few key areas, including less 
prosecutions and convictions of suspected traffickers. How will you 
work with the host government and civil society actors to address these 
issues if you are confirmed as Ambassador?

    Answer. Estonia has made key progress during this past reporting 
period which, if confirmed, I look forward to building on. As noted in 
this year's TIP Report, the Estonian Government ordered convicted 
traffickers to pay restitution and approved a four-year violence 
prevention agreement, which included several anti-trafficking 
activities. Additionally, the Government participated in a European 
study aimed at exploring the national practices of detecting, 
identifying, and protecting potential foreign trafficking victims 
through national policy and legislative developments. If confirmed, I 
would leverage the TIP Report as the primary guide for U.S. anti-
trafficking policy and encourage the Estonian Government to implement 
the TIP Report's prioritized recommendations, including to investigate, 
prosecute, and convict traffickers under the anti-trafficking provision 
and develop and implement a reliable comprehensive statistical system 
for collecting and collating data.

    Question. Do you commit to reporting accurate information as it 
pertains to the reality of the trafficking situation in Estonia?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to reporting accurate information as 
it pertains to the reality of the trafficking situation in Estonia.

International Religious Freedom
    Question. In the 2021 International Religious Freedom report, 
Estonia was listed as protecting religious freedom, but antisemitic 
acts in society were common. What is your assessment of this particular 
issue and if confirmed, how will you work with the office of the 
Ambassador-at-Large for international religious freedom to bolster 
religious freedom in-country?

    Answer. The U.S. Department of State is monitoring the rise of 
antisemitism across Europe. In April 2021, the Estonian Government 
approved a plan to combat antisemitism designed by representatives of 
the Ministries of the Interior, Culture, Foreign Affairs, Education and 
Research, and Justice, the Police and Border Guard Board, the Estonian 
Jewish Community, and the Estonian Jewish Congregation. If confirmed, I 
will regularly meet with the Jewish community to discuss religious 
tolerance and the state of religious freedom in Estonia. I will also 
work with the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious 
Freedom, the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism, the 
Estonian Government, and Estonian civil society to raise the importance 
of combating antisemitism, promoting religious tolerance, and promoting 
Holocaust education in meetings with government officials.

Human Rights
    Question. In the 2021 Human Rights Report, Estonia was listed as 
having no reports of significant human rights abuses, but the U.S. 
Mission can still support civil society actors in country to bolster 
human rights. How will you direct your Embassy to work with civil 
society organizations to improve the human rights situation on the 
ground?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would regularly engage with the Estonian 
Government to maintain its strong human rights record for all, through 
meetings and outreach with counterparts in the Government and 
throughout civil society. I would also ensure the Embassy regularly 
engages on this issue.

Refugees and Asylum Seekers
    Question. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Estonia 
has taken in 62,000 Ukrainian refugees, a number equal to nearly 5 
percent of its population. Estonia has also been a destination for 
Russian citizens who are leaving their country to avoid the military 
draft or to escape persecution by their government for anti-war or 
anti-government views or actions.

   Do you believe that Ukrainian refugees in Estonia are being well-
        treated? Do you have any concerns that they will be subject to 
        human trafficking or otherwise exploited?

    Answer. Estonia hosts more than 60,000 refugees from Ukraine. More 
than seventy percent of all Estonian citizens support hosting refugees. 
The Estonian Government has undertaken generous efforts to ensure the 
safety and security of refugees from Ukraine, including registering 
nearly 39,000 for temporary protection benefits. If confirmed, I will 
continue to work closely with the Estonian Government, international 
organizations, and local partners to protect refugees.

    Question. If it becomes clear that Ukrainian refugees in Estonia 
are being exploited or poorly-treated, would you as Ambassador commit 
to raising their condition with the Government of Estonia and acting to 
defend their human rights?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would regularly engage with the Estonian 
Government to maintain its strong human rights record, through meetings 
and outreach with counterparts in the Government and throughout civil 
society.

    Question. Do you believe that Russian asylum-seekers refugees in 
Estonia are being well-treated?

    Answer. Estonia is already home to more than 300,000 native Russian 
speakers, a category that includes ethnic Russians and other 
nationalities from the former Soviet Union. Estonia has continued to 
provide humanitarian exceptions to travel restrictions imposed on 
Russian citizens following Russia's further invasion of Ukraine. Our 
Embassy in Tallinn has been in regular discussion with the Estonian 
authorities to ensure that the needs of legitimate asylum seekers are 
being taken into account during this process, and if confirmed I will 
continue to work with the Estonian authorities on this issue.

    Question. News reports indicate that Russian asylum-seekers in 
Estonia and other Baltic nations are increasingly made to feel 
unwelcome by both the local populations and governments. If confirmed, 
do you commit to using the resources of the U.S. Embassy in Tallinn to 
track the treatment of Russian asylum-seekers in Estonia and to 
encouraging the Government of Estonia to provide them with the rights 
and treatment guaranteed them under European Union law?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will use the resources of the U.S. 
Embassy in Tallinn to monitor the treatment of Russian Federation 
nationals who are asylum-seekers in Estonia and to encourage the 
Government of Estonia to provide them with the rights and treatment 
guaranteed them under European Union law.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
           Submitted to George P. Kent by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. As we speak, the Party is 
cracking down on unprecedented student protests across the country. 
With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry, the CCP 
could stop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. The President made it clear in his National Security 
Strategy that the People's Republic of China (PRC) harbors the 
intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international 
order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its 
benefit. As Secretary Blinken said on May 26, we will invest in 
America, align with our Allies, and compete with the PRC to defend our 
interests and build our vision for the future. If confirmed, I will 
strengthen our partnership with Estonia, including working with Estonia 
to implement investment screening mechanisms to protect ports and other 
critical infrastructure.

    Question. Does the CCP undertake any activities that are beneficial 
to U.S. interests?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors, as the President 
laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United States does not 
seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our allies and partners have an 
opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in a way that 
influences their behavior even as we compete with them. The United 
States' approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC 
where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them when 
they align. If confirmed, I will continue working closely with Estonia 
to strengthen our shared values of democracy and support for the rules-
based order.

    Question. Do you believe there are any areas within which the CCP 
would constructively work with the United States in good faith?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors, as the President 
laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United States does not 
seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our allies and partners have an 
opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in a way that 
influences their behavior even as we compete with them. The United 
States' approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC 
where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them when 
they align. If confirmed, I will continue working closely with Estonia 
to strengthen our shared values of democracy and support for the rules-
based order.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China in 
Estonia?

    Answer. As the United States National Security Strategy makes clear 
and as Secretary Blinken said in October, the People's Republic of 
China (PRC) is the greatest geopolitical challenge that we face because 
it is the only competitor with the intent and increasingly the 
capability to remake the international order. And Beijing's actions 
suggest PRC officials have the intention to do so. Estonia shares our 
skepticism of the PRC and has downgraded its cooperation and actively 
pushed back against PRC influence, including departing the regional 
mechanism formerly known as 17+1 (now 14+1 after Estonia, Latvia, and 
Lithuania exited), passing legislation to protect Estonian supply 
chains from untrusted vendors, and forwarding CFIUS-like legislation to 
review foreign direct investment in Estonia. The United States' 
approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC where our 
interests and values differ and cooperating with them when they align. 
If confirmed, I will support the Administration's policy on the PRC.

    Question. Since Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine 
this past February, the United States has provided the largest amount 
of security and financial assistance to Ukraine. While this assistance, 
if properly overseen and monitored, is a cost-effective way to 
safeguard American interests in Europe, our European allies and 
partners must also step up to assist Ukraine in fending off Putin's 
assault on their doorstep. In contrast to other European states, 
Estonia has gone above and beyond in providing military assistance to 
Ukraine. In this year alone, Estonia has provided 37.5 percent of its 
total defense budget to Ukraine. To compare, total U.S. assistance to 
Ukraine is equal to just 3.3 percent of our defense budget.

   What can the United States do, in concert with other European 
        allies, to ensure Estonia and other frontline states can 
        continue to provide military assistance to Ukraine while also 
        maintaining their own defensive readiness against a Russian 
        attack on their own borders?

    Answer. Estonia has been a steadfast defender--along with the 
United States and other European Allies and partners--of Ukraine's 
sovereignty and territorial integrity. If confirmed, I will work to 
ensure U.S. and Estonian policies toward Russia remain closely 
coordinated.
    Estonia faces continued security threats from Russia. To combat 
these threats our assistance focuses on bolstering NATO 
interoperability, deterrence, and defense, strengthening Estonian 
national defenses, and combating hybrid threats. Since 2016, the United 
States provided approximately $442 million in total security assistance 
to build Estonia's defensive capabilities and over $140 million in 
Foreign Military Financing this year. The resurgence of Russia's 
aggression has changed the priorities for these investments and 
resulted in Estonia's request to procure more capable military systems 
such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), as 
announced in June.
    The State Department has prioritized regional Foreign Military 
Financing for the Baltics to develop defensive capabilities, such as 
electronic and hybrid warfare, border security, and maritime and air 
domain awareness. If confirmed, I will continue to work with the 
Department of Defense and our Baltic Allies to align security 
assistance with our interests in enhancing collective security and 
confronting Russia's aggression.

    Question. Is there a role that Estonia and other Baltic states can 
play in ensuring that assistance provided to Ukraine is properly used 
and not siphoned off by corruption?

    Answer. The U.S. Plan to Counter Illicit Diversion of Certain 
Advanced Conventional Weapons in Eastern Europe is a comprehensive, 
whole-of-government approach to mitigate the risk of illicit diversion 
of advanced weapons systems transferred to Ukraine for its urgent 
defense needs. The Plan has three lines of effort:


   Bolster Accountability through safeguarding and accounting for arms 
        and munitions in Ukraine and neighboring countries when they 
        are transferred, stored, and deployed;

   Strengthen Borders by enhancing regional border management and 
        security; and

   Build Capacity of security forces, law enforcement, and border 
        control agencies in the region to deter, detect, and interdict 
        illicit arms trafficking.


    The Plan emphasizes the importance of cooperation with Allies and 
partners. The United States is coordinating closely with both NATO and 
the European Union, the latter of which is developing its own plan that 
will complement ours. As EU Member States, Estonia and its Baltic 
neighbors will be well positioned to support similar lines of effort 
and contribute to counter-diversion efforts. The United States can also 
work with Estonia to identify bilateral activities, as well as through 
NATO, to pursue these efforts.

    Question. Since February, the Chinese Communist Party has worked 
feverishly to create the facade that it's somehow not complicit in 
Putin's invasion of Ukraine. They do this by issuing statements 
emphasizing their support for a peaceful resolution and respect for 
sovereignty. In reality, the CCP continues to purchase Russian energy 
and do business with sanctioned Russian companies. Earlier this year, 
Latvia and Estonia both withdrew from the ``Cooperation between China 
and Central and Eastern European Countries Initiative,'' also known as 
the ``16+1,'' which the CCP uses to promote its views within Europe. In 
August, I sent a letter to the President, urging the Administration to 
support countries that leave the 16+1 and face a CCP economic blockade 
as a result.

   What consequences has the CCP tried to impose on Estonia since it 
        announced it was leaving the 16+1?

    Answer. Estonia, in coordination with Latvia, left the PRC's 
initiative originally known as 17+1 (from 2019-21), then 16+1 (2021-22 
after Lithuania departed), and now 14+1, having assessed it delivered 
little benefit. Estonia and the PRC have a limited economic 
relationship, with no observed fallout since the Estonia withdrawal. If 
confirmed, I will continue our close consultations with Estonia on this 
matter.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to working with Estonia to 
help convince other European countries to also withdraw from 16+1?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to working with Estonian 
officials and the Estonian business community on the challenges posed 
by the PRC, as well as working to increase U.S.-Estonia trade and 
economic ties. We must collaborate to promote shared economic growth 
and work together to ensure PRC investment meets global best practices 
for transparency and good governance, while warning our partners of the 
PRC's economic coercion and market distorting practices.

    Question. Without Russian language media outlets to amplify 
Moscow's propaganda, how do you assess Putin is attempting to threaten, 
intimidate, and manipulate ethnic Russians in Estonia?

    Answer. While the Kremlin's malign influence and disinformation has 
not gained a foothold in Estonia in recent years, it remains a 
persistent threat that requires vigilance. Estonian media platforms, 
both government-owned and privately-held, do produce Russian language 
news for TV and online to provide objective coverage.
    If confirmed, I will work with the Embassy team to continue its 
engagement with the Estonian Government to assess and address the 
threats of malign influence and disinformation posed by the Kremlin. I 
will also encourage my team to continue its use of public diplomacy 
tools to expand digital and media literacy programs and to empower 
local opinion leaders who can raise awareness of these threats. 
Finally, I will ensure that we work in coordination with the Government 
of Estonia, should these threats become a new reality.

    Question. In your view, is the United States effectively countering 
Moscow's propaganda? And how would you support this work, if confirmed?

    Answer. The United States is using the full range of diplomatic, 
public diplomacy, and foreign assistance tools to effectively counter 
the Kremlin's disinformation in Estonia, as well as across Europe. Our 
work to declassify and expose Russia's plans for a wider invasion of 
Ukraine last February is a clear example of how we have effectively 
limited Russia's ability to manipulate the information space. We 
continue to publicly expose the Kremlin's disinformation and propaganda 
ecosystem through our public webpage state.gov/disarming-disinformation
    If confirmed, I would continue the effective cooperation between 
the U.S. and Estonian Governments and Estonian media and civil society 
on all fronts, including information-sharing, public diplomacy, and 
further increasing the Estonian public's resiliency against Russia's 
disinformation through media literacy programs and support for Estonia-
based Russian-language media.

War in Ukraine
    Question. How will you work with the Government of Bulgaria to 
assist their efforts to host and provide support to Ukrainian refugees?

    Answer. Since Russia's unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 
Bulgarians have generously opened their hearts and homes to refugees 
from Ukraine. According to Bulgarian Government figures, as of early 
November, over 900,000 refugees from Ukraine have entered Bulgaria 
since the start of the war. Over 55,000 Ukrainian citizens remain in 
Bulgaria, with 87 percent of them women and children. The United 
States, through the Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration, has 
provided humanitarian assistance funding to UNHCR, IOM, UNICEF, and the 
WHO for their support to Ukrainian refugees in Bulgaria. If confirmed 
as Ambassador, I will continue to prioritize these and other avenues of 
support and ensure that U.S. assistance is used resourcefully and 
effectively.

    Question. As Ambassador, how would you work with the Government of 
Bulgaria to assess their needs and help provide backfill for military 
stocks that have been donated Ukraine?

    Answer. Bulgaria was quick to condemn Russia's full-scale invasion 
of Ukraine, supported sanctions against Russia, and provided various 
forms of humanitarian aid to Ukraine and refugees from Ukraine. On 
November 3, Bulgaria's parliament passed a resolution to provide lethal 
military assistance to Ukraine, reversing Bulgaria's earlier position 
which limited the Government to providing non-lethal military 
assistance only. Bulgaria can now expand the scope of its assistance 
beyond humanitarian aid and repair of Ukrainian heavy military 
equipment. If confirmed, I will work closely with our Bulgarian 
partners to identify Bulgaria's defense requirements, Bulgarian 
military assets that could bolster Ukraine's defense against Russia's 
unprovoked war, and the forms of support that the United States and our 
allies can provide to Bulgaria to facilitate such support of Ukraine.

Black Sea
    Question. The war on Ukraine has also given increased attention to 
the Black Sea. Bulgaria, along with Romania and Turkey, are Black Sea 
littoral states who are also members of NATO. The other three littoral 
states, Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia, are not NATO members.

   Do you believe that the U.S. has placed enough importance on the 
        Black Sea region?

    Answer. The Black Sea region will continue to be an area of great 
geostrategic importance, and there is no question that the biggest 
threat to the region is Russia's continued aggression. While more work 
remains to be done, the United States and NATO have expanded our 
presence in littoral countries before and since Russia's unprovoked 
full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this year, NATO established a 
multinational battlegroup to which the United States contributes a 
Stryker armored company. The U.S. Department of State spearheaded the 
Black Sea Maritime Domain Awareness program in 2019, providing Foreign 
Military Financing allocation across Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, and 
Ukraine to bolster regional security and cooperation. The U.S. 
Department of Defense has built upon this program, and it remains a key 
security cooperation line of effort. If confirmed, I am committed to 
working with Congress, the interagency, and our Allies and partners 
within the Black Sea region as we continue to address the region's 
needs.

    Question. What are the most effective ways Bulgaria can further its 
defense cooperation with the U.S. and within NATO?

    Answer. Since joining NATO in 2004, Bulgaria has proven itself an 
enthusiastic Ally proactively contributing to NATO operations. To date, 
21,000 Bulgarian troops have participated in various NATO missions. 
Earlier this year, Bulgaria agreed to host one of four new 
multinational NATO battlegroups, in which U.S. forces play a key role, 
to bolster NATO's deterrence and defense posture along its eastern 
flank after Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, 
Bulgaria hosts, staffs, and funds a NATO Force Integration Unit and the 
NATO Crisis Management and Disaster Response Center of Excellence. 
Bulgaria understands burden sharing and is willing to do more as its 
capabilities and economy develop. The United States and Bulgaria have a 
strong history of security cooperation and training, especially through 
named exercises with US EUCOM, NATO, and the 30-year Tennessee State 
Partnership Program (SPP). The United States Army also has a rotational 
infantry battalion conducting training at the Novo Selo Training Area. 
If confirmed, I will work with U.S. interagency partners and Bulgaria 
to build upon this progress, bolstering NATO interoperability through 
joint training, regional infrastructure development, and foreign 
military sales to trusted Allies.

    Question. How will you respond to Bulgaria's requests for a 
stronger forward presence from the U.S. and NATO?

    Answer. Through a 2006 Defense Cooperation Agreement, the Bulgarian 
Government granted the United States access to several military 
facilities. Since 2006, the facilities have been used for hundreds of 
military-to-military engagements of various sizes. Earlier this year, 
Bulgaria agreed to host one of four new multinational NATO 
battlegroups, in which U.S. forces play a key role, to bolster NATO's 
deterrence and defense posture along its eastern flank after Putin's 
full-scale invasion of Ukraine. If confirmed, I will partner with the 
U.S. Department of Defense to ensure that we honor our commitments made 
in the 2022 Madrid NATO Summit declaration to provide consistent 
rotations of U.S. troops in the region.

Economic Engagement and Energy
    Question. How will you support economic engagement between Bulgaria 
and U.S. business sectors?

    Answer. If confirmed, my top priority in the economic sphere is to 
ensure a fair and transparent playing field for U.S. businesses. 
Increased transparency, predictability, and stability in the investment 
climate are key. I will also, if confirmed, promote U.S. exports and 
help U.S. businesses identify and take advantage of economic 
opportunities in areas such as agriculture, education, energy, defense, 
technology, and water, among others. This includes encouraging more 
U.S. trade delegation visits to Bulgaria, and vice versa.

    Question. What are the perceived risks to western investment, and 
how can they be mitigated?

    Answer. Greater transparency and improved corporate governance 
would benefit not only U.S. firms that consider investing in Bulgaria, 
but also the Bulgarian economy as a whole. Increased predictability, 
stability, and rule of law enforcement in the investment climate are 
key. Bulgaria can enhance its appeal to U.S. businesses by improving in 
these domains.

    Question. What sectors do you see as potential areas of growth for 
U.S.-Bulgarian business ties?

    Answer. Russia's weaponization of energy supplies has motivated 
several European states to seek out more reliable suppliers, and the 
United States has an important role to play here. If confirmed, I will 
prioritize supporting partnerships with U.S. firms that bolster 
Bulgaria's energy security and its adoption of low-carbon energy 
sources and the technologies that facilitate this transition. 
Bulgaria's market presents broader opportunities for partnerships with 
U.S. firms in areas as diverse as agriculture, education, healthcare, 
defense, and technology, among others.

    Question. What role, if any, do you see the U.S. Development 
Finance Corporation playing in stimulating western investment in 
Bulgaria?

    Answer. Bulgaria enthusiastically welcomed the U.S. Development 
Financing Corporation's (DFC) announcement of $300 million in financing 
to support the Three Seas Initiative. As a Black Sea littoral state, 
Bulgaria will continue to seek opportunities to partner with the DFC in 
the coming years to bring more infrastructure investment to the region. 
Investments that promote regional energy and commercial integration 
will benefit Bulgaria and broader regional prosperity.

    Question. What can the U.S. do to help Bulgaria maintain sufficient 
energy supplies as it faces cuts from Russia?

    Answer. Bulgaria has taken positive steps toward energy 
diversification, particularly since Russia cut off natural gas supplies 
in April after the Bulgarian Government refused to pay Gazprom in 
rubles. The completion of the Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria, which 
facilitates natural gas imports from Azerbaijan, was a major 
achievement in this regard. More remains to be done, from securing 
further liquified natural gas supplies to procuring nuclear fuel that 
does not rely upon Russian inputs. If confirmed, I am committed to 
supporting Bulgaria's efforts to strengthen energy security, including 
with the help of U.S. companies' technology and know-how.

    Question. How will you work with your State Department and 
interagency colleagues to coordinate U.S. economic engagement with 
Bulgaria across the Balkans and greater Eastern European region?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will advocate for continuously deepening 
regional economic integration between Bulgaria and the Eastern European 
region. Improving energy supply interconnectivity, as well as 
commercial and logistical linkages, will require close coordination 
with U.S. interagency partners such as the U.S. Department of Commerce 
and the U.S. Department of Energy, while also leveraging the expertise 
of the U.S. Development Finance Corporation and U.S. Export-Import 
Bank. Successful economic engagement across the region will also hinge 
on effective partnership with Bulgaria and the EU. The United States 
has strongly supported North Macedonia's and Albania's integration into 
the EU and believes the future of the Western Balkans is squarely 
within the EU. The EU accession process promotes economic growth 
through market integration and heightens prosperity throughout the 
region.

State Department Management and Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. Missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. 

   What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission Sofia?

    Answer. The staff of the U.S. Embassy in Sofia demonstrated 
resilience, professionalism, and a spirit of service throughout what I 
hope will prove to have been the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I 
am grateful for their unwavering service. If confirmed, ensuring the 
safety and well-being of the Embassy Sofia team and their families will 
be among my most important and sacred duties, and I will be firmly 
committed to fostering an environment where colleagues feel valued and 
their contributions to our national security and prosperity are 
recognized.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Sofia?

    Answer. I have had the honor of representing the United States 
overseas for over twenty years of my thirty-five years in the Foreign 
Service, serving as Chief of Mission in two very different countries 
for six of those years. While holding these positions of leadership, I 
have committed to bringing integrity, honesty, and energy to my 
engagements with Embassy staff. If confirmed, I will continue to apply 
this philosophy while holding regular consultations with colleagues at 
all levels to seek feedback on Mission morale. I understand that 
Russia's unprovoked February invasion of Ukraine has elevated the pace 
and volume of work at U.S. Embassy Sofia, and I hold the greatest 
respect for the dedication demonstrated by the team there.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Sofia?

    Answer. If confirmed, I am committed to proactively engaging with 
all U.S. Embassy Sofia colleagues to ensure we hold a shared 
understanding of our Mission's strategic priorities. It will be my 
responsibility to guarantee that all in the Mission understand their 
role in advancing these priorities and receive the support they need to 
consistently deliver on the responsibilities before them. In my 
experience, colleagues are most engaged when they grasp the broader 
impact of their work and share responsibility for the Mission's 
success. If confirmed, it will be my intent to actively foster such an 
environment through open, honest communication with U.S. direct hires, 
their families, and locally employed staff.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. As a Chief of Mission, I aim to foster a collaborative 
environment. If confirmed, I will do my utmost to encourage all members 
of the U.S. Embassy team to take ownership of the challenges we 
confront and think creatively in developing sustainable solutions. I am 
also an advocate for open communication and recognizing the 
contributions of individuals. This includes ensuring that colleagues 
have opportunities to develop skills to advance their careers.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. Absolutely not. It is never appropriate to berate 
subordinates, either in public or private. Such behavior undermines 
morale, reduces productivity, and is never acceptable from any manager.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work closely with the Deputy Chief of 
Mission to ensure the effective management of U.S. Embassy Sofia. I 
will develop a relationship of trust and honest communication. I will 
mentor and provide the appropriate tools to the deputy to serve as the 
Mission's chief operating officer and ensure they can step in for me if 
I am not available. If confirmed, I will work closely with my Deputy 
Chief of Mission to foster their success.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. I see the role of the Deputy Chief of Mission as a chief 
operating officer who complements the relative strengths of an 
ambassador. The exact division of labor would be determined based on 
the interests and skills of the Deputy Chief of Mission and the needs 
of the Mission.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Having previously served as the Principal Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of the Bureau of Global Talent Management, I believe it is 
important to provide employees with accurate, timely, and constructive 
feedback. If confirmed, I will ensure all U.S. direct hires and locally 
employed staff fully appreciate the importance of fair, transparent, 
and objective measures of employee performance and are appropriately 
acknowledged for their successes.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes. Clear, accurate, and direct communication is critical 
to maintaining a high functioning and trusting work environment.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Greece [Bulgaria].

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our Embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. As a leader and a diplomat, I wholeheartedly believe that 
we must engage with as many local actors and organizations as possible 
to advance U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives. We 
also have the responsibility to balance these needs with an accurate 
assessment of risks. If confirmed, I pledge to work closely with the 
Regional Security Office and my management team to keep our employees 
safe while giving them maximum flexibility to travel the country and 
meet people. I intend to interact with a wide array of Bulgarians 
around the country and will encourage my team to follow by example.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will encourage all employees at Mission 
Sofia to get outside the Mission walls, meet with the local population, 
and travel widely throughout the country to learn as much as possible 
about local issues. We will balance all security considerations 
appropriately. My understanding is that the team in Sofia regularly 
travels throughout the country, and I intend to continue to support for 
these efforts.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in 
Bulgaria?

    Answer. Bulgarians are eager to engage with the West but continue 
to maintain a strong historic affinity for Russia, whom many view as 
having liberated them from 500 years of Ottoman rule. While younger 
Bulgarians view the United States positively, favorable public opinion 
of the United States as a whole is considerably lower than that of 
Russia--even in the aftermath of Russia's full-scale invasion of 
Ukraine. As has been widely reported, Bulgarians are heavily 
susceptible to Russia's propaganda and malign influence. This situation 
is exacerbated by a weak and highly concentrated media environment that 
is heavily influenced by oligarchs and entrenched political and 
economic interests, and marked by frequent self-censorship. Bulgarian 
Government and civil society actors have shown increasing willingness 
to counter disinformation and strengthen the media landscape, although 
efforts to date have had limited effect. Working closely with the U.S. 
interagency and with Bulgarian and international partners, the Embassy 
is deeply engaged to address these deficits in the public diplomacy 
landscape and to reinforce, at every turn, Bulgaria's western 
orientation. Cultural and educational programming that underscores our 
shared values is integral to this effort.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. While younger Bulgarians view the United States positively, 
favorable public opinion of the United States as a whole is 
considerably lower than that of Russia--even in the aftermath of 
Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. NATO faces a formidable public 
opinion challenge, with a significant percentage of Bulgaria's 
population believing NATO and the West are to blame for Russia's war 
against Ukraine and opting for ``neutrality'' to avoid being drawn into 
the conflict. Bulgarians are heavily susceptible to Russia's malign 
influence, and according to recent research, Kremlin propaganda has 
increased tenfold since Russia's February 24 full-scale invasion of 
Ukraine. This situation is exacerbated by a weak and highly 
concentrated media environment that is heavily influenced by oligarchs 
and entrenched political and economic interests, and marked by frequent 
self-censorship. Bulgaria also lacks a robust civil society, and 
efforts by civil society organizations and the Government to counter 
disinformation and strengthen the media environment have had limited 
effect to date. If confirmed, I will continue the Embassy's engagement 
with the Bulgarian Government and civil society to ensure a unified and 
proactive approach to countering Russia's disinformation and to 
strengthening democratic institutions to solidify Bulgaria's long-term 
orientation towards the West.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country Mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. I understand that Embassy Sofia's Mission objectives align 
closely with top Department and Administration priorities--
strengthening democracy, combating corruption, advancing shared 
security, and building prosperity--and the Public Diplomacy team, as at 
all U.S. Embassies, creatively tailors and deploys high-level USG 
messaging to local audiences. If confirmed, I will work with the Public 
Affairs section to ensure a unified approach to highlighting key U.S. 
messages and policies in Bulgaria. The Public Affairs section routinely 
engages in a wide range of public outreach--through traditional and 
social media, and in-person engagements--to inform and engage 
Bulgarians about U.S. policy; promote Embassy activities and events; 
enhance the image of the United States; and provide information on 
security, voting, and other topics of interest to U.S. citizens.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, there is nothing I will take more 
seriously than the health and security of the people who will be 
working with me.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Sofia personnel?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I commit to sharing what information I 
can within the bounds of privacy and security concerns with Mission 
Sofia personnel.

    Question. In the 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report, Bulgaria was 
identified as Tier 2 Watch List for a lack of sustained efforts to 
combat trafficking and hold traffickers accountable. How will you work 
with the host government and civil society actors to address these 
issues if you are confirmed as Ambassador?

    Answer. Human trafficking is a multifaceted crime and a challenging 
problem faced by all countries. Bulgaria remains one of the largest 
source countries of trafficking victims in the EU. I understand Embassy 
Sofia is working closely with Bulgaria's National Commission for 
Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings and relevant ministries to 
encourage further progress. Embassy officials promote a victim-centered 
approach to trafficking in persons by the Commission and other 
government institutions such as the prosecution service and the law 
enforcement authorities. The U.S. Government has also participated in 
training for Bulgarian officials on issues ranging from collecting 
evidence to identifying victims of trafficking. If confirmed, I will 
ensure resources are made available to continue our partnership with 
Bulgaria to prevent and mitigate human trafficking.

    Question. Do you commit to reporting accurate information as it 
pertains to the reality of the trafficking situation in Bulgaria?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will ensure we base our reporting on 
the trafficking situation in Bulgaria on the best information available 
to us. Only through transparent, objective reporting can we identify 
the necessary steps to improve enforcement.

    Question. In the 2021 International Religious Freedom report, 
Bulgaria was identified as generally tolerant of religious freedom but 
reports of harassment of religious minorities were clear. What is your 
assessment of this particular issue and if confirmed, how will you work 
with the office of the Ambassador-at-Large for international religious 
freedom to bolster religious freedom in-country?

    Answer. Bulgaria's constitution provides for freedom of religion 
and conscience. Nonetheless, instances of threatening behavior and 
rhetoric against religious minorities persist. I understand that 
Embassy Sofia officials have met with relevant government officials, 
including representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' 
Directorate for Human Rights, the Council of Ministers' Directorate for 
Religious Affairs, Office of the Ombudsman, Commission for Protection 
against Discrimination, and local governments regularly to discuss 
cases of religious discrimination, harassment of religious minorities, 
and their efforts to promote interfaith dialogue. Embassy Sofia 
officials have also developed strong relationships with religious 
leaders and communities across the country and are engaged with them on 
these issues. If confirmed, I will closely coordinate with the 
Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom and maintain 
dialogue with Bulgarian interlocutors representing the Government, 
religious, and civil society communities to encourage tolerance and 
interfaith dialogue.

    Question. In the 2021 Human Rights Report, Bulgaria was identified 
as having committed significant human rights abuses including abuse of 
freedom of assembly, speech and media, lack of judicial independence, 
corruption, violence against children, and more.

   If confirmed, what steps will you take to address these instances 
        with the host government?

    Answer. Human rights reform is a long-term, multifaceted, and 
challenging process. Bulgaria has taken some steps to build a more 
open, inclusive, just, and prosperous society. More needs to be done, 
however. As noted in the most recent Human Rights Report for Bulgaria, 
the United States is concerned about reports of the intimidation of 
journalists by individuals with political and economic power and 
incidents of violence directed at journalists. If confirmed, I will 
speak out publicly and privately on the importance of protecting media 
freedom and editorial independence and encouraging responsible 
journalism. If confirmed, I will also prioritize continued, regular 
engagement with the host government to identify critical areas for 
improvement and provide U.S. support and technical assistance as 
appropriate to efforts at reform.

    Question. How will you direct your Embassy to work with civil 
society organizations to improve the human rights situation on the 
ground?

    Answer. If confirmed, I am committed to working closely with civil 
society to make tangible progress toward improved human rights 
practices in Bulgaria. Department of State programs currently support 
capacity-building for civil society, law enforcement, and members of 
the judiciary. I understand that Embassy Sofia has also supported 
progress by engaging civil society and speaking publicly about the 
importance of reforms. If confirmed, I would like to continue our 
capacity-building programs and encourage my team to engage frequently 
and at all levels with Bulgarian civil society actors.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
        Submitted to Hon. Kenneth Merten by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. As we speak, the Party is 
cracking down on unprecedented student protests across the country. 
With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry, the CCP 
could stop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. The President made it clear in his National Security 
Strategy that the People's Republic of China (PRC) harbors the 
intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international 
order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its 
benefit. The PRC is a strategic competitor, and Secretary Blinken has 
committed to align our efforts with partners and allies and compete 
with the PRC to defend our interests and build our vision for the 
future.
    If confirmed, I will seek opportunities to strengthen our 
cooperation with Bulgaria to uphold shared values. This includes 
encouraging Bulgaria to adopt an investment screening mechanism.

    Question. Does the CCP undertake any activities that are beneficial 
to U.S. interests?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors, as the President 
laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United States does not 
seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our allies and partners have an 
opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in a way that 
influences their behavior even as we compete with them. The United 
States' approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC 
where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them when 
they align. If confirmed, I will continue working closely with Bulgaria 
to promote our shared values of democracy and support for the rules-
based order.

    Question. Do you believe there are any areas within which the CCP 
would constructively work with the United States in good faith?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors, as the President 
laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United States does not 
seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our allies and partners have an 
opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in a way that 
influences their behavior even as we compete with them. The United 
States' approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC 
where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them when 
they align. If confirmed, I will continue working closely with Bulgaria 
to promote our shared values of democracy and support for the rules-
based order.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China in 
Bulgaria?

    Answer. As the United States National Security Strategy makes clear 
and as Secretary Blinken said in October, the PRC is the greatest 
geopolitical challenge that we face because it is the only competitor 
with the intent and increasingly the capability to remake the 
international order. And Beijing's actions suggest PRC officials have 
the intention to do so. While Bulgaria maintains friendly political 
relations with the PRC and remains open to PRC investment, the 
Bulgarian Government notably signed a Joint Declaration on 5G Security 
with the United States in October 2020. The United States' approach 
towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC where our interests 
and values differ and cooperating with them when they align. If 
confirmed, I will support the Administration's policy on the PRC.

    Question. This past week, protesters gathered in several Bulgarian 
cities against the Bulgarian Government's decision to provide military 
medical training to Ukrainian soldiers. While the protests were small 
in scale, we can only expect protests like these to continue in Europe 
and even in the United States as Putin's war drags on and the West does 
not have a clearly communicated objective for assistance to Ukraine. It 
is imperative that European countries especially maintain the will and 
unity in providing assistance to Ukraine, as the United States must 
primarily focus on the threat from the CCP in the Indo-Pacific.

   To what extent do you believe that these recent protests reflect 
        genuine fatigue and dissatisfaction with ongoing Western 
        assistance to Ukraine rather than as the result of a Russian 
        influence campaign?

    Answer. While Bulgaria maintains cultural and historical affinities 
with Russia, the Bulgarian Government's response to Russia's February 
invasion of Ukraine affirms its status as a stalwart NATO Ally. 
Bulgarian citizens have opened their hearts and their homes to refugees 
from Ukraine as the Government supported sanctions against Russia and 
authorized the supply of humanitarian aid and military equipment repair 
for Ukraine. On November 3, Bulgaria's parliament overwhelmingly passed 
a resolution to provide lethal military assistance to Ukraine. I cannot 
profess to know what inspires individuals to protest--a right protected 
in Bulgarian law--but we do know that Russia is actively engaged in a 
disinformation campaign aimed at undermining Bulgarian democracy and 
diminishing public support for the Euro-Atlantic partnership, taking 
advantage of longstanding cultural ties between the countries as well 
as the economic challenges that are, in fact, exacerbated by Russia's 
full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to ensure that the 
Bulgarian Government is equipped to effectively communicate to the 
Bulgarian people the objectives and necessity of providing continued 
European assistance to Ukraine?

    Answer. Many stakeholders, including the U.S. Government, the 
Government of Bulgaria, and European allies work to emphasize a 
positive narrative about transatlantic values. This lets Bulgarians, 
who chose to join NATO and the EU, judge for themselves the relative 
value of the messages promoted in the Kremlin's propaganda regarding 
the war in Ukraine and the necessity of supporting Ukraine's self-
defense. The U.S. Government works closely with NATO and EU partners on 
a variety of initiatives that build strategic communications capacity 
for the Bulgarian Government. Delivering fair, objective reporting to 
the Bulgarian public has become more critical since Russia's 
unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine. We need more of this to 
help counter the Kremlin's propaganda machine. If confirmed, I will 
continue our capacity-building programs for the Bulgarian Government, 
civil society partners, and independent media--including training that 
applies U.S. best practices in fact-checking, investigative reporting, 
digital and multimedia communications, and financial sustainability.

    Question. When the CCP first announced its pernicious Belt and Road 
Initiative in Europe, Bulgaria was among its most enthusiastic 
adopters. Bulgaria announced a strategic partnership with China in 2018 
and even hosted a meeting of China's 16+1 initiative, which it uses to 
spread its influence in Central and Eastern Europe. Since then, 
Bulgaria has cooled its support for CCP initiatives. It has stopped 
sending senior government officials to meetings of 16+1 and, to date 
has received the second lowest amount of Chinese lending in central and 
eastern Europe.

   Former Prime Minister Boyko Borissov last week was given the 
        mandate to form a government. His last tenure in office saw the 
        strengthening of Bulgarian-Chinese relations. Should we expect 
        Bulgaria to resume a pro-CCP course under another Borissov 
        tenure?

    Answer. Since it joined the EU in 2007, Bulgaria has garnered 
increasing interest from PRC investors, but concerns about EU 
regulations, lack of state guarantees, and Bulgaria's reluctance to 
take on debt impede significant PRC investments. Currently, PRC 
investments in Bulgaria include wind energy, telecommunications, IT, 
and agriculture. Bulgaria has friendly political relations with the 
PRC, but Sino-Bulgarian trade remains relatively low for the region. In 
February 2021, under the Borissov government, Bulgaria sent its tourism 
minister rather than its prime minister to the PRC-Central and Eastern 
European Countries summit (CEEC or ``16+1,'' currently ``14+1'').
    If confirmed, I will continue to convey to Bulgarian interlocutors 
the risks involved with PRC investment and the broader utility of 
adopting an investment screening mechanism in line with EU directives.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to ensure that Bulgaria 
does not fall victim to the debt trap diplomacy of the CCP's Belt and 
Road Initiative, as have Sri Lanka and other counties?

    Answer. Bulgaria is the poorest state in the European Union but 
boasts strong macroeconomic fundamentals, with a history of steady 
growth, an ironclad peg of its currency, the Lev, to the Euro, and 
fiscal discipline. Bulgaria also has one of Europe's lowest budget 
deficits and debt-to-GDP ratios. Bulgaria maintains friendly political 
relations with the PRC, but concerns regarding EU regulations, lack of 
state guarantees, and Bulgaria's reluctance to take on debt impede 
significant PRC investments. If confirmed, I will advocate for U.S. 
commercial and investment entities that are well-positioned to serve as 
reliable partners of Bulgaria while making market-driven decisions.

         Submitted to Hon. Kenneth Merten by Senator Todd Young

    Question. If confirmed, what does a ``Chief of Mission who leads, 
manages, and safeguards'' look like in practice to you?

    Answer. Based on my experience serving as the Ambassador in Haiti 
and Croatia, I believe a Chief of Mission must bring integrity, 
honesty, and energy to all of their engagements with Embassy staff, 
host government officials, and the broader, host country community. 
Effective leaders create a vision for their team, entrust staff with 
the resources to execute on those priorities, and remain vigilant in 
creating and preserving an appropriate environment where this work can 
be done. This simple formula has served me well no matter the size of 
the Mission I led, the scope of resources with which I was entrusted, 
or the complexity of issues that defined the bilateral relationship. It 
is a philosophy that I leaned heavily upon in Haiti, where I oversaw 
the United States' on-the-ground efforts to provide immediate relief 
after the 2010 earthquake and subsequent evacuation efforts, and one 
that I will continue to abide by, if confirmed.

    Question. Noting your past experience as Principal Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for the Bureau of Global Talent Management, did you witness 
any particularly positive examples of leadership during the pandemic 
that you could model? Or conversely, can you provide any examples of 
Missions that needed better support and leadership during that time?

    Answer. The COVID-19 pandemic was an unprecedented challenge for 
the global community and a stress test for the resilience, creativity, 
and agility of the dedicated public servants of the Department of 
State, whether serving abroad or in the United States. As the Principal 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Global Talent Management 
throughout much of the pandemic, I witnessed countless instances of 
exemplary leadership at all levels from which I drew inspiration and 
the confidence that we would adapt and overcome. From the early stages 
of the pandemic that required our posts to support the safe evacuation 
of American citizens, to the rapid implementation of technological 
solutions that enabled many of our colleagues to work safely from home, 
I was particularly impressed by the commitment that our entry- and mid-
level public servants brought to bear on these challenges. Their 
collective, innovative responses to the hardships brought by the 
pandemic continue to give me great confidence in the Department's 
future corps of leaders.

    Question. With your wealth of experience both leading Missions and 
supporting the Department's personnel from Washington, what is the 
biggest challenge to the Department's efforts to hire and retain a 
qualified and diverse workforce?

    Answer. The goal of creating and maintaining a qualified and 
diverse work force is one worth diligently pursuing. I believe a more 
diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible (DEIA) Department leads 
to a stronger, smarter, and more creative foreign policy, and one 
delivered by a diplomatic corps that looks like the America it 
represents. In March 2022, the Department of State submitted its five-
year DEIA Strategic Plan to the Office of Personnel Management. 
Important elements of the plan include an effort to promote recruitment 
activity across the diversity spectrum, implement a recruitment 
strategy that targets underrepresented groups, and examine the hiring 
process to address barriers to entry for diverse candidates. These 
efforts will advance our efforts to hire and retain a workforce that 
reflects the diversity and talents we will need to succeed in 21st 
century diplomacy.

      Submitted to Kathleen Ann Kavalec by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has had huge effects on 
Ukraine's neighbors, not least Romania. Hundreds of thousands of 
refugees have flowed through Romania; many have settled there 
temporarily. The conflict

   Do you believe that the support provided to Romania in the spheres 
        of humanitarian assistance, energy, and defense has been 
        adequate? Why?

    Answer. Since Russia's further invasion of Ukraine, the United 
States has greatly increased support for Romania. The Department of 
Defense tripled the number of U.S. troops in Romania and President 
Biden announced at the NATO summit in June that the United States will 
headquarter a Brigade Combat Team in Romania. The Department of State, 
through the Bureau for Populations, Refugees, and Migration, has given 
over $40 million to international organizations in Romania that are 
helping to process the entry and transit of refugees from Ukraine 
fleeing Putin's violence. On energy, the United States and Romania have 
a strong partnership on energy diversification and are cooperating on 
nuclear energy. If confirmed, I pledge to work with the Romanian 
Government, my U.S. Government counterparts, and the private sector to 
assess Romania's needs and ensure that U.S. assistance is impactful and 
spent well.

    Question. In what areas has international support to Romania not 
been adequate?

    Answer. Russia's unprovoked war on Ukraine has stretched the 
resources of many of our European allies, including Romania. If 
confirmed, I pledge to advocate for appropriate support to Romania and 
ensure that such support is utilized effectively.

    Question. How will you work with the Government of Romania to 
assist their efforts to host and provide support to Ukrainian refugees?

    Answer. Romania has welcomed more than two and a half million 
refugees from Ukraine, 85,000 of whom remain in the country. Romania 
has created a significant humanitarian assistance apparatus to 
facilitate the entry, processing, and transit for the large number of 
refugees who have entered since Russia's full-scale invasion. Through 
the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, 
the United States has provided more than $40 million to international 
humanitarian organizations in Romania supporting refugees from Ukraine. 
If confirmed as Ambassador, I will continue to prioritize these and 
other avenues of support and ensure that any U.S. assistance is 
impactful and spent well.

    Question. As Ambassador, how would you work with the Government of 
Romania to assess their needs and help provide backfill for military 
stocks that have been donated to Ukraine?

    Answer. Romania has been a strong backer of international efforts 
to support Ukraine. Russia's unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine 
has stretched Romania's resources, as it has the resources of many 
countries in the region. Romania would benefit from U.S. assistance, 
above all in Foreign Military Financing. Romania received $86.3 million 
in the second Ukraine supplemental to help deter and defend against the 
increased threat from Russia. Assistance would also be useful to 
address disinformation, bolster civil society, and fight corruption. If 
confirmed as Ambassador, I would advocate for appropriate U.S. support 
for Romania, and I will ensure that any U.S. assistance is impactful 
and spent well.

    Question. The war on Ukraine has also given increased attention to 
the Black Sea. Romania, along with Bulgaria and Turkey, are Black Sea 
littoral states who are also members of NATO. The other three littoral 
states, Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia, are not NATO members.

   Do you believe that the U.S. has placed enough importance on the 
        Black Sea region?

    Answer. There is no question that the biggest threat to the Black 
Sea region is Russia's continued aggression. I understand the 
Administration is working across the inter-agency to develop an 
approach that addresses the United States' vital long-term interests in 
the region. The first priority must be to ensure Ukraine prevails in 
this war. At the same time, the Administration can continue and deepen 
our already multifaceted engagement in the region. The United States 
and NATO have expanded our presence in Black Sea littoral countries 
since February 24. The United States is headquartering a new Brigade 
Combat Team in Romania. The administration has tripled the number of 
U.S. troops in Romania since the start of the war and has redoubled 
efforts to support Romania's defense modernization.
    I understand the Administration is also already thinking longer-
term about how to ensure a Black Sea region that is free and 
prosperous. The United States is working with our Black Sea partners to 
diversify energy sources away from a reliance on Russian oil and gas. 
If confirmed, I commit to continuing to work with Congress, the 
interagency, and our Allies and partners within the Black Sea region as 
we continue to address the region's needs.

    Question. What are the most effective ways Romania can further its 
defense cooperation with the U.S. and NATO?

    Answer. Romania is a stalwart NATO Ally, a frontline country in 
Russia's aggression in Ukraine, a member of the Global Coalition to 
Defeat ISIS, and a consistent supporter of our highest-priority 
international security policies. Romania meets its fair share of common 
defense burdens by consistently allocating 2 percent of its GDP to 
defense spending--and pledged an increase to 2.5 percent in 2023. 
Romania has 123 active Foreign Military Sales cases valued at $4.7 
billion and currently hosts approximately 3,000 U.S. military personnel 
in country, including a rotational Brigade Combat Team announced by 
President Biden at the June NATO Summit in Madrid. Romania also hosts a 
NATO Battlegroup led by the French, which was approved at the March 24 
NATO Summit. If confirmed, I will seek to deepen our already strong 
security partnership in the face of Russia's further invasion of 
Ukraine.

    Question. How will you respond to Romania's requests for a stronger 
forward presence from the U.S. and NATO?

    Answer. I understand that Romania has been vocal about the need for 
a stronger, more unified EU-NATO stance against Russia's encroachment 
in the region. The administration's recent decision to headquarter a 
Brigade Combat Team in Romania underscores U.S. resolve to anchor our 
presence on NATO's Eastern Flank. The United States continues to work 
with our Allies at NATO on force posture positioning as the security 
situation on the ground evolves.

    Question. How will you support economic engagement between Romanian 
and U.S. business sectors?

    Answer. The Romanian market has excellent potential and Romanians 
are generally pro-American and very favorably disposed to U.S. products 
and services. Romania welcomes all forms of foreign investment. Its 
strategic location, membership in the EU, sizable domestic market, 
relatively well-educated workforce, competitive wages, and abundant 
natural resources make it a desirable, relatively low-cost foothold for 
accessing the wider EU, Central Asia, and Near East markets. If I am 
confirmed as ambassador, promoting greater economic engagement and 
assisting U.S. businesses in Romania will be a top priority. Business 
plays an important role in fostering prosperity and bringing people 
together. I will be personally involved in advocating and supporting 
our companies to promote prosperity for the American people.

    Question. What are the perceived risks to western investment, and 
how can they be mitigated?

    Answer. I understand that a number of challenges to the business 
climate persist, despite reforms and some improvements. Romania has 
made significant strides in combatting corruption, but this remains an 
ongoing challenge. The Romanian Government still plays an oversized 
role in the economy in terms of employment and ownership of assets. 
State-owned enterprises shape many sectors as dominant customers, 
suppliers, or competitors. If I am confirmed as ambassador, assisting 
U.S. businesses in Romania will be a top priority. I will work closely 
with the U.S. Department of Commerce, if confirmed, to ensure that the 
full resources of the U.S. Government are used to advocate for and 
support U.S. companies to promote prosperity for the American people.

    Question. What sectors do you see as potential areas of growth for 
U.S.-Romania business ties?

    Answer. U.S. firms have invested billions of dollars in Romania 
since the fall of communism, and there are many opportunities for 
greater bilateral trade and investment--especially in the defense, 
energy, IT, transportation, film, and agricultural sectors. If 
confirmed, I will encourage Romania to implement policies and practices 
to improve its business and investment climate, foster a stronger 
environment for entrepreneurship and innovation, and unlock its 
potential. Romania has enormous economic potential and a positive 
economic story to tell. If confirmed, I will work to improve Romania's 
visibility to U.S. exporters and investors.

    Question. What role, if any, do you see the U.S. Development 
Finance Corporation playing in stimulating western investment in 
Romania?

    Answer. The U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is an 
important partner in stimulating investment overseas, including in 
Romania. It is my understanding that the DFC can play a role in the 
context of the Three Seas Initiative (3SI), which aims to strengthen 
North-South infrastructure on the EU's eastern flank in energy, 
transportation, and digital infrastructure, as well as outside of the 
3SI context, directly in bilateral financing. Romania is an active 
participant in 3SI and will host the 2023 summit. If confirmed, I 
commit to using the full range of U.S. Government tools, including 
collaboration with the DFC, to advance our economic goals in Romania.

    Question. While Romania has a lower dependence on Russia for its 
energy supplies, how can the U.S. help further increase its energy 
security?

    Answer. Romania is a strong proponent of energy security in Europe 
and has prioritized support for vulnerable neighbors like Moldova since 
the beginning of Russia's war against Ukraine. The United States and 
Romania have a strong partnership on energy, and I understand that 
Romania is working hard to reduce its reliance on Russian oil and 
natural gas in ways that meet our shared climate objectives.
    In partnership with the United States, Romania plans to double its 
nuclear energy capacity in the coming decade by building two additional 
reactors at the Cernavoda nuclear power plant by 2031 and by hosting a 
``first-of-its-kind'' small modular reactor (SMR) by 2028 or 2029. This 
expansion of Romania's nuclear power program will bolster Romania's 
energy security and reduce its reliance on Russian oil and natural gas 
in ways that meet our shared climate objectives. Once these projects 
are completed, Romania will be able to export more electricity to 
Moldova and Ukraine. The United States is also assisting Romanian 
policy makers and regulators in developing the administrative capacity 
for offshore wind, hydrogen, and geothermal energy.
    If confirmed, I commit to continuing to support U.S.-Romania energy 
cooperation to advance our energy security goals.

    Question. How can the U.S. and Romania work together to reduce 
dependence on Russian for energy supplies in the region?

    Answer. Romania's significant and diverse domestic energy resources 
provide it greater energy security than many of its neighbors. Romania 
supports energy diversification efforts and is uniquely positioned to 
bolster European energy security with its potential to increase energy 
supply from the Black Sea. The United States and Romania are working 
together to develop alternate sources of energy including through civil 
nuclear cooperation and building Romania's capacity for offshore wind, 
hydrogen, and geothermal energy.
    Romania also plays a critical role in helping neighbors like 
Moldova reduce dependence on Russian energy sources. Natural gas 
carrier Transgaz built reverse flow capacity with Bulgaria and Hungary, 
and a pipeline from the Romanian border to Chisinau, providing a 
potential alternative gas route for Moldova. If confirmed, I will 
continue these efforts to foster greater U.S.-Romanian energy 
cooperation.

    Question. How will you work with your State Department and 
interagency colleagues to coordinate U.S. economic engagement with 
Romania across the Balkans and greater Eastern European region?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with my colleagues at Mission 
Bucharest, in Washington, and in the region to build on the already 
strong economic relationship between the United States and Romania. One 
vehicle for expanded regional economic cooperation is offered by the 
Three Seas Initiative (3SI), which aims to strengthen North-South 
infrastructure on the EU's eastern flank in energy, transportation, and 
telecommunications. The Initiative now includes 12 countries across the 
Balkans and greater Eastern Europe region. Romania is an active 
participant and will host next year's summit.
    The U.S. Government strongly supports the 3SI, as it fosters 
regional prosperity and security, making its members stronger partners 
of the United States and more effective partners in building a Europe 
strong and free. If confirmed, I will support 3SI efforts as well as 
other regional efforts to build interconnectivity and economic 
cooperation.

    Question. Many U.S. Missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Bucharest?

    Answer. My understanding from the State Department is that, despite 
the challenges posed by COVID and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, morale 
is high, and the Mission is well-run. I am aware that following 
Russia's full-scale February invasion of neighboring Ukraine, the 
Mission has been called upon to do much more and has risen to the 
challenge. If confirmed, I will make it my priority to nurture and 
maintain high morale through open communication, frequent consultation, 
and listening to all employees as valued members of the team.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Bucharest?

    Answer. In my experience, building and sustaining high morale among 
team members is critical to the effectiveness of the Mission. If 
confirmed, upon arrival I intend to meet with all parts of the Mission 
community to offer support and encouragement, to understand their 
challenges and concerns, to establish regular channels of 
communication, and to identify key issues that need to be addressed. 
One area which I understand requires early attention is that of the 
level of compensation for Locally Employed staff. If confirmed, I will 
work with Washington colleagues to ensure that Locally Employed staff 
salaries keep up with those of the local labor market. I will strive to 
ensure that the Mission has the personnel and tools necessary to 
effectively carry out its expanded responsibilities.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Bucharest?

    Answer. If confirmed, I intend to lead an inclusive strategic 
planning exercise involving all Mission elements and drawing on 
previous planning exercises to ensure that the Mission team has a clear 
and unified vision of our goals and priorities. I will also ensure that 
there is a process for periodically assessing progress and making 
adjustments as needed. I will work with the Embassy management team, 
senior staff, and Community Liaison Office to promote open, 
constructive communication and an inclusive, welcoming culture in which 
creativity and initiative is encouraged and recognized. I will promote 
and attend community events, including Town Halls, informal get-
togethers, holiday celebrations, awards ceremonies and other happenings 
that contribute to a sense of teamwork and community.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. As a manager, I seek to build a team environment in which 
employees feel empowered to speak up, offer creative ideas, take 
initiative, do work that matters, and be recognized for their 
contributions. I am a strong advocate for the principles of diversity, 
equity, inclusion, and accessibility, and believe it is important that 
every leader and manager in the Mission model these values. As we work 
for the American people, we have the responsibility to hold ourselves 
to the highest ethical standards. If confirmed, I pledge to create a 
positive and productive work environment so we can successfully execute 
our mission.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. Absolutely not. It is never acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or in private. Such behavior 
undermines morale, reduces productivity, and is never acceptable from 
any manager. If confirmed, I pledge to treat all staff at Mission 
Bucharest with the utmost respect.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. Having served myself as a Deputy Chief of Mission, I 
understand the importance of establishing a strong, open, and honest 
partnership between the Ambassador and Deputy Chief of Mission, as this 
relationship is critical to the success of the Mission. As Ambassador, 
if confirmed, my intent is to empower my Deputy Chief of Mission as a 
chief operating officer to oversee day-to-day Mission management, to 
serve as my alter ego, and to act on my behalf in my absence.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will entrust my Deputy Chief of Mission to 
serve as the U.S. Embassy's Chief Operating Officer and my closest 
advisor. I will count on my Deputy Chief of Mission to offer honest, 
sound advice and well-founded recommendations. The position of Deputy 
Chief of Mission traditionally ensures its smooth operations and steps 
in for the Ambassador when he or she is not available. If confirmed, I 
will work closely with my deputy to ensure his or her success.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. I agree that accurate, timely, and constructive feedback is 
critical to foster morale and encourage high performance, as well as to 
encourage improvement. In my previous assignments as a manager, I 
always sought to offer constructive feedback, address deficiencies, and 
write effective evaluations that accurately reflect the employee's 
performance and contributions. If confirmed, I will continue to 
prioritize this management imperative.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed I will support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees, as I have done in my 
previous assignments as a manager and a leader.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Romania.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our Embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their Missions?

    Answer. As a leader and a diplomat, I believe that we must engage 
with as many local actors and organizations as possible to advance U.S. 
foreign policy and national security objectives. It is my understanding 
that our Embassy regularly engages with contacts outside the Mission. 
In my previous tour in Romania, I traveled widely throughout the 
country to promote our public diplomacy and advance people-to-people 
ties. If confirmed, I intend to interact with a wide array of Romanians 
around the country and will encourage my team to follow by example.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will encourage all employees at Embassy 
Bucharest to get outside the Mission walls, meet with local 
populations, and travel widely throughout the country to learn as much 
as possible about local issues. We will balance all security 
considerations appropriately. My understanding is that the team in 
Bucharest regularly travels throughout the country, and I intend to 
continue support for these efforts.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in 
Romania?

    Answer. The Romanian people admire and respect the United States 
and its people and desire closer ties at all levels. The Romanian 
people share our democratic principles and values, including respect 
for media freedom. As cultural affairs officer in Romania between 2005-
2008, I helped create the vibrant network of ten American Corners 
throughout Romania that regularly hold programs to educate Romanians 
about American culture and values.
    If confirmed, my public diplomacy objectives will mirror my Mission 
objectives, namely to leverage public diplomacy tools to enhance 
security cooperation, support a free, independent, and diverse press, 
counter malign influence, expand free market opportunities between the 
United States and Romania, strengthen democratic institutions, and 
deepen people-to-people ties. I will work to counter malign influence, 
in all its forms, with the variety of tools at our disposal, including 
with traditional media, social media, outreach, educational and 
capacity building grants and programs, and personal interactions.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. Disinformation poses problems throughout the world, and 
Romania is no exception. Russia has a long history of disseminating 
disinformation to Romania, and currently uses social media, messaging 
applications, and other avenues to this end. The messaging is 
frequently focused on the drawbacks of Romania aligning itself with the 
West.
    The amount of disinformation Russia disseminates to Romania has 
grown since Russia's further invasion of Ukraine this year, and the 
Kremlin's false narratives often accuse Ukraine of poor treatment of 
its Romanian minority. Disinformation about vaccines during the COVID 
crisis unfortunately discouraged many Romanians from getting 
vaccinated. If confirmed, I will engage with the Romanian Government, 
civil society, media outlets, and thought leaders ranging from 
politicians to journalists to ensure a unified and proactive approach 
to countering Russia's disinformation.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country Mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the Public Diplomacy Section 
to closely coordinate the efforts of public diplomacy professionals in 
both Washington and Bucharest to ensure that there is a unified 
approach to highlighting key U.S. messages and policies in Romania. The 
Public Diplomacy Section engages on a variety of different social media 
platforms in both English and Romanian to deliver tailored messages on 
U.S. foreign policy priorities; promote Embassy activities and events; 
provide information on security, voting, and other topics of interest 
to U.S. citizens; and communicate with the Romanian public.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to have no higher priority than the 
safety and security of the Embassy team and their family members. 
President Biden has said that the well-being of American public 
servants is of paramount importance to the Administration, and I share 
his view. If confirmed, I pledge to make every effort to protect and 
care for our personnel serving at the Mission.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Bucharest personnel?

    Answer. Throughout my career, including my past assignments as Head 
of Mission and Deputy Chief of Mission, I have placed a high value on 
open communication with those I manage. Effective communication enables 
us to operate as one Mission, and I understand that as a leader I set 
the tone. If confirmed, I commit to open communication with Mission 
Bucharest personnel.

    Question. In the 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report, Romania was 
upgraded to Tier 2 for various efforts to combat and monitor 
trafficking in persons. How will you work with the host government and 
civil society actors to address these issues if you are confirmed as 
Ambassador?

    Answer. Romania was upgraded to Tier 2 in the 2022 TIP Report, as 
the Government demonstrated improvement in anti-trafficking efforts, 
including by investigating more trafficking cases, prosecuting and 
convicting more traffickers, and increasing prevention efforts. 
However, trafficking remains a significant problem in Romania. Romania 
is one of the primary source countries of human trafficking in the EU.
    I understand that the U.S. Government works closely with Romania on 
law enforcement, judicial training, education, and victim assistance 
programs. If confirmed, I will engage frequently with civil society 
actors working on trafficking issues and encourage Romanian authorities 
to prioritize combating trafficking in persons, intensify victim 
identification efforts, collaborate with NGOs, and support trafficking 
victims through a victim-centered approach.

    Question. Do you commit to reporting accurate information as it 
pertains to the reality of the trafficking situation in Romania?

    Answer. The Department of State's Trafficking in Persons report is 
an important diplomatic tool for engaging with foreign governments on 
efforts to end human trafficking. As Secretary Blinken said on his 
message for the 2022 TIP report, human trafficking affects all 
countries ``by diminishing and destroying our communities, sense of 
security, and the global economy.'' If confirmed, I pledge that Mission 
Bucharest will report accurate information as it pertains to the 
trafficking situation in Romania.

    Question. What efforts, if any, does the Government of Romania 
provide to local NGOs to support trafficking victims and to prevent 
further trafficking?

    Answer. I understand from the 2022 TIP Report that the Government 
of Romania implemented a pilot program that authorized funding at the 
local level to an NGO for victim services. Additionally, the Government 
adopted an emergency ordinance and an action plan aimed at improving 
its capacity to assist vulnerable children and other at-risk 
populations and investigate various crimes against children, including 
trafficking. These efforts contributed to Romania's upgrade to Tier 2. 
If confirmed, I pledge to continue the Mission's support for Romania's 
efforts to support trafficking victims, hold traffickers accountable, 
and prevent future trafficking.

    Question. In the 2021 International Religious Freedom report, 
Romania was identified as generally intolerant of religious freedom, 
particularly regarding the treatment of Jewish individuals and 
institutions. What is your assessment of this particular issue and if 
confirmed, how will you work with the office of the Ambassador-at-Large 
for International Religious Freedom to bolster religious freedom in-
country?

    Answer. As noted in the State Department International Religious 
Freedom report, there have been isolated cases of government 
discrimination against minority religious groups in Romania. As in many 
countries in the region, antisemitism in Romania tends to manifest as 
hate speech (including online hate speech), vandalism, and Holocaust 
distortion or conspiracy theories. In May 2021, the Government approved 
a two-year national strategy and action plan to combat antisemitism, 
xenophobia, radicalization, and hate speech. On November 15, 2021, the 
Romanian Senate passed a bill making Holocaust education compulsory for 
all high school students by 2023, marking an important step forward for 
Holocaust remembrance and education in Romania.
    If confirmed, I will advocate for religious freedom and equality of 
treatment for all religious groups, and work with the Ambassador-at-
Large for International Religious Freedom, the Special Envoy to Monitor 
and Combat antisemitism, and our Romanian Government and NGO partners 
to counter antisemitism, anti-Muslim hatred, and other forms of 
discrimination against minority religious groups.

    Question. In the 2021 Human Rights Report, Romania was identified 
has having significant human rights abuses, including widespread 
corruption and cruel and inhuman punishment of individuals by the 
Government. If confirmed, what steps will you take to address these 
instances with the host government?

    Answer. Advancing human rights is a cornerstone of U.S. foreign 
policy and if confirmed I pledge to work closely with the Government of 
Romania and with civil society to advocate for human rights 
protections.

    Question. How will you direct your Embassy to work with civil 
society organizations to improve the human rights situation on the 
ground?

    Answer. Civil society plays in important role in advocating for 
human rights and reporting human rights violations. I understand our 
Embassy already has strong relationships with various civil society 
organizations in Romania. As part of my efforts to ensure Embassy staff 
are getting out and talking to all members of the local society, if 
confirmed, I will encourage my team to proactively meet with civil 
society organizations in Romania.

    Question. Romania's access to the Visa Waiver Program is very 
important to Romanian citizens and Americans of Romanian origin. 
Romania is a key and steadfast U.S. ally and one of only two EU member 
nations whose citizens cannot travel to the U.S. without a visa. How do 
you plan to work to change this situation?

    Answer. I am aware of Romania's desire to join the U.S. Visa Waiver 
Program (VWP) and look forward to Romania joining the program when it 
meets the eligibility criteria. If confirmed, I pledge to work with the 
Department of Homeland Security, which administers the VWP in 
consultation with the State Department, and with the Government of 
Romania, as it works to meet the various law enforcement, immigration, 
and security requirements for designation into the program. Romania 
does not currently meet the Congressionally mandated visitor visa 
refusal rate of less than three percent, although this is only one of 
many criteria required for designation into the program. Romania's 
refusal rate has remained steady around 10 percent over the past 
decade.

    Question. What role could Romania's oil and natural gas resources 
play in bolstering energy security in central and eastern Europe? What 
types of projects or support would enable their development and 
transportation?

    Answer. Romania's significant domestic energy resources provide it 
greater energy security than many of its neighbors. Romania produced 
8.7 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas and 3.5 million tons of 
oil in 2020, ranking fourth for gas production and fifth for oil 
production in Europe. With at least 200 bcm of proven natural gas 
reserves and 600 million barrels of proven oil reserves, Romania has 
potential to bolster European energy security by providing Romania and 
other European countries an alternative to Russian oil and gas.
    Romania also plays a critical role in helping neighbors like 
Moldova reduce dependence on Russian energy sources. Natural gas 
carrier Transgaz built reverse flow capacity with Bulgaria and Hungary, 
and a pipeline from the Romanian border to Chisinau, providing a 
potential future alternative gas route for Moldova.
    The United States and Romania have a strong partnership on energy 
security and diversification. Business plays an important role in 
bringing prosperity to both our nations. Romania has made strides in 
improving its investment climate in recent years, although challenges 
remain. The United States Government is currently working with U.S. 
companies eager to enter Romania's oil and gas market with a view to 
investing for the long-term. If confirmed, I pledge to continue 
assisting U.S. companies interested in investing in Romania and to 
advocate for policies that facilitate foreign investment, including in 
the oil and natural gas sector.

    Question. Please discuss U.S.-Romania cooperation on nuclear 
energy. To what extent could nuclear energy bolster Romania's energy 
security?

    Answer. In partnership with the United States, Romania plans to 
double its nuclear energy capacity in the coming decade by building two 
additional reactors at the Cernavoda nuclear power plant by 2031 and 
hosting a ``first-of-its-kind'' small modular reactor (SMR) by 2028 or 
2029. This expansion of Romania's nuclear power program will bolster 
Romania's energy security and reduce its reliance on Russian oil and 
natural gas in ways that meet our shared climate and energy security 
objectives. Once these projects are completed, Romania will be able to 
export more electricity to Moldova and Ukraine. Romania is working with 
U.S. SMR designer NuScale on building the SMR, which represents 
preeminent U.S. nuclear power technology with a remarkable level of 
safety, creates thousands of jobs, strengthens Romanian and European 
energy security, and addresses the climate crisis head on.
    At COP27, the United States reaffirmed our support for projects to 
refurbish the Cernavoda nuclear power plant's Unit 1 and complete 
construction of Unit 3 and Unit 4 by delivering letters of interest for 
more than $3 billion in financing from EXIM. I pledge to continue this 
important cooperation as Ambassador, if confirmed.

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. As we speak, the Party is 
cracking down on unprecedented student protests across the country. 
With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry, the CCP 
could stop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. The President made it clear in his National Security 
Strategy that the People's Republic of China (PRC) harbors the 
intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international 
order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its 
benefit. The PRC is a strategic competitor, and Secretary Blinken has 
committed to align our efforts with partners and allies and compete 
with the PRC to defend our interests and build our vision for the 
future.
    Romania shares our clear-eyed assessment of the PRC and has pushed 
back on PRC influence with respect to 5G and nuclear energy issues, and 
banned countries, like the PRC, that did not comply with EU rules from 
competing in state-owned procurement tenders. Romania has participated 
in the PRC's China-CEEC (Central and Eastern European Countries) or 
``14 +1'' platform leadership events by sending representatives at the 
ministerial or lower levels.
    If confirmed, I will seek opportunities to strengthen our 
cooperation with Romania to uphold shared values.

    Question. Does the CCP undertake any activities that are beneficial 
to U.S. interests?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors, as the President 
laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United States does not 
seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our allies and partners have an 
opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in a way that 
influences their behavior even as we compete with them. The United 
States' approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC 
where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them when 
they align. If confirmed, I will continue working closely with Romania 
to strengthen our shared values of democracy and support for the rules-
based order.

    Question. Do you believe there are any areas within which the CCP 
would constructively work with the United States in good faith?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors, as the President 
laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United States does not 
seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our allies and partners have an 
opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in a way that 
influences their behavior even as we compete with them. The United 
States' approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC 
where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them when 
they align. If confirmed, I will continue working closely with Romania 
to strengthen our shared values of democracy and support for the rules-
based order.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China in 
Romania?

    Answer. As the United States National Security Strategy makes clear 
and as Secretary Blinken said in October, the People's Republic of 
China (PRC) is the greatest geopolitical challenge that we face because 
it is the only competitor with the intent and increasingly the 
capability to remake the international order. And Beijing's actions 
suggest PRC officials have the intention to do so. Romania shares our 
skepticism of the PRC and has downgraded its cooperation and actively 
pushed back against PRC influence. The United States' approach towards 
the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC where our interests and 
values differ and cooperating with them when they align. If confirmed, 
I will support the Administration's policy on the PRC.

    Question. Last month, we saw what was widely suspected to be 
Russian missile attack on Polish territory. Had this been true, we 
would have been in a situation where a NATO ally would invoke Article 5 
and we would need to respond and uphold our treaty commitments to 
defend NATO territory. Thankfully, the Polish Government kept its cool, 
waited for all information to come in, and determined that it was 
shrapnel from a Ukrainian air defense missile. It is a tragedy, 
nonetheless, for the two Polish victims and their families, but not a 
cause for potential nuclear war. Romania, like Poland, is a NATO ally 
that has an extensive border with Ukraine.

   If confirmed, how would you handle a situation where there is 
        reasonable suspicion that Russia has attacked Romania?

    Answer. Secretary Blinken has reiterated that the United States has 
full confidence in the Polish Government's investigation of the 
explosion near their border with Ukraine and commended them for the 
professional and deliberate manner in which they are conducting it. It 
is clear that the party ultimately responsible for this tragic incident 
is Russia. Ukraine had--and has--every right to defend itself. Romania 
shares a land border with Ukraine and is a Black Sea littoral state, 
and it has been vocal about the need for a unified NATO stance against 
Russia's encroachment in the region. I understand there are currently 
nearly 5,000 NATO Allied troops in Romania. If confirmed, I will 
continue to work with Romania and other NATO Allies to develop our 
response to Russia's unprovoked and horrific war and, if necessary, 
uphold our Article 5 commitments.

    Question. What is your assessment of the Romanian Government's 
ability to respond in the same way Poland had last month?

    Answer. Romania is a steadfast NATO Ally and partner. We have a 
close and collaborative security relationship and Romania has been 
united with us and other NATO Allies on NATO's response to Russia's 
invasion of Ukraine. The explosion that led to the tragic deaths of two 
Polish citizens recently in Przedowow highlighted the importance of 
continued, close coordination among NATO Allies. If confirmed, I will 
continue to work with Romania and our other NATO Allies to encourage 
unity in our response to Russia's continued aggression.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to advise the Romanian 
Government to convey to the Russians the disastrous mistake they would 
make should they attempt an attack on NATO?

    Answer. Romania is an enthusiastic supporter of a strong and united 
NATO. Romanians view Russia as their greatest threat, a view that has 
been shaped by history and Russia's repeated incursions into 
historically Romanian territory. Romania understands that now is not a 
time for business as usual with Russia. If confirmed, I will work 
closely with the Romanian Government to ensure NATO Allies speak with 
one voice in condemning Russia's aggression.

    Question. Putin's war in Ukraine has wreaked a tremendous 
humanitarian cost on the people of Ukraine. Not least among these is 
the issue of orphans, many of whom were in the middle of the process to 
be adopted by American families. Several of my constituents across the 
State of Florida are worried about the safety of the children they have 
selflessly committed to welcoming into their families. I understand 
that the Ukrainian Government had relocated these orphans to facilities 
in Romanian. My office has received reports that these facilities are 
lacking compared to those in Ukraine and the United States.

   If confirmed, what will you do to ensure the wellbeing of these 
        orphans in Romanian while they wait until it is safe again to 
        resume intercountry adoptions?

    Answer. The United States fully recognizes and respects concerns 
and desires to care for these children in need. If confirmed, I would 
do everything in my power to work with the Romanian authorities to 
ensure the well-being of any Ukrainian children in Romanian care and 
destined for U.S. adoption. As the Government of Ukraine is the legal 
guardian of the refugee orphans, we must defer to Ukraine in its 
authority over decisions about the best interests of their citizens.
    We understand many families seek to bring children in the process 
of being adopted to the United States temporarily for their safety. The 
Department does not have the ability to facilitate the transfer of 
Ukrainian children to the United States or other countries outside of 
the adoption process in compliance with U.S. and Ukrainian laws that 
govern adoption and immigration.

    Question. Last year, Romania passed a law, similar to my Secure 
Equipment Act, that banned Huawei from entering the Romanian telecoms 
market. While this is a great first step more is needed to protect the 
integrity of Romania's telecommunications networks from companies 
controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.

   If confirmed, what will you do to encourage Romania to adopt 
        policies that also ban Tiktok, Hikvision, ZTE and other CCP-
        controlled companies?

    Answer. Romania has shown great leadership in pushing back on PRC 
influence with respect to 5G and nuclear energy issues, and on banning 
countries, like the PRC, that did not comply with EU rules on competing 
in state-owned procurement tenders. As you note, in 2021, Romania 
passed legislation that banned untrusted vendors from its 5G 
infrastructure. In October, the Romanian Government finalized 
regulations for a new investment screening committee, modeled off the 
process facilitated by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the 
United States (CFIUS) to block malign influence. If confirmed, I will 
actively seek opportunities to strengthen our cooperation with Romania 
to uphold shared values and promote rules-based economic cooperation.

    Question. How can the U.S. work with the Three Seas Initiative and 
other regional fora to provide alternative sources of investment and 
financing to improve telecommunications infrastructure in Romania and 
other European countries?

    Answer. I understand that Romania is an enthusiastic participant in 
the Three Seas Initiative (3SI), which aims to strengthen North-South 
infrastructure on the EU's eastern flank in energy, transportation, and 
telecommunications. Romania invested 20 million euros in the 3SI 
Investment Fund and will also host the next 3SI summit in 2023.
    The U.S. Government strongly supports the Three Seas Initiative; 
the U.S. Development Finance Corporation has agreed to provide up to 
$300 million in financing to the 3SI Investment Fund. The Three Seas 
Initiative fosters regional prosperity and security, making its members 
stronger partners of the United States and more effective partners in 
building a Europe strong and free. It also creates important 
opportunities for U.S. businesses. If confirmed, I will urge Three Seas 
member countries to focus on concrete outcomes that will position the 
Initiative as a platform for meaningful action.

the potential to bolster European energy security by providing Romania 
and other European countries an alternative to Russian oil and gas.
    In June 2022, a consortium led by U.S. company Carlyle--Black Sea 
Oil and Gas--went online, extracting natural gas from the Black Sea at 
a rate of approximately 1 bcm per year, helping to diversify the 
region's natural gas supply. State-owned natural gas producer Romgaz 
took over ExxonMobil's share in Neptun Deep, a deep-water offshore 
natural gas project, in 2022. If Romania develops this offshore bloc, 
it could become a net exporter of natural gas to the region.
    Romania also plays a critical role in helping neighbors like 
Moldova reduce dependence on Russian energy sources. Natural gas 
carrier Transgaz built reverse flow capacity with Bulgaria and Hungary, 
and a pipeline from the Romanian border to Chisinau, providing a 
potential future alternative gas route for Moldova.

assisting U.S. companies interested in investing in Romania and to 
advocate for policies that facilitate foreign investment, including in 
the oil and natural gas sector.

    Question. There is a growing concern about the vulnerability of 
refugees to human trafficking in Romania and elsewhere in the region. 
Will you prioritize this issue in your engagement with the Romanian 
Government and civil society organizations?

    Answer. Secretary Blinken noted at the launch of the Department of 
State's 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report that Russia's war against 
Ukraine has forced millions of Ukrainians to flee their homes, making 
them highly vulnerable to exploitation. Romania has welcomed more than 
two and a half million refugees from Ukraine, 85,000 of which remain in 
the country. Romania has created a significant humanitarian assistance 
apparatus to facilitate the entry, processing, and transit for this 
large number of refugees, and through the State Department's Bureau of 
Population, Refugees, and Migration, the United States has provided 
more than $40 million to international humanitarian organizations in 
Romania supporting refugees from Ukraine.
    The United States supports Romania's efforts to support trafficking 
victims, hold traffickers accountable, and prevent future trafficking. 
If confirmed as Ambassador, I will prioritize this important issue in 
my engagements with the Romanian Government and civil society 
organizations and continue our efforts to combat trafficking.

           Submitted to Bijan Sabet by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission 
Prague?

    Answer. My understanding is that morale at U.S. Embassy Prague is 
good, though challenges with retention of local staff due to salaries 
not keeping up with the local labor market have put a strain on many 
sections. With Russia's war against Ukraine impacting the Czech 
Republic and other nearby EU member states, the Czech Republic holding 
the Council of the EU presidency since July 2022, and numerous high-
level visits to Prague, I understand the Mission's workload has grown, 
and the team has stepped up to meet the challenge. If confirmed, I will 
prioritize morale throughout the Mission, advocate for increases to 
Locally Employed Staff salaries that keep up with the labor market and 
focus on strategies for improving retention.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Prague?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will bring my experience, energy, 
creativity, and leadership to Embassy Prague. One of my first actions 
will be to meet the entire Embassy team, and I will mentor employees to 
prioritize objectives, seek creative ways to address challenges, and 
focus on efficiency. I will lead by example and hold myself to the same 
standard expected of the entire team. I understand that great ideas can 
come from all parts of an organization and all levels, and I will 
listen to the Embassy team. I will demonstrate my openness to 
respectful differences of opinion and will encourage the highest level 
of professionalism. If confirmed, I will work closely with the senior 
staff, Management team, and Community Liaison Officer (CLO) to promote 
a collegial atmosphere and I will maintain open, transparent 
communication. I pledge to hold regular Town Hall meetings, consult 
with all staff (both U.S. Direct Hires and Locally Employed Staff), and 
convey my appreciation for the work they do to advance U.S. foreign 
policy goals. I will advocate for Locally Employed staff salaries that 
keep up with the labor market and focus on strategies for improving 
retention. I will also support employees by prioritizing wellness and 
mental health.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Prague?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will ensure all team members at all levels 
of the Embassy understand the strategic priorities of the 
Administration, the Mission, and the Department. I commit to ensure all 
in the Embassy understand their role in advancing these priorities and 
receive sufficient support in carrying out those responsibilities. My 
management style is active and engaged, and I will make sure that 
everyone at U.S. Embassy Prague knows that my open-door policy is 
genuine and that I am readily available. I will always prioritize a 
``one team'' culture. If confirmed, I will continuously engage with the 
entire Embassy Team to articulate objectives, measure performance, 
provide constructive feedback, and deliver operational excellence.

    Question. How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I have developed a management approach throughout my career 
that embraces three key elements: active listening, leading by example, 
and an ongoing commitment to foster a deep team alignment around a 
well-understood mission and purpose. I have also learned that the best 
ideas can often come from all areas of an organization and commit to 
creating a team-oriented environment. I am also a strong proponent of 
open communication and ensuring that people are recognized for the 
important work they do. This includes ensuring that members of the team 
have opportunities to grow and further develop skills in order to 
advance their careers.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No. Berating subordinates undermines morale, reduces 
productivity, and is never acceptable from any leader. If confirmed, I 
will treat employees with the utmost respect and expect all within the 
Embassy to do the same. I will not waiver from maintaining this 
standard of workplace conduct.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I expect to build a positive working 
relationship based on trust and mutual respect with the Deputy Chief of 
Mission. I will empower her to serve as the Mission's chief operating 
officer, delegate when appropriate, and ensure she successfully leads 
the Mission when I am not available. At the same time, I will remain 
personally accountable for the Mission's success.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work closely with the Deputy Chief of 
Mission to ensure the effective management of U.S. Embassy Prague and 
to advance U.S. priorities in the Czech Republic, including: protecting 
the safety and security of U.S. citizens, deepening our economic ties, 
and advancing our shared political priorities. Coming from the private 
sector, I will rely on her expertise for many matters related to the 
inner workings of an effective U.S. Embassy, and will consult closely 
with her on all bilateral issues.

    Question. Do you believe that it is important to provide employees 
with accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order to 
encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their 
roles?

    Answer. Yes, I absolutely believe this. Candid and comprehensive 
performance reviews are essential for employees to know where they 
stand and for them to understand where they need to improve. If 
confirmed, I commit to proactively learning about the Department's 
Employee Evaluation Report (EER) process. It is also important for 
supervisors to make clear what the expectations are and to give 
continuous constructive feedback. If confirmed, I will place a high 
priority on proactively providing accurate, constructive feedback to 
senior staff and ensure they do the same for their teams.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. I fully support these principles and, if confirmed, I 
pledge to provide my employees clear, accurate, and direct feedback. If 
confirmed, I will ensure employees receive a clear assessment of their 
performance, including specific acknowledgment of achievement and 
concrete areas for improvement. This kind of communication and feedback 
is fundamental to a high functioning and healthy work environment.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Greece.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our Embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. Creating people-to-people ties is one of the best ways not 
only to conduct business but to build relationships between our nations 
and advance U.S. interests. In an environment where disinformation is 
prevalent, it is especially essential to receive first-hand information 
from government counterparts and the citizens of the Czech Republic. If 
confirmed, I pledge to meet with communities throughout the Czech 
Republic, and I will ensure the Embassy team follows my example of 
proactive outreach.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will make clear that outreach to diverse 
populations and regions is a core component of the Embassy's 
responsibilities. I will encourage Embassy staff to engage with the 
broadest cross-section of communities across the Czech Republic and 
will ensure that U.S. diplomats under my authority can do so safely.

    Question. What is the public diplomacy environment like in Czech 
Republic?

    Answer. The majority of Czech citizens see the U.S.-Czech 
relationship as strong. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 
Czech public opinion has become more strongly pro-Western; one non-
governmental organization's survey reported 87 percent of Czechs 
support remaining in NATO, a significant increase from last year.
    Czech media is free and independent; however, business and politics 
often intersect, resulting in several large media conglomerates. If 
confirmed, I will continue the Mission's goals of supporting free 
media, including supporting the Czech Republic in its Summit for 
Democracy pledge to strengthen the independence of Czech public media 
through sustainable financing and protection from political influence 
while supporting independent journalists.
    If confirmed, I pledge to meet regularly with a wide range of 
Czechs--in person, on social media, via the traditional press--to 
improve their views of the United States and the importance of the 
Transatlantic relationship.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. A significant challenge in the Czech Republic is 
disinformation. Russia has a long history of disseminating 
disinformation to the Czech Republic and the wider region, using social 
media, messaging applications, and other avenues. This disinformation 
is frequently focused on the drawbacks of the Czech Republic aligning 
itself with the West. If confirmed, I would continue to engage with the 
Czech Government, civil society, and the broader public to ensure a 
unified and proactive approach to counter Russian disinformation.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the Public Diplomacy Section 
to closely coordinate the efforts of public diplomacy professionals in 
both Washington and the Czech Republic to ensure there is a unified 
approach to highlighting key U.S. messages and policies in the Czech 
Republic. The Public Diplomacy Section engages on a variety of 
different social media platforms in both English and Czech to deliver 
tailored messages on U.S. foreign policy priorities; promote Embassy 
activities and events; provide information on security, voting, and 
other topics of interest to U.S. citizens; and communicate with the 
Czech public.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. I understand these incidents are an absolute priority for 
the Department, and they would be an absolute priority for me if I am 
confirmed. I have no higher priority than the safety of the members of 
Embassy Prague and their family members.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Prague personnel?

    Answer. Yes. I believe open and transparent communication is 
critical for a healthy and efficient workplace, and leadership should 
set the example for that. This is particularly true in the context of 
anomalous health incidents.

    Question. In the 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report, the Czech 
Republic was identified as Tier 1 for sustained efforts to combat human 
trafficking, but did fall short in accurately identifying trafficking 
victims. How will you work with the host government and civil society 
actors to address these issues if you are confirmed as Ambassador?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will ensure Czech interlocutors understand 
the United States is committed to combating trafficking in persons in 
the Czech Republic and beyond. While the Czech Government has 
demonstrated serious and sustained effort to combat human trafficking, 
there are still concerns with inadequate collection of trafficking data 
and ineffective screening of vulnerable populations, such as asylum-
seekers and migrant workers. New trafficking risks have emerged since 
February 2022 with the arrival of refugees from Ukraine, most of whom 
are women and children. If confirmed, I will encourage the Czech 
Government to increase proactive identification and assistance for 
victims. If confirmed, I will lead Mission Prague to develop and 
implement both short- and long-term strategies of engagement with 
government officials, business leaders, and civil society in the Czech 
Republic.

    Question. Do you commit to reporting accurate information as it 
pertains to the reality of the trafficking situation in the Czech 
Republic?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue to pursue opportunities for 
the United States to share its expertise to strengthen the Czech 
Republic's capacity to address human trafficking. If confirmed, I 
commit to reporting accurate information as it pertains to the reality 
of the trafficking situation in the Czech Republic.

    Question. In the 2021 International Religious Freedom report, the 
Czech Republic was identified as lacking societal respect for religious 
freedom with noted violent incidents against ethnic and religious 
minorities. What is your assessment of this particular issue and if 
confirmed, how will you work with office of the Ambassador-at-Large for 
international religious freedom to bolster religious freedom in-
country?

    Answer. The Czech constitution provides for the protection of the 
freedom of religion or belief, and there are not major religious 
freedom issues. Societal anti-Muslim sentiment and antisemitism are not 
uncommon, however. If confirmed, I will commit to working with the 
Czech Government, faith leaders, civil society, and internally with the 
Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom and Special 
Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism to proactively address these 
issues.

    Question. In the 2021 Human Rights Report, the Czech Republic was 
identified as having significant human rights abuses, including 
violence against women and threats of violence against minorities, 
including the Romani.
    If confirmed, what steps will you take to address these instances 
with the host government?

    Answer. Human rights issues of concern in the Czech Republic 
include crimes and threats of violence against members of the Roma 
community, lack of accountability for violence against women due to 
limitations within the Czech legal framework, and legal disparities 
that remain for same-sex couples. Continuing the legacy of former 
president Vaclav Havel, the Czech Government has prioritized human 
rights and strives to serve as a worldwide leader. In May, the Czech 
Republic was elected to take Russia's vacated U.N. Human Rights Council 
(UNHRC) seat. Since Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion of 
Ukraine, the Czech Republic has also provided resettlement assistance 
to hundreds of Russian and Belarusian civil society activists and 
journalists to continue their work in Prague. U.S. Embassy Prague 
actively supports human rights through advocacy, awareness raising, and 
direct support to non-governmental organizations. If confirmed, I will 
continue to prioritize respect for human rights as a shared value of 
the bilateral relationship.

    Question. How will you direct your Embassy to work with civil 
society organizations to improve the human rights situation on the 
ground?

    Answer. U.S. Embassy Prague actively supports human rights through 
advocacy, awareness-raising, and direct support to non-governmental 
organizations. If confirmed, I will work with Embassy Prague and the 
Czech Government to proactively address the continued marginalization 
of the Czech Republic's Roma minority.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
            Submitted to Bijan Sabet by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. As we speak, the Party is 
cracking down on unprecedented student protests across the country. 
With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry, the CCP 
could stop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. The President made it clear in the National Security 
Strategy that the People's Republic of China (PRC) harbors the 
intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international 
order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its 
benefit. As Secretary Blinken has stated, we will invest at home, align 
our efforts with partners and allies, and compete with the PRC to 
defend our interests and build our vision for the future. Alongside the 
United States, the Czech Republic has been clear-eyed on the threat the 
PRC poses. If confirmed, I would work to deepen ties between Washington 
and Prague and leverage the inherent advantages of our democracies to 
ensure the international system remains rooted in democratic values, 
not authoritarian ones.

    Question. Does the CCP undertake any activities that are beneficial 
to U.S. interests?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors, as the President 
laid out in the National Security Strategy, the United States does not 
seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our allies and partners have an 
opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in a way that 
influences its behavior even as we compete with it. The United States' 
approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC where our 
interests and values differ and cooperating with them when they align. 
If confirmed, I will continue working closely with the Czech Republic 
to strengthen our shared values of democracy and support for the rules-
based international order.

    Question. Do you believe there are any areas within which the CCP 
would constructively work with the United States in good faith?

    Answer. Competition is the defining feature of our relationship 
with the PRC. The United States is open to cooperation with Beijing 
when interests intersect, and where the world expects the United States 
to do so as a responsible global power. Potential areas of cooperation 
include climate change, global health security, counterproliferation, 
and counternarcotics.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China in 
Czechia?

    Answer. As the United States National Security Strategy makes 
clear, and as Secretary Blinken stated, the People's Republic of China 
(PRC) is the greatest geopolitical challenge that we face because it is 
the only competitor with the intent, and increasingly the capability, 
to remake the international order. Beijing's actions suggest PRC 
officials have the intention to do so. The Czech Republic shares our 
skepticism of the PRC and has downgraded its cooperation and actively 
pushed back against PRC influence, including by enacting a foreign 
investment screening law. The United States' approach towards the PRC 
focuses on competing where our interests and values differ and 
cooperating with it when they align. If confirmed, I will support the 
Administration's policy on the PRC.

    Question. In recent weeks, Czechia has seen a growing number of 
conflicting protests regarding assistance to Ukraine. Several tens of 
thousands of people have gathered in Prague for both anti-Ukraine 
protests, as well as pro-Ukraine protests. While the Czech Government 
remains broadly supportive of continuing assistance to Ukraine, these 
protests reflect a growing division in Czech society. It is paramount 
that Europe maintains the will to provide assistance to Ukraine so that 
the United States and its Pacific allies have the bandwidth to lead the 
charge in confronting the CCP in the Indo-Pacific.

   If confirmed, what can you do to bolster bipartisan support for 
        Ukraine assistance within Czech society?

    Answer. The Czech Republic has been one of the clearest voices 
supporting Ukraine's sovereignty and has contributed over $180 million. 
In addition, a Czech public crowdfunding campaign collected over $55 
million to purchase military equipment for Ukraine from the Czech 
defense industry. The Czech Government has sent more than $15 million 
in humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and public Czech donors have collected 
over $120 million for humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. Czechs have 
opened their homes to over 460,000 refugees from Ukraine. Several 
rallies have been held in Prague with tens of thousands of Czechs 
demonstrating solidarity with Ukraine and support for democratic 
values.
    I have also read about the recent protests in Prague and recognize 
the concerns of many Czech citizens related to high energy prices and 
inflation. If confirmed, I commit to working with the Czech Government 
to find solutions to the energy crisis, including working with U.S. 
companies, and to continue to build and maintain support for Ukraine 
across the Czech political spectrum.

    Question. In January, Czechia will hold general elections for its 
Presidency and parliament. Based on the local election results in 
September, it's likely we'll see a return to power for former Prime 
Minister Andrej Babis' ANO party. What implications would a new Babis 
Government have on continued Czech support for Ukraine?

    Answer. While I cannot predict the outcome of the Czech 
presidential election in January, if confirmed, I commit to working 
closely with the next Czech president to maintain the long history of 
shared commitment to democracy, freedom, and to the strong bilateral 
relationship between the Czech Republic and the United States. 
Government leaders across all major parties in the Czech Republic have 
voiced their unwavering public support for Ukraine, and if confirmed, I 
pledge to work closely with all Czech leaders to support the Czech 
Republic as it stands with Ukraine.

    Question. Since February, the CCP has worked feverishly to create 
the facade that it's somehow not complicit in Putin's invasion of 
Ukraine. They do this by issuing statements emphasizing their support 
for a peaceful resolution and respect for sovereignty. In reality, the 
CCP continues to purchase Russian energy and do business with 
sanctioned Russian companies. Earlier this year, Latvia and Estonia 
both withdrew from the ``Cooperation between China and Central and 
Eastern European Countries Initiative,'' also known as the ``16+1,'' 
which the CCP uses to promote its views within Europe. In August, I 
sent a letter to the President, urging the Administration to support 
countries that leave the 16+1 and face a CCP economic blockade as a 
result.

   In June, the Czech Government announced its intention to explore 
        withdrawing from 16+1. What can you tell me about the status of 
        the Government's decision to leave this CCP-led international 
        organization?

    Answer. The Czech Republic engages with China diplomatically and 
commercially. It is also presently part of the 14+1 framework. Earlier 
this year, the Czech Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defense, and 
Security unanimously passed a non-binding resolution calling on the 
Government to leave the PRC's 14+1 initiative, and my understanding is 
that the issue is still under consideration. The Czech Republic has not 
been a recipient of major PRC investment, and recent opinion polls show 
that Czech attitudes toward the PRC are turning less favorable. Czech 
civil society organizations--as well as some officials--are enhancing 
cooperation with Taiwan while taking a harder line on the PRC. Under 
both the current and previous governments, the Czechs have been leaders 
in Europe for expanding international space for cooperation with 
Taiwan, particularly economic and academic engagement.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to working to persuade the 
Czech Government to finalize a decision to withdraw from 16+1?

    Answer. The United States supports countries' sovereign right to 
shape the contours of their foreign policy. That said, I understand the 
State Department has shared concerns with U.S. allies and partners over 
the PRC's problematic policies, including in Europe and we have seen 
increasing concern among the Czech authorities about the PRC's foreign 
policy. The Czech Republic will make its own decision on membership in 
the grouping, which is now known as the 14+1 following the departure of 
Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia over concerns with problematic PRC 
policies, including support for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine 
and economic coercion of Lithuania.

    Question. Nominees from the private sector often bring a fresh 
perspective to their positions. However, they also sometimes chafe 
against the sometimes onerous but necessary restrictions of 
bureaucracy. How would you work with members of your Mission who may 
tell you that certain things cannot be done?

    Answer. I have consulted with several highly effective U.S. 
Ambassadors who came from the private sector. If confirmed, I will 
bring my experience, energy, creativity, and leadership to the Mission. 
I will mentor our teams to prioritize objectives, seek creative ways to 
address challenges, and focus on operational excellence. If confirmed, 
I will promote a team atmosphere and will empower our team through 
open, transparent communication to execute our mandate and advance U.S. 
interests in the Czech Republic. I pledge to hold regular Town Hall 
meetings, consult with all staff (U.S. Direct Hires and Locally 
Employed staff), and convey my appreciation for the work they do to 
advance U.S. foreign policy goals. With Russia's war against Ukraine 
impacting nearby EU states, the Czech Republic holding the Council of 
the EU presidency since July 2022, and numerous high-level visits of 
late, I understand the Mission has stepped up to meet the challenge. If 
confirmed, I will advocate for Locally Employed staff salaries that 
keep up with the labor market and focus on strategies for improving 
retention.

    Question. Can you speak to any personal experience in how you 
handled dissent from employees within any of your past ventures?

    Answer. I have developed a management approach throughout my career 
that embraces three key elements: active listening, leading by example, 
and an ongoing commitment to foster a deep team alignment around a 
well-understood mission and purpose. I have also learned that the best 
ideas can often come from all areas of an organization. The State 
Department has a strong interest in facilitating open, creative, and 
honest dialogue on foreign policy issues, including the opportunity to 
offer alternative or dissenting opinions without fear of penalty. 
Whether through informal conversations with me or through more formal 
procedures with the Department of State's Dissent Channel, if 
confirmed, I commit to supporting all Mission employees in their 
ability to express dissenting or alternative views on policy issues.

    Question. There have been a number of coups in Africa since 2020--
two in Mali, two in Burkina Faso, one in Chad, one in Guinea, and one 
in Sudan. The African Union (AU) should serve as an important bulwark 
against unconstitutional change in Africa. Unfortunately, coups 
continue to occur.

   What actions is the AU taking--beyond the suspension of some 
        countries--to deter military coups in Africa, and what role 
        will you play if confirmed in advocating for consistent 
        consequences for those who undertake coups and other 
        unconstitutional changes of government by the AU?

    Answer. With limited exceptions, the AU has consistently applied 
their policy of suspending countries who suffer from a coup or other 
unconstitutional change of government. Following the AU Extraordinary 
Summit on Terrorism and Unconstitutional Changes in Government in 
Malabo in May 2022, the AU has rededicated efforts to improving 
implementation of AU sanctions and enhancing its coordination with the 
Regional Economic Communities and Regional Mechanisms (RECs/RMs). We 
support these efforts.

    Question. If confirmed, what will your role be in advocating for 
consistent application of the African Union's own principle of 
prohibiting transitional leaders from serving as candidates in 
elections they are responsible for organizing?

    Answer. I anticipate being as proactive as possible to reinforce 
this principle and to encourage African voices to speak the loudest on 
this policy.

    Question. What effect has the African Union and international 
community's failure to call General Mahamat Deby's unconstitutional 
seizure of power a coup had on efforts to advocate for a transition to 
a democratically elected, civilian led government in Chad, and what 
steps will you take if confirmed to encourage robust engagement by the 
AU to support a transition?

    Answer. The AU Peace and Security Council (PSC) cited grave 
security threats in Chad following the death of President Idriss Deby 
in April 2021 to justify allowing an 18-month transition to restore 
constitutional government in Chad with clear guidelines that Chad has 
since disregarded. If confirmed, I would engage with the AU PSC and its 
members to advocate for a strong stance to uphold AU directives 
supporting Chad's transition to an elected civilian government.

    Question. What message does the AU's failure to call what occurred 
in Chad a coup and impose appropriate consequences send to other 
military coup leaders, and coup plotters, and what steps will you take 
if confirmed to encourage consistent actions by the African Union in 
response to coups?

    Answer. There are real risks that Chad could set a negative 
precedent for the Africa region if it disregards the clear guidelines 
issued by the AU PSC and fails to ensure an inclusive and credible 
transition to democracy, while still maintaining its AU membership. If 
confirmed, I will advocate with the AU and its members to maintain and 
apply consistent consequences for unconstitutional changes of 
government and to incentivize AU member states to avoid lapses in 
constitutional government.

    Question. While a number of African leaders have reinforced the 
democratic trajectories of their countries by retiring in accordance 
with constitutionally mandated term limits, others have plunged their 
countries into greater instability and uncertainty by seeking 
unconstitutional and illegal third terms. In October, for instance, 
Central African Republic (CAR) President Faustin Touadera illegally 
removed the President of CAR's Constitutional Court after she declared 
Touadera's efforts to engineer a third term unconstitutional. Polling 
by the Afrobarometer consistently shows overwhelming public support for 
term limits, with more than three-quarters of people across Africa in 
favor of holding their presidents to two terms in office.

   Given overwhelming public support for term limits and the evident 
        damage third terms inflict on development, democracy, and 
        stability across Africa, should the African Union do more to 
        prevent third term bids?

    Answer. A fundamental aspect of a democratic society is successful, 
and regular, transitions of power. In recent years, we have witnessed a 
growing number of African leaders refusing to step down after their 
constitutionally mandated terms have expired, and even changing or 
attempting to modify the constitution in order to seek additional terms 
in office.
    Within its own charters, the African Union condemns and rejects 
unconstitutional changes of government. And leaders across the 
continent have echoed such concerns. For example, in July, Botswana co-
hosted a Summit on Constitutionalism and Democratic Consolidation with 
the National Democratic Institute. The summit concluded by issuing the 
Gaborone Declaration in Support of Constitutionalism and Democratic 
Consolidation, which commends the peaceful transfer of executive power 
through credible and inclusive elections and the strengthening of 
democratic practices in a number of African countries. If confirmed, I 
will encourage African Union counterparts to leverage similar events to 
advance our shared commitment to meaningful democratic processes and 
regular transitions of power that reflect the will of the people.

    Question. What steps should the African Union take to dissuade 
Touadera and other leaders from seeking third terms?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the AU to elevate recent 
democracy success stories, such as those of countries that have 
recently completed their first peaceful, democratic transfer of power; 
those who are long-standing democracies; those whose leaders are 
reinvigorating the fight against corruption; and those where democratic 
institutions have been tested and prevailed. U.S. partnership with the 
AU, member states, civil society, and like-minded international actors 
presents the best way to push back against this antidemocratic tide so 
countries can enjoy long-term stability to advance inclusive economic 
growth, create jobs, and improve health and livelihoods.

    Question. What should be the consequences for leaders who insist on 
undoing their constitutions to remain in office?

    Answer. The United States remains committed to democratic 
institutions and processes. It is ultimately up to the people in 
African nations to decide the future of their country, which should be 
done through a consultative, free and fair, and transparent process. 
The United States believes in regular, democratic transitions of power, 
which yield more accountability, stronger institutions, more 
constructive citizen participation in the political process, and less 
corruption.

    Question. What is the African Union's position on the presence of 
foreign mercenaries in Africa? Russian mercenaries working for the 
Kremlin-backed Wagner Group are present in Mali, the Central African 
Republic, Sudan, and elsewhere in Africa. Ethiopian Prime Minister 
Abiy, meanwhile, invited Eritrean mercenaries into Ethiopia to fight 
the Tigrean Peoples Liberation Front (TPLF) in northern Ethiopia. Both 
groups--Wagner and the Eritreans--are responsible for perpetrating 
gross violations of human rights alongside the national armies they are 
aligned with. What steps has the African Union taken to hold these 
mercenaries, and the governments that hired them, responsible for these 
abuses?

    Answer. The African Union Peace and Security Council has recognized 
the threat mercenaries and foreign-backed forces pose to peace and 
stability on the continent and has convened a working group to design a 
framework for regulating the best practices vis a vis private military 
companies (PMCs), recognizing many countries have a legitimate interest 
in seeking external support to resolve security issues. This is a 
serious and sincere effort to which the AUPSC has devoted their own 
resources, rather than being an initiative driven by external donor 
funds. We fully support this effort.

    Question. What will be your top priorities as Ambassador to the 
African Union? What specific steps will you take to encourage the AU to 
do more to prevent democratic backsliding, establish accountability for 
human rights abuses, and resolve conflicts?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the AU to coordinate 
continued efforts to strengthen democratic principles and institutions 
on the continent. At the core of our efforts will be the promotion of 
transparent, effective, and accountable governments, with institutions 
that both empower citizens and respond to citizens' aspirations, while 
simultaneously addressing backsliding and human rights abuses. Strong, 
accountable, and democratic institutions, sustained by a deep 
commitment to respect for human rights and access to justice for all 
people, generate greater prosperity, deliver tangible benefits, and 
meet with greater success in ensuring peace, while enhancing U.S. 
security and economic partnerships. One of the great successes of our 
partnership with the African Union is the progress we have made in the 
health sector. The United States has supported the Africa Centres for 
Disease Control and Prevention CDC (Africa CDC) since 2015, when former 
Secretary Kerry and then-AUC Chairperson Zuma signed a memorandum of 
cooperation on the Africa CDC to formalize cooperation, including 
technical assistance exchanges between the U.S. CDC and the AUC. I 
endeavor to continue building on this important cooperation.

Democracy & Human Rights
    Question. What are the most important actions you have taken in 
your career to date to support democracy and human rights? What has 
been the impact of your actions?

    Answer. As Ambassador to Ghana, in the runup to Ghana's December 
2020 elections, I emphasized to all parties the importance of peaceful, 
free and fair elections, subsequent to political violence at a by-
election in January 2019. When the opposition candidate refused to 
concede the election, I urged him to advance his concerns through 
available legal avenues, which defused a charged situation. I also 
urged the Government of Ghana to investigate election-related deaths. 
These investigations were ongoing at the time I departed Ghana in April 
2021.
    On the human rights front, I spoke out publicly and privately about 
a free and responsible media, including the importance of pursuing the 
investigation of the murder of investigative journalist Ahmed Hussein-
Soule in January 2019. The investigation was ongoing at the time I 
departed Ghana in April 2021.
    I raised a pride flag at my residence in June 2021, an act of 
solidarity with the beleaguered LGBTQI+ community which attracted 
months of threatening social media messages from a local religious 
figure. My team and I remained steadfast in our support for the 
community and continued to raise concerns (with leaders of the 
executive and legislative branches) about the sweeping draft homophobic 
legislation that private members (rather than the government) 
introduced in Parliament several weeks later. Ghana's Attorney General 
has since issued an opinion that several provisions of the draft are 
unconstitutional.
    While Ambassador to the Republic of Congo, I made numerous private 
demarches (including related to AGOA eligibility and our annual reports 
on Human Rights, Trafficking in Persons, and Child Labor) and public 
statements and speeches in support of respect for human rights, free 
and fair elections, democracy, respect for the constitution and rule of 
law, as well as freedom of expression and association, as well as 
ending trafficking in persons and child labor. I believe that as a 
result of my actions and those of others, the Republic of Congo's new 
constitution (of 2015, replacing that of 2002) included term limits 
(when early indications were that there would be no term limits), 
although the term limitation for the incumbent president was reset. I 
raised these topics with officials from other sub-Saharan countries 
both as Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for African Affairs 
and as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Central Africa.
    At Embassy Brazzaville, I created an Eligible Family Member 
position of human rights specialist in the political section. This 
enabled our Human Rights Report to be provide greater insights on the 
human rights situation outside the major cities, in particular with 
regard to the indigenous Baka people. Also in Brazzaville, I continued 
the annual African American film festival, which showed U.S. films that 
modeled peaceful civic action and persistence in the face of 
discrimination. I initiated an annual film festival promoting a free 
and responsible media for press freedom day, which led to the 
commitment on the part of the Government of the Republic of Congo to 
hold a national stocktaking of the state of the media. I revived and 
advanced a multi-year project to have Voice of America transmit in 
Brazzaville, which will provide a credible source of information in a 
largely government-controlled media landscape; the transmission debuted 
in July 2018.
    I organized Embassy election observation missions during my tenure 
in Cameroon, Ghana (twice), and the Republic of Congo, and supported 
other observation efforts from the Bureau of African Affairs. In part 
as a result of these efforts, countries knew that the United States 
valued peaceful and credible processes and that the United States was 
paying close attention.
    While in Ghana as Political Chief, after I saw multiple reports of 
police killings via ``stray bullets,'' I spearheaded a proposal for 
community policing training, that was approved and conducted during my 
time at post. I also became aware of a potential attack on a church 
service during a period in which there was traditional ban on drumming. 
I attended the church service, during which a mob attacked the church 
with cement blocks. I believe my presence as a U.S. diplomat deterred 
the attackers from inflicting worse damage than they did. I 
subsequently raised the attack with government officials in the context 
of religious freedom.

    Question. What issues are the most pressing challenges to democracy 
or democratic development in Africa? These challenges might include 
obstacles to participatory and accountable governance and institutions, 
rule of law, authentic political competition, civil society, human 
rights and press freedom. Please be as specific as possible.

    Answer. Democratic deficiencies contribute to transnational threats 
across the region. Therefore, we must help communities foster 
legitimate, inclusive political systems that respect human rights and 
the rule of law, reduce fragility, mitigate risks of violent conflict 
and instability, deliver services to their citizens, and create 
enabling environments for economic growth. The African continent has 
made important gains in democracy and institution building over the 
last few decades, but those gains have been uneven, are fragile, and 
require support.
    Repressive laws, often in the name of security, restrict freedoms 
of expression and peaceful assembly and undercut efforts to support 
nascent civil society. These laws can provide legal cover for 
harassment of opposition politicians, journalists, and civil society. 
They curb internal dissent, squelch legitimate criticism, and limit the 
development of viable political competition, and as a result, fuel 
grievances that are sometimes addressed violently.
    Although elections are widely accepted as the norm in the region, 
meaningful democracy extends far beyond elections. In many countries, 
corruption is endemic, and state institutions remain weak. In addition 
to corruption, unaccountable public financial management systems 
undermine sustainable economic growth and responsive democratic 
governance.

    Question. What steps will you take--if confirmed--to encourage the 
African Union to place a strong emphasis on adherence to democratic 
principles and the rule of law by member states? What do you hope to 
accomplish through these actions? What are the potential impediments to 
addressing the specific obstacles you have identified?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the AU, as well as AU member 
states, to support democratic institutions, respect for human rights, 
accountability, access to justice, and good governance. This includes 
supporting and improving the effectiveness of the Department of 
Political Affairs, Peace and Security; Office of Legal Counsel; and 
other relevant AU organs, all of which play a critical role to promote 
democratic values within the AU and the region.
    If confirmed, I will also utilize the annual U.S.-AU Commission 
High Level Dialogue to advance support for free and fair elections that 
are peaceful, inclusive governance, transitional justice, protection of 
marginalized populations, and anti-corruption efforts.
    There will be challenges. Capacity remains weak and resources 
scarce within AU institutions. Leaders of some member states do not 
share American values of democracy and respect for human rights, and 
thus, achieving consensus within the AU for these issues could be 
difficult. If confirmed, I commit to identifying influential decision-
makers who share our values and who can help advocate for them as being 
in the best interest of Africa and Africans, by highlighting the impact 
on the investment climate, for example.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to meet with civil society 
members, human rights and other non-governmental organizations and with 
human rights NGOs, and other members of civil society who are seeking 
to engage with the AU?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to meet with civil society members, 
human rights and other non-governmental organizations and with human 
rights NGOs who are seeking to engage with the AU, as appropriate. A 
robust and diverse civil society able to do its work unhindered is 
imperative for a peaceful and prosperous Africa. I will strive to 
empower all Africans, with particular emphasis on women and youth, to 
constructively shape and participate in inclusive social, political, 
and economic environments where they can thrive and contribute to 
sustainable economic development.

    Question. What steps will you take to encourage the AU to 
consistently support genuine political competition in member states?

    Answer. A healthy democracy requires free and fair political 
processes that are peaceful, as well as checks and balances, a free and 
responsible press, respect for human rights, and an engaged civil 
society. If confirmed, I will highlight the shared commitment of 
African nations articulated in documents such as the African Charter on 
Democracy, Elections and Governance as a tool to promote meaningful 
political competition and adherence to democratic norms. I will promote 
robust engagement with African civil society including youth and 
marginalized populations to advance inclusive political and democratic 
processes that welcome the voices of all citizens in political debate.

    Question. Will you and your Embassy team actively support more 
robust actions by the AU related to violations of member states of 
freedom of the press including government efforts designed to control 
or undermine press freedom through legal, regulatory or other measures? 
Will you commit to meeting with independent press from AU member states 
if confirmed?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will commit to meeting with independent 
press from AU member states, as appropriate. A free, responsible press 
remain underpinnings for democracies throughout the world, in order to 
hold elected officials accountable and foster an informed citizenry.

    Question. Will you and your Embassy team actively engage on 
countering disinformation and propaganda disseminated by malign actors?

    Answer. If confirmed, I and my Embassy team will actively engage on 
countering disinformation and propaganda disseminated by malign actors. 
We are working to counter disinformation through Global Engagement 
Center (GEC) counter-disinformation programming across Africa by 
working with local African partners to provide counter-disinformation 
training for journalists, along with exposing, countering, and building 
resiliency to disinformation aimed at undermining the stability and the 
integrity of African democratic systems. As disinformation and 
manipulation work best in a monopolized information space, I will work 
with allies and partners to encourage and promote professional, 
balanced, and fact-based reporting while respecting the independence of 
the media and expose and counter hostile disinformation campaigns.

    Question. Will you and your Embassy team actively engage the AU on 
speaking out on labor rights, including the right to organize for 
independent trade unions in member states?

    Answer. The AU has a long-standing memorandum of understanding with 
the U.N. International Labor Organization (ILO). Among recent 
engagements, in 2021, the African Union (AU), in collaboration with the 
International Labour Organization (ILO), launched the International 
Year for the Elimination of Child Labour in Africa. Since 2018, the 
African Union Commission (AUC), ILO, International Organization for 
Migration (IOM), and U.N. Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) have 
collaborated on a Joint Program on Labor Migration Governance for 
Development and Integration (JLMP). The JLMP identifies challenges in 
many African countries. JLMP priorities include delivering improved 
migration governance services in cooperation with workers, employers' 
organizations, the private sector, recruitment industry and relevant 
civil society organizations. The USAU mission supports these efforts 
and seeks to contribute to advancing labor sector best practices, in 
part through sharing U.S. experiences and expertise.

    Question. Will you commit to using your position, if confirmed, to 
defend the human rights and dignity of all people, no matter their 
sexual orientation or gender identity?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to using my position to defend the 
human rights and dignity of all people, no matter their sexual 
orientation or gender identity. The safety and security of members of 
all marginalized groups, including LGBTQI+ persons, is of the utmost 
importance; therefore, I will ensure our approach within the AU, first 
and foremost, does no harm. I will also urge the AU to develop 
strategies that prioritize regular discussions with local LGBTQI+ 
communities and civil society partners.

Congressional Consultation
    Question. Will you commit, if confirmed, to ensuring that you fully 
brief Members of Congress and/or their staff each time you are in 
Washington for visits or consultations during your tenure as Ambassador 
to the African Union?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to ensuring that Members of Congress 
and/or their staff receive timely briefings when requested, either from 
myself or Africa Bureau leadership in Washington.

Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility
    Question. Earlier this year I convened a hearing on the important 
work of the State Department's Chief Diversity Officer and the 
important role diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility efforts 
play in maintaining our countries' competitive edge on the global 
stage. How do you anticipate fostering diversity, equity, inclusion, 
and accessibility at the U.S. Embassy to the African Union?

    Answer. I am proud that the U.S. Embassy to the African Union and 
our co-located U.S. bilateral Embassy to Ethiopia have a joint 
Diversity Equity Inclusion and Accessibility Council (DEIA Council) 
that has spent the past year establishing itself and is already 
engaging in a range of programming for our community. The DEIA Council 
promotes DEIA values and standards by: developing and implementing a 
range of programs, practices, and systems to improve and increase 
diversity; to promote DEIA training; and build capacity for staff. The 
DEIA Council is led by an Executive Committee (EC) comprised of the 
council co-chairs, primary and backup treasurer, and the five 
subcommittee chairs. The five subcommittees consist of 1) the Data 
Analysis & Institutional Policy Reforms Sub-Committee, which analyses 
various DEIA workplace metrics, 2) the Inclusive Design & Accessibility 
Sub-Committee, 3) the Communications Sub-Committee, 4) the Coordination 
Sub-Committee, which coordinates with HR and other Mission 
organizations, and 5) the Programs and Events Sub-Committee which 
promotes and supports DEIA events, activities, and discussions. Already 
during its first year, the DEIA Council has organized conversations on 
DEIA values, a Juneteenth celebration, and fundraising events. Strong 
unequivocal leadership on DEIA values is critical for progress. I will 
demonstrate that leadership, if confirmed, as I did as Chief of Mission 
in Accra and Brazzaville. I look forward to working with the DEIA 
Council and Embassy community as we promote DEIA values within our 
joint Mission community and with our external partners and 
interlocutors.

    Question. What specifically will you do to prioritize and promote 
diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, while also combating 
racism, discrimination, and inequality among locally employed staff?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to engaging more equitably in 
operations and programming with partners and communities that have 
traditionally been marginalized, excluded, or underrepresented.

    Question. In addition to focusing on diversity, equity, inclusion, 
and accessibility in our workforce, will you commit to engaging more 
equitably in operations and programming, particularly with potential 
partners and communities that traditionally have been marginalized, 
excluded, or underrepresented in ours and others' donor and partnership 
efforts? How do you anticipate utilizing local expertise, knowledge, 
and capacity to meet our foreign policy goals?

    Answer. The State Department relies on new and established 
relationships to meet our foreign policy goals; if confirmed, I intend 
to continue building upon our ties. For example, I will track the 
inclusion of women in USAU representation events and avoid male-only 
panels to the extent possible.



                               __________

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
      to Hon. Stephanie Sanders Sullivan by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. The African Union has mediated peace agreements in 
Ethiopia (2022) and the Central African Republic (2019), and South 
Sudan (2018), and in 2022 it formed a high-level panel with the U.N. 
Secretary-General to respond to security and humanitarian crises in the 
Sahel region. The AU also has authorized or otherwise endorsed regional 
military interventions that aim to stabilize Somalia, the Sahel, the 
Lake Chad Basin, Mozambique, and eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

   As U.S. Ambassador, how would you balance U.S. support for AU 
        leadership on regional peace and security initiatives, while 
        also responding to instances where AU mediations and military 
        interventions have led to flawed outcomes?

    Answer. We believe strongly in the principle of African solutions 
for African problems, and endeavor to support the AU leadership's 
efforts to reduce and resolve conflicts. There are few conflicts 
worldwide that have a perfectly peaceful resolution; all require 
sustained engagement and further mediation after the initial agreement. 
In addition, it is crucial for organizations to undertake ongoing 
monitoring and evaluation and conduct after action reports in order to 
share lessons learned and continuously improve. If confirmed, I would 
bring to bear my own experience doing so, particularly with crisis 
management in the Operations Center.

    Question. What U.S. actions would you advocate in cases where AU 
peace mediation efforts have failed to hold regional leaders 
accountable for mass atrocities committed during armed conflicts, as in 
South Sudan?

    Answer. We consistently raise issues of accountability and 
transitional justice in the course of our diplomacy and offer technical 
and fiscal support as we are able to those lines of effort wherever 
they are welcome. If confirmed, I would strongly encourage the AU to 
give advance notice of consequences and to follow up with imposition of 
consequences as warranted.

    Question. As U.S. Ambassador, would you encourage a greater AU role 
in addressing conflicts in the Sahel and Cameroon? Why or why not?

    Answer. African leadership is a necessary component to effectively 
address root causes of conflicts on the African continent and finding 
sustainable and inclusive solutions. Interventions and solutions 
imposed from outside tend to be less effective. If confirmed, I would 
engage with AU leadership on its criteria for continuing to defer to 
the Regional Economic Communities in the first instance, in line with 
the AU principle of subsidiarity, or deciding to engage in specific 
conflict resolution efforts at the level of the AU.

    Question. Under what conditions, if any, would you advocate a 
change in U.S. policy to support the financing of AU peace operations 
through U.N. assessed contributions?

    Answer. The United States is committed to continued dialogue with 
the AU and its member states regarding sustainable and predictable 
financing for AU peace operations consistent with the terms outlined 
under UNSCR 2320. UNSCR 2320 notes a number of important conditions 
with respect to possible U.N. financing for AU peace operations, 
including expectations regarding burden-sharing by the AU and 
finalization of human rights and conduct and discipline frameworks. If 
confirmed, I would pay particular attention to AU progress on these 
fronts and report on the status to policymakers in Washington, 
accompanied by recommendations developed in consultation with my team.

    Question. Please outline your position, and the Administration's, 
on the AU's decision to mandate member states' collection of a 0.2 
percent levy on imports to finance the AU Peace Fund.

    Answer. The United States is committed to continued dialogue with 
the AU and its member states regarding sustainable and predictable 
financing for AU peace operations and supports the commitments made by 
the AU and its member states towards greater burden-sharing in the 
context of financing these operations. We understand there are 
currently 17 countries using or planning to use the 0.2 percent levy as 
a tool to meet their financial obligations as AU member states, 
including but not limited to their required contributions to the AU 
Peace Fund. The United States is committed to working with our African 
partners to achieve these goals through methods that are consistent 
with their international obligations, to include their WTO obligations.

    Question. Military officers have seized power in several African 
countries in recent years, including Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Mali, 
and Sudan. At least two more African countries have claimed to put down 
military coup attempts. The AU's African Charter on Democracy, 
Elections and Governance pledges ``condemnation and total rejection of 
unconstitutional changes of government.''
    As U.S. Ambassador to the AU, what actions will you pursue to 
encourage African leaders to uphold their commitments to deter 
unconstitutional changes of government, including military coups?

    Answer. The dramatic increase in coups and other unconstitutional 
changes of government over the past few years highlights how weak 
institutions, defined by ineffective governance, endemic corruption, a 
lack of genuine accountability, and limits to political participation, 
can contribute to the deployment of extraconstitutional means to reset 
political cultures. If confirmed, I will work with the African Union 
and member states to build and support democratic institutions capable 
of meeting the needs of their people. Together, we must continue to 
highlight to African leaders that strong, accountable, and democratic 
institutions, sustained by a deep commitment to respect for human 
rights and access to justice for all people, attract desired foreign 
direct investment, generate greater prosperity, deliver tangible 
benefits, and meet with greater success in ensuring peace and long-term 
stability.

    Question. As Ambassador, how would you pursue U.S. efforts to 
isolate Russia diplomatically and respond to its malign activities in 
Africa?

    Answer. The actions of Kremlin-backed forces on the continent and 
Russia's violation of the bedrock principles of sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, which are enshrined in the U.N. Charter, have 
done more to isolate Russia diplomatically than we could hope to 
accomplish through rhetoric alone. Many African leaders see that 
Russia's rhetoric and disinformation do not match its actions, and that 
entities such as the Wagner Group are more interested in extracting 
African resources rather than improving local security and prosperity. 
Only leaders without viable security alternatives have turned to Wagner 
for assistance, and they do so at the cost of their nation. If 
confirmed, I will continue to work with African interlocutors to 
highlight and contrast our agenda of genuine partnership and prosperity 
with Russia's malign intentions.

    Question. The People's Republic of China financed the AU's 
headquarters in Ethiopia and is reportedly building a new headquarters 
for the AU's Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa 
CDC). As Ambassador, how would you seek to counter China's influence 
within the AU?

    Answer. The AU and Africa CDC should seek transparency within every 
partnership, including on infrastructure development. If confirmed, I 
will continue USAU's work to develop and implement transparent, 
respectful, and action-oriented partnerships that are fully aligned 
with both USG and AU/Africa CDC standards and priorities. This would 
include continuing to draw on U.S. comparative advantages in global 
health and development--including leveraging our proven expertise, 
programs, and resources in Africa as well as the U.S.'s global 
leadership in science, technology, and innovation--to engage with AU 
agencies and member states. The AU established a technical working 
group to ensure that the construction of the new Africa CDC 
headquarters was carried out appropriately, and Africa CDC has 
requested that all software--including the building's information and 
data management systems--be handled by an independent group to ensure 
that it is under the strict oversight of the AU. Africa CDC has yet to 
move into the new headquarters but, if confirmed, I will keep a close 
eye on how the situation progresses.

    Question. Many U.S. Missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission African Union?

    Answer. Like at many U.S. Missions, the COVID-19 pandemic affected 
morale at USAU, as did the 2021 ordered departure. Despite these 
challenges, as I understand it, USAU's interagency team has shown its 
resiliency and dedication, maintained high productivity, and worked 
together to improve morale--referring to themselves as a ``small but 
mighty'' team. If confirmed, I commit to leading a Mission that 
prioritizes the morale of its team, and to supporting USDH and PSC 
employees as well as locally engaged staff, as I have elsewhere.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission African 
Union?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will endeavor to continue to improve morale 
at USAU by appreciating and empowering my team, providing strategic 
direction, and ensuring our Mission has the training and staffing 
levels needed for success in the multilateral arena. I would look 
forward to working supportively and inclusively with the talented 
interagency professionals at USAU as well as with our esteemed 
colleagues at the bilateral mission who provide the USAU management 
platform.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission African Union?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to working with the staff of 
five agencies who make up the USAU team. Together, we will renew our 
mission and vision, particularly drawing on the outcomes of the 
upcoming U.S.-Africa Leaders' Summit, aligning our objectives 
articulated in the U.S. Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa and the AU's 
Agenda 2063. I look forward to drawing on the expertise of my team to 
review and improve upon the strategic frameworks of our partnership 
with the AU and prioritize activities where we can have the greatest 
strategic impact.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. Over the course of my 35 years of public service, I have 
learned quite a bit on how to manage and empower staff and have 
developed an inclusive, servant-leadership style. I believe in 
identifying and harnessing the individual strengths and skills of my 
staff to contribute to a collaborative effort to achieve U.S. 
objectives, whereby the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. It is never appropriate or acceptable to berate 
subordinates.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I plan to work closely and collaboratively 
with the Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Mission to the African 
Union. The role is currently occupied by Mika Cleverley, an experienced 
and effective diplomat. If confirmed, I would look forward to working 
with him as a full partner and my top advisor, who can fill in for me 
internally or externally with my complete confidence and authority.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I intend to entrust the Deputy Chief of 
Mission with management of personnel and the administrative platform, 
acting Chief of Mission duties when applicable, and assistance in 
formulating U.S. policy that will have the greatest impact on our 
relationship with the African Union.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.
    Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order to 
encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their 
roles?

    Answer. The Department seeks to empower all staff to succeed 
throughout their careers and is scrupulous about the need for timely 
evaluation reports. If confirmed, yes, I will ensure that supervisors 
provide accurate and timely feedback to all employees in a constructive 
manner, to help them reach their full potential.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I will support and encourage clear, 
accurate, timely, direct, and effective feedback to all employees.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Ethiopia.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our Embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. Much of diplomacy relies on interacting directly with 
foreign interlocutors. Our highly qualified and motivated team at the 
U.S. Mission to the African Union routinely makes key connections with 
important contacts outside of the Embassy walls, including with the AU 
Commission, AU member states, AU organs and international partners, as 
well as think-tanks, academia, and other civil society organizations 
focused on AU matters as appropriate, with extensive travel outside 
Addis Ababa. The current USAU team has demonstrated superb outreach in 
building relationships across the AU, including with far-flung AU 
institutions throughout the continent. If confirmed, I intend to 
continue that approach.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will expect my team at the U.S. Mission to 
the African Union to cast a broad net in terms of diversity of 
contacts, whether in person or virtually, given the geographical 
breadth of the AU and its member states. I would ensure my team 
coordinates with our accredited Embassy when engaging substantively 
with interlocutors based in member states.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in 
African Union institutions?

    Answer. The African Union currently represents a population of 1.3 
billion people. That incredible diversity presents both immense public 
diplomacy opportunities and messaging challenges. The communication 
departments of the AU and its organs strive to reach all their 
audiences, but often lack resources to do so effectively. More 
transparency, interaction with the African press, and citizen 
engagement would serve the AU well in creating a body that has African 
public buy-in and ownership. If confirmed, I would explore ways to 
partner with the AU to enhance its public diplomacy capacity.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
at African Union headquarters?

    Answer. The African Union Commission (AUC) is a friendly 
environment for public diplomacy-focused U.S. diplomats. Resource 
limitations, lack of communication-focused staff, lack of public 
engagement-focused staff, and the U.S. status as an observer state 
rather than a member state can hinder collaboration. USAU public 
diplomacy officers, however, regularly identify opportunities within 
the AUC's own initiatives for strategic support, such as engaging the 
African public on the AU's theme of the year, providing training and 
reporting opportunities for AU Media Fellows, and connecting the AUC's 
Citizens and Diaspora Directorate with African American organizations 
in the United States. If confirmed, I would explore innovative ways to 
increase the following for our social media outreach, keeping in mind 
Africa's youthful demographics, which are trending toward half the 
continent's population being under the age of 25 by 2025.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country Mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. It is a collaborative effort. For messaging to be 
effective, it both must be consistent and sensitive to context. It is 
important for Main State to lead on top-line messaging so that posts 
worldwide are sending a consistent message. In-country Missions then 
can take those messages and tailor them to their particular cultural 
contexts and audiences. It requires two-way communication between posts 
and Washington, a method that our consistently improving communication 
tools are enabling with more efficiency each year.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. The health and safety of all employees of the State 
Department is of utmost importance. I also take the responsibility for 
the health and safety of my team seriously, as demonstrated during 
civil unrest in the Republic of Congo and the pandemic in Ghana. If 
confirmed, I intend to echo the concern and dedication of our Secretary 
of State in ensuring all staff are protected from threats to their 
health and to communicating relevant information about AHIs to my team.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission African Union personnel?

    Answer. I have always believed in the importance of clear, open, 
and timely communication. If confirmed, I intend to talk as openly as 
possible to all personnel at the U.S. Mission to the African Union.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Human Rights report, many 
of the countries within the AU are noted for egregious human rights 
abuses. One of the AU's stated objectives is to promote and protect 
human and people's rights in accordance with the African Charter of 
Human and People's Rights in member states.

   Would you directly address the issue of human rights abuses with 
        the states committing violations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the AU to coordinate 
continued efforts to strengthen democratic principles and institutions 
and respect for human rights on the continent. Promoting democracy, 
civic engagement, and respect for human rights in Africa contributes to 
peace and prosperity, which enhances U.S. security and economic 
partnerships. Invoking the African Union's own standards is an approach 
I believe would be effective in general, while deferring the lead in 
specific cases to my counterparts in the relevant bilateral Embassy and 
appropriate geographical Bureau in Washington.

    Question. In the State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons 
report, a majority of the countries in the AU are Tier 2 or worse for 
failing to meet the minimum standards for the elimination of 
trafficking. Many states fail to identify victims and traffickers, 
provide victim services, prosecute traffickers, and are plagued by 
corruption of officials complicit in trafficking crimes.

   If confirmed, how could you work with AU to combat corruption and 
        complicity in anti-trafficking work regionally?

    Answer. AU members are making progress in addressing corruption and 
complicity, with support of the United States and other partners. If 
confirmed, I will encourage the AUC to reinforce member states' efforts 
to combat human trafficking. In particular, I will highlight the need 
for governments to address corruption and complicity, a shared global 
challenge in the fight against human trafficking, by urging increased 
efforts to investigate and prosecute such crimes, including cases 
involving officials.

    Question. How would you engage with the AU to improve member 
states' ability to protect and provide for victims, while increasing 
the amount and efficiency of investigations, prosecutions, and 
convictions of traffickers?

    Answer. One of the AU's greatest strengths is its ability to 
promote principles that influence and shape the policies of its member 
states. It is also able to elevate the importance of issues, such as 
combatting human trafficking and the protection of human rights. If 
confirmed, I will support AU and member state government efforts to 
inform implementation of anti-trafficking laws through targeted and 
routine trainings as well as coordination on effective use of 
identification and referral mechanisms for trafficking victims. In 
addition, I will work with my team and colleagues in bilateral missions 
to share best practices as appropriate.

    Question. In the State Department's 2021 International Religious 
Freedom report, the member states of the AU make up a diverse assembly 
of religious demography, and many states struggle with allowing for 
religious freedoms for minority religious groups and promoting 
religious tolerance amongst their societies.

   What actions would you take with the AU to mitigate religious 
        violence and promote religious tolerance amongst and within 
        member states?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to promoting respect for the human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of all persons, including promoting 
religious tolerance within the AUC and AU member states. I commit to 
working with the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious 
Freedom to engagement with the AU on religious freedom.
    I will also work with the AU to develop strategies on violence 
prevention and the promotion of religious tolerance and as well as 
engage in discussions with religious leaders and civil society 
partners. I will raise religious freedom and tolerance and related 
issues in the context of broader human rights and democracy concerns 
wherever possible.

    Question. How could you engage with the AU to increase cooperation 
within the member states on improving religious freedoms?

    Answer. Africa is dynamic, where identity, including religious 
identity, is complex and multifaceted. The region also prides itself 
not just on religious tolerance, but on religious pluralism. If 
confirmed, I commit to work with the Ambassador-at-Large for 
International Religious Freedom to support the AUC in its efforts to 
advance and promote religious freedom throughout the continent.
    Advancing respect for human rights fundamental freedoms are 
critical to achieving peace and long-term stability on the continent. 
If confirmed, I will engage with the AU on the positive role religion 
can play in conflict transformation, reconciliation, and advancing 
respect for human rights. Promoting religious freedom also specifically 
contributes to strengthening tolerance and respect among religious 
groups and people of all beliefs (whether atheists, Christians, 
Muslims, indigenous groups, or any others). If confirmed, I will also 
seek to amplify African voices in support of religious freedom and 
tolerance across the continent.

    Question. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) 
in the State Department's bureau of International Organizations is 
leading a whole-of-government effort to identify, recruit, and install 
qualified, independent personnel at the U.N., including in elections 
for specialized bodies like the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU). There is an American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who if 
elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. 
She is in a tough race that will require early, consistent engagement 
across capitals and within the U.N. member states.

   If confirmed, do you commit to demarching the member states 
        governments and any other counterparts necessary to encourage 
        their support of Ms. Bogdan-Martin?

    Answer. I am pleased Ms. Bogdan-Martin was elected on September 29, 
2022. The U.S. Mission to the AU played an important role in 
encouraging massive support for her candidacy from AU member states. If 
confirmed, I commit to mobilize my team in similar efforts to advance 
key U.S. candidacies in multilateral fora.

    Question. If confirmed, how can you work with the International 
Organizations (IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify, recruit, 
and install qualified Americans in positions like the Junior Program 
Officer (JPO) program at the U.N.?

    Answer. The Junior Professional Officer program is one of the key 
opportunities offered by the U.N. to encourage young professionals 
interested in serving in international organizations, and it provides 
them with hands-on experience across various U.N. agencies. If 
confirmed, I will coordinate closely with my colleagues in the 
International Organization Affairs Bureau and other stakeholders to 
ensure we have sufficient resources, tools, and staffing to support 
more positions for American citizen JPOs in the U.N. system. With these 
resources, we can work strategically to increase the number of JPO 
opportunities funded by the U.S. Government into key agencies and 
bodies that work on U.S. priorities, expand our recruitment and 
outreach activities to ensure these opportunities are widely known and 
available to interested U.S. citizens, and provide tools and services 
to strengthen our competitiveness in placing qualified American 
citizens into the U.N. system.

    Question. Many AU countries have a low rate of voting coincidence 
with the U.S. in the U.N. General Assembly and in the Security Council. 
What is your assessment of this issue?

    Answer. The Bureaus of African Affairs and Near Eastern Affairs are 
working to improve this, in concert with desks and posts to develop 
support through capitals--with promising results. The U.N. General 
Assembly Resolution on Territorial Integrity in October is one example. 
If confirmed, I will lead my team in supportive efforts with AU member 
states.

    Question. If confirmed, what concrete actions can you take to 
engage with the member states on anticipated votes in the U.N. system 
that would increase their voting coincidence with the U.S.?

    Answer. If confirmed, my team and I will closely coordinate with 
the Bureaus of African Affairs and Near Eastern Affairs which, in turn, 
closely coordinate with the Department's other bureaus to discuss 
anticipated votes and maximize multilateral campaigns in capitals and 
elsewhere to increase voting coincidence.

    Question. Do you believe that the U.N. Security Council should 
finance AU peacekeeping missions without express authorization from a 
majority of the Security Council? Why or why not?

    Answer. We are working with the African Union and its member states 
to explore options for predictable and sustainable financing for AU-led 
peace support operations, in line with prior U.N. Security Council 
resolutions. UNSCR 2320 stresses the primacy of U.N. Security Council 
oversight for any operations that are authorized by the UNSC, 
consistent with Chapter VIII of the U.N. Charter. The resolutions do 
not leave open the possibility of financing operations absent a U.N. 
Security Council authorization.

    Question. Do you commit to ensuring that any financing to any AU 
peacekeeping mission is authorized explicitly by the Security Council?

    Answer. We are working with the African Union and its member states 
to explore options for predictable and sustainable financing for AU-led 
peace support operations, in line with prior U.N. Security Council 
resolutions. Specifically, UNSCR 2320 stresses the primacy of U.N. 
Security Council oversight for any operations that are authorized by 
the UNSC, consistent with Chapter VIII of the U.N. Charter. The 
resolutions do not leave open the possibility of financing operations 
absent a U.N. Security Council authorization, so I commit to ensuring 
that any financing to any AU peacekeeping mission is authorized 
explicitly by the Security Council.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
       to Hon. Stephanie Sanders Sullivan by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. As we speak, the Party is 
cracking down on unprecedented student protests across the country. 
With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry, the CCP 
could stop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. Yes, as laid out clearly in the President's National 
Security Strategy, we recognize that the People's Republic of China 
(PRC) is the greatest geopolitical challenge that we face, because it 
is the only competitor with the intent to reshape and remake the 
international order, and increasingly has the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological capability to do so.

          Question. In your response to my question for the record 
        (``In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic of 
        China is the `only country with both the intent to reshape the 
        international order and, increasingly, the economic,

        you responded: ``Yes, as laid out clearly in the President's 
        National Security Strategy, we recognize that the People's 
        Republic of China (PRC) is the greatest geopolitical challenge

        capability to do so.''


     In your answer you recognize the PRC as the greatest geopolitical 
            challenge the U.S. faces?

     How will your policy implementation of ``Africa policy is about 
            Africa'' take into account and influence your recognition 
            that the PRC is the greatest challenge we face?

          Answer. We understand the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and 
        the PRC Government as inextricably linked. As noted in my 
        previous response and as mentioned in the President's National 
        Security Strategy, we recognize that the People's Republic of 
        China (PRC) is the greatest geopolitical challenge that we 
        face, because it is the only competitor with the intent to 
        reshape and remake the international order, and increasingly 
        has the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological 
        capability to do so.
          Our policy towards Africa is to advance U.S. interests, which 
        include checking the PRC and Russia. Our strategic approach is 
        to focus on how the U.S. and Africa can best partner in areas 
        of mutual interest, while pointing out threats to the rules-
        based order, global standards, accountable democracy, 
        sustainable economic prosperity, and peace and security posed 
        by the CCP and PRC as well as by Russia and its proxies such as 
        the Wagner Group. If confirmed, I intend to work with the AU 
        Commission to prevent further democratic backsliding; reinforce 
        the progress many African countries have made on 
        democratization, human rights, and governance; and ensure 
        democratic ideals and practices are most attractive and 
        compelling to African Governments and their people--in stark 
        contrast to the approach offered by the PRC.
          If confirmed, I also intend to engage vigorously with the AU 
        Commission, AU organs, and AU member states to shape African 
        views and influence African positions in multilateral fora as 
        they are being formed, including to reinforce the rules-based 
        order and secure U.S. candidacies, cognizant that our 
        competitors are working to advance their own interests. I would 
        seek high-level engagements on the continent to implement 
        commitments made during the U.S.--Africa Leaders Summit of 
        December 2022. Many of these commitments, such as our renewed 
        and expanded partnership in tackling the food security crisis; 
        strengthening health systems and preparing for the next 
        pandemic; building a strong and inclusive global economy; 
        supporting accountable governance and respect for human rights; 
        and advancing peace and security, serve to counter malign 
        influence, while also promoting U.S. interests and advancing 
        our shared objectives in support of the AU's Agenda 2063.

    Question. Does the CCP undertake any activities that are beneficial 
to U.S. interests?

    Answer. Support for U.N. Peacekeeping operations is in the U.S. 
interest. Behind the United States, the PRC is the second largest 
financial supporter of peacekeeping operations. It also contributes as 
the 10th-largest troop-contributing country, with about 2,200 troops 
and police officers in missions to Mali, Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, and South Sudan. The PRC also has staff officers in staff 
positions across U.N. missions and key senior leader billets.

     Are you familiar with the 2020 bipartisan annual report to 
            Congress from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review 
            Commission findings which found that China leverages its 
            influence in the U.N. Peacekeeping system to advance its 
            economic goals?

     How will you counter PRC leverage and influence across U.N. 
            missions in Africa?

     Are you familiar with a finding in the same 2020 bipartisan 
            report which highlighted the Chinese Governments political 
            influence in the U.N. to advance its economic objectives in 
            South Sudan? As the report highlighted, ``A key instance 
            where the Chinese Government seems to have used its 
            political influence in the U.N. to advance its economic 
            objectives is South Sudan. China currently has 1,072 
            peacekeeping personnel deployed in South Sudan and the 
            China National Petroleum Corporation controls a 40 percent 
            stake-the largest of any stakeholder-in a consortium that 
            extracts South Sudan's oil. In 2012, the Chinese Government 
            dispatched its first combat unit to the continent to 
            support the U.N. Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). After 
            civil war broke out in the country in 2013, Beijing played 
            a significant role in increasing the UNMISS authorized 
            troop strength and modifying UNMISS's mandate to include a 
            broader interpretation of the U.N.'s nonintervention 
            policy. In this expanded mandate, Beijing successfully 
            lobbied for a provision to include the protection of 
            workers on oil installations. Although the provision 
            initially encountered resistance from officials in the U.N. 
            Department of Peacekeeping Operations, who argued the 
            change would undermine the U.N.'s neutrality and place 
            peacekeepers on the side of the South Sudanese Government 
            and the oil industry, the mandate expansion was ultimately 
            adopted unanimously by the U.N. Security Council in 2014. 
            According to Mr. Meservey, the new mandate ``effectively 
            aligned'' peacekeepers with the South Sudanese Government 
            and the country's oil sector, and by extension, Beijing's 
            economic interests. A year after the mandate was expanded, 
            Beijing deployed 700 PLA combat troops to support the 
            peacekeeping mission.''

     Which CCP U.N. Peacekeeping activities and operations in Africa 
            are in the U.S. interest?


          Answer. Thank you for referencing the 2020 bipartisan report, 
        with which I am now familiar. I intend to discuss in depth how 
        to address the issues raised in the report with the Department 
        of State's new Office of China Coordination, to advance U.S. 
        objectives with the African Union Commission and its Member 
        States and counter harmful behavior by the PRC and other actors 
        across the board, if confirmed.

          This new office, inaugurated immediately following the U.S.-
        Africa Leaders Summit, brings together a group of China experts 
        from throughout the Department and beyond to work more 
        effectively with colleagues from every regional bureau and 
        experts in international security, economics, technology, 
        multilateral diplomacy, and strategic communications. If 
        confirmed, I would work with the Office of China Coordination 
        to advance U.S. interests related to the PRC in the context of 
        the African Union Commission and its Member States. I would 
        also coordinate closely with colleagues working multilateral 
        issues related to Africa in U.N. institutions, such as U.N. 
        peacekeeping operations, including with colleagues at the U.S. 
        Mission to the U.N. and with Addis Ababa-based like-minded 
        members of the U.N. Security Council, which at any given time 
        includes three rotating seats from African Union Member States.

          U.N. peacekeeping operations are critical to securing U.S. 
        interests on the continent, and the significant PRC burden-
        sharing with respect to financing those operations bears close 
        scrutiny. I strongly believe that the PRC's contributions to 
        specific peacekeeping operations warrant continuous monitoring, 
        from the outset to deployment, to prevent the PRC from 
        exploiting those operations to further its interests.

          As the second-largest financial contributor to U.N. 
        peacekeeping operations and the tenth largest contributor of 
        peacekeepers worldwide, the PRC contributes around $1.2 billion 
        to these missions. The PRC has 1,741 peacekeepers deployed to 
        five U.N. peacekeeping missions in Africa (UNMISS, MINUSMA, 
        MONUSCO, UNISFA, and MINURSO). Its contributions include 
        specialized units including police, engineers, field hospitals, 
        helicopter units, as well as the infantry battalion in the 
        Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). Some of these contributions 
        help Missions achieve their mandates. For example, the Chinese 
        helicopter unit in the U.N. mission in Abyei (UNISFA) provides 
        the Mission with most of its air lift capacity, which enables 
        the Mission to respond to threats, move personnel, and resupply 
        troops. That said, I am also keenly aware of the challenges 
        that PRC involvement in U.N. peacekeeping may pose to U.S. 
        interests, including the PRC's efforts to advance its own 
        narrow economic agenda, and, if confirmed, I will be vigilant.

          As outlined by Secretary Blinken, our approach to the PRC is 
        to invest at home, compete with China to defend our interests 
        and build our vision for the future, and align with allies and 
        partners with shared interests and who are opposed to China's 
        authoritarian system and overseas development policies. There 
        are many areas where we compete with the PRC in Africa. If 
        confirmed, I will contest vigorously where PRC engagement 
        undermines U.S. interests and our mutual interests with the 
        African Union Commission and its Member States. I will avail 
        myself of the expertise resident in the Office of China 
        Coordination to inform our approaches with our African partners 
        for maximum effectiveness, as well as of the expertise residing 
        in the State Department's Global Engagement Center.

    Question. Do you believe there are any areas within which the CCP 
would constructively work with the United States in good faith?

    Answer. I recognize the way the U.S. and the PRC manage our 
relationship in the coming years will have significant consequences for 
the entire world. This is why competition with Beijing will not 
preclude cooperation in areas where our interests intersect.
    In Africa, we continue to explore options where the interests of 
the United States and the PRC align. This includes areas such as public 
health, counternarcotics, counterterrorism, food security, and the 
environment.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China in 
the African Union?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would support joint activities where 
interests align, in consultation with Washington.

    Question. Africa has been among the most significant targets of the 
CCP's Belt and Road initiatives, with hundreds of billions of loans 
given to African Governments. Meanwhile, U.S. assistance to these same 
countries is hamstrung by ``woke'' priorities that direct investment 
towards small-scale, gender-based, and green energy initiatives instead 
of the major development and infrastructure projects these countries 
desperately need to bring their populations out of poverty.

   If confirmed, will you coordinate with other U.S. envoys to the 
        region and convey to this administration of the critical need 
        to provide development assistance to African counties that can 
        effectively compete with Chinese aid? Please explain.

    Answer. Though our relationship with the PRC is among the most 
complex and consequential of any in the world, our Africa policy is 
about Africa, not about the PRC. Certainly, if confirmed, I will work 
hand in glove with our U.S. ambassadors across the continent. The 
affirmative agenda of the United States is to strengthen our 
partnerships with African nations and demonstrating our commitment to 
the advancement of African economies that simultaneously support 
American jobs. If confirmed, I would seek to advance the Partnership 
for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which unlocks billions of 
dollars to deliver quality, sustainable infrastructure that makes a 
difference in the lives of Africans; strengthens and diversifies our 
supply chains; creates new opportunities for American workers and 
businesses and advances our national security. I would also work with 
the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation to advance 
development goals or mutual benefit to the United States and AU member 
states.


                                *  *  *

              follow up to the previous question submitted
                   to amb. sullivan by senator rubio
          Question. In your response to my question for the record 
        (``Africa has been among the most significant targets of the 
        CCP's Belt and Road initiatives, with hundreds of billions of 
        loans given to African Governments.'') you responded: ``Though 
        our relationship with the PRC is among the most complex and 
        consequential of the any in the world, our Africa policy is 
        about Africa, not about the PRC.'' Please elaborate with 
        specificity regarding what ``Africa policy is about Africa'' 
        entails. Many African countries the United States courts 
        through diplomacy in Africa have accepted billion of PRC loans 
        for infrastructure, have agreed to allow the PRC sole access to 
        significant rare earth materials and mines, and are in various 
        stages of negotiations for increased PRC naval port access or 
        PRC naval port construction for military purposes.

     How does ``Africa policy is about Africa'' plan to address and 
            counter the significant PRC influence upon military, 
            economic, and diplomatic efforts on the continent?

      Does ``Africa policy is about Africa'' consider other foreign 
            actors we can partner with, or currently partner with, when 
            collaborating on U.S. policy?

     Does ``Africa policy is about Africa'' consider other foreign 
            malign actors, such as Russia or it's Private security 
            contractor Wagner Group, when developing U.S. policy 
            considerations?

          Answer. If confirmed, I intend to coordinate with other U.S. 
        envoys to the region on the critical importance of development 
        assistance and economic statecraft to our overall partnership 
        with African countries. I intend to enhance cooperation with 
        the AU Commission in the areas of accountable governance and 
        human rights, so that the AU can fulfill its potential as a 
        norm-setting institution, in an effort to prevent further 
        democratic backsliding, to shore up the progress many African 
        countries have made on democratization, human rights, and 
        governance; and to ensure that democratic ideals (and not those 
        offered by the PRC) are most attractive and compelling to 
        African Governments and their people.
          Our policy towards Africa is to advance U.S. interests, which 
        include checking the PRC and Russia on the continent. If 
        confirmed to be Ambassador to the African Union, I recognize 
        the immense opportunity I would have in this regard with the 
        African Union Commission and the several dozen AU Member 
        States. Our approach is to enhance our partnership with the 
        African Union and African countries to jointly address shared 
        challenges, which include countering PRC efforts to undermine 
        shared values on accountable democracy, human rights, free 
        markets, and environmental stewardship. For maximum influence 
        with African audiences, experience has shown it is usually most 
        effective to conduct our most direct conversations about the 
        negative influence of the PRC behind closed doors.
          However, during my tenure as Ambassador to Ghana, I also 
        spoke out publicly against IUU fishing and illegal gold mining, 
        deforestation, and wildlife trafficking in Ghana, all widely 
        known to be carried out largely by PRC nationals. Also, during 
        my tenure there, my Embassy submitted a proposal for Economic 
        Support Funds to address environmental and water resource 
        degradation caused by illegal mining in Ghana. The proposal was 
        to fund an alternate, more objective means of monitoring and 
        exposing illegal mining, as currently the only monitoring tools 
        are furnished by the PRC. If confirmed, I will continue to 
        bring information about the PRC's illicit activities to the 
        attention of our African partners, and encourage influential 
        local leaders to express their concerns about malign PRC 
        activity publicly.
          Africans want partnership with the United States to be 
        genuinely in our mutual interests, as opposed to appearing to 
        be primarily a proxy for geopolitical rivalry. We find the most 
        effective public approach is to showcase the overwhelmingly 
        positive story of the U.S.--African partnership, highlighting 
        our sustained investments that benefit the African people, from 
        public health programs like PEPFAR and CDC engagement on the 
        continent, to high-impact Millennium Challenge Corporation 
        compacts. This approach helps us encourage more transparent 
        business climates that will attract further U.S. trade and 
        investment, bringing principled companies that model fair labor 
        practices, build local capacity, respect the environment, and 
        practice corporate social responsibility.
          If confirmed, I look forward to playing a role in 
        implementing the Memorandum of Understanding between the United 
        States and African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) 
        Secretariat, signed during the US--Africa Leaders Summit in 
        December. This MOU is one of only three such agreements (the 
        others being with the PRC and the UK). Along with U.S. 
        colleagues in Washington and Addis, while Ambassador to Ghana I 
        had worked on initial efforts toward the MOU with the Accra-
        based AfCFTA Secretariat.
          Demonstrating the generosity of the American people and 
        strengthening meaningful partnerships in areas of mutual 
        interest will make the United States an increasingly attractive 
        partner of choice to African Governments and their 
        constituents. The United States and its democratic and 
        altruistic values appeal to African civil society and--very 
        significantly--to young people in Africa, who are part of a 
        burgeoning youth bulge heading for one of every four people on 
        the planet to be an African by 2050. We will work with the 
        Department's Global Engagement Center to amplify accurate 
        narratives about the U.S.-Africa partnership, build capacity 
        among African civil society and media, and improve resilience 
        to information manipulation from state and nonstate actors, 
        including the PRC.
          An ``Africa policy for Africa'' envisions partnership that 
        not only overtly leverages our strengths, but also helps to 
        mitigate negative malign influences such as those of the PRC 
        and Russia, particularly those that degrade democracy, peace 
        and security, and economic prosperity. For example, the PRC 
        threatens coastal livelihoods and food security for many 
        African nations via its Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated 
        (IUU) fishing carried out by its trawlers.
          While I was Ambassador to Ghana, Ghana hosted Obangame 
        Express 2021, AFRICOM's multinational exercise in the Gulf of 
        Guinea. The exercise enhanced the maritime security capacity 
        and interoperability of African partner navies from Morocco to 
        Namibia, to counter such illegal fishing practices. This is one 
        of many examples of how our partnership, leveraged with 
        resources and other like-minded partner nations, can have a 
        significant positive impact on Africa while advancing U.S. 
        interests. As I noted in my speech at the opening ceremony, 
        ``Piracy and other illicit maritime activities threaten 
        development efforts, weaken state security, and rob states of 
        precious resources needed for greater economic growth and 
        effective governance. At its worst, such illicit activities can 
        destabilize regions and create pockets for terrorism to thrive. 
        Our shared goals of a secure, stable, and prosperous Africa 
        benefit not only our African partners and the United States, 
        but also the entire international community. And collaboration 
        with our African, European, North and South American partners 
        plays a key role in maintaining that security.''
          In addition to the United States, 22 African nations 
        participated in Obangame Express 2021, alongside ten like-
        minded partners from Europe and the Americas. Activities 
        spanned the spectrum of maritime security issues. In fact, 
        during the exercise, a French vessel interdicted maritime 
        vessel NAJLAN in the Gulf of Guinea, leading to the seizure of 
        approximately 6,068 kilograms of cocaine. This real-life 
        success, based on information from multiple international law 
        enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
        Administration, via the Maritime Analysis and Operations 
        Center-Narcotics (MAOC-N) in Lisbon, exemplifies the continued 
        importance of coordinating with our like-minded partners and 
        building capacity with our African partners.
          Having observed Ghana's use of Chinese-provided patrol boats, 
        I took a personal interest in steering Ghana towards the 
        acquisition of two U.S. Coast Guard patrol boats through the 
        Excess Defense Articles program. The U.S. vessels are expected 
        to arrive in Ghana in a few months.
          In multilateral settings like the African Union, it is 
        essential to partner with other countries to build consensus, 
        support, and momentum for shared priorities. For example, the 
        United States worked closely with Senegalese President Macky 
        Sall as AU President to develop an approach, as outlined in the 
        ``U.S.-AU Joint Statement on Food Security,'' to diversify 
        Africa's food supply chain and enable resilient, sustainable, 
        and productive food systems. This partnership also included a 
        Food Security Ministerial and summit with the AU and the 
        European Union to marshal the resources needed to save lives in 
        the immediate term, as well as to help countries build their 
        own capacity for resilient, sustainable agricultural production 
        over the longer term. If confirmed, I will continue to promote 
        the Global Food Security Strategy, including with like-minded 
        partners, with the AU, as I did in Ghana while Ambassador 
        there.
          The United States made significant strides in ending the 
        acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic--providing nearly $20 
        billion for the global response, distributing more than 670 
        million doses of safe, effective vaccines to over 115 
        countries. As Ambassador to Ghana, I was personally present on 
        the tarmac to receive every shipment of some nine and a half 
        million doses of the lifesaving vaccine the United States 
        donated to Ghana, including on Christmas Eve. I ensured our 
        robust public diplomacy around U.S. pandemic relief eclipsed 
        the earlier, highly publicized, far more modest contributions 
        of personal protective equipment from the PRC. I also led our 
        interagency participation in Ghana on the Global Action Plan, 
        which brought together dozens of countries to get shots in 
        arms, to bolster health supply systems, and to combat 
        misinformation and disinformation. If confirmed as Ambassador 
        to the African Union, I will continue my passion for advancing 
        our Global Health Security Agenda, while countering malign PRC 
        actions and influence.
          Through the G7 and other multilateral fora, the United States 
        collaborates closely with our partners on the continent. We 
        routinely engage with the G7 on issues regarding disinformation 
        campaigns by foreign actors, peace and security efforts, 
        particular in the Sahel, and coordinated sanctions campaigns 
        against organizations and individuals that threaten democracy 
        and economic progress in Africa. While serving as a Deputy 
        Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of African Affairs, I 
        represented the United States with G-7 Africa Directors as we 
        coordinated common positions in preparation for the G7 Summits 
        in 2017 and 2018.
          The United States supported AU-led talks that led to the 
        cessation of hostilities between Ethiopia and Tigrayan forces, 
        working closely with the AU Commission and the three countries 
        of the AU's High-level Panel, Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. 
        If confirmed, I will join colleagues in engaging with partner 
        countries and organizations to support these multinational 
        efforts towards a lasting peace, which is crucial to U.S. 
        interests in the Horn of Africa.
          As diplomats, we consider all actors in the foreign policy 
        arena and scrutinize malign actors such as the Wagner Group, 
        which enter countries in conflict under false pretenses and end 
        up driving greater insecurity, exploiting precious minerals, 
        sowing disinformation, and diverting scarce host country 
        resources that could be used for more effective security and 
        development purposes. I have held many conversations with 
        African officials on the topic of malign influence.

                                *  *  *


    Question. In past years, the African Union has stepped up to lead 
multi-national operations against terrorists in Somalia, Comoros, and 
Sudan. These military missions are critical allies and resources which 
multiply the effectiveness of U.S. special forces operations in Africa 
without dedicating the level of resources invested in past 
interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

   If confirmed, what will you do to ensure the African Union is able 
        to maintain the capability to continue these anti-terrorism 
        missions, which serve to prevent terrorist groups from becoming 
        powerful enough to attack the American homeland?

    Question. If confirmed, I will continue U.S. support for the 
ongoing development of the African Union, the Peace and Security 
Council, and AU member states' ability to lead multinational operations 
against terrorists to the maximum extent allowed by the resources and 
authorities allocated to us by Congress.

    Question. To your knowledge, has the CCP indicated an interest in 
supporting African Union missions?

    Answer. The Department is aware of sporadic PRC support for African 
Union peace operations and related initiatives. For instance, the PRC 
has provided sporadic equipment to the African Union Mission in Somalia 
(AMISOM), now African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS). The 
PRC has also supported the African Standby Force. Nonetheless, PRC 
support for African-led peace operations is substantially smaller-scale 
and less reliable than the significant support the United States has 
provided to AMISOM and other African-led missions in such locations as 
Darfur, Mali, and Central African Republic. We are also aware of 
equipment quality issues and lack of follow-on support to effectively 
receive and sustain the pre-positioned equipment at Douala.



                               __________

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
      to Hon. Stephanie Sanders Sullivan by Senator John Barrasso

    Question. During your testimony you said, ``If confirmed, I will 
work closely with the AU on addressing the impacts of climate change 
and help support a just energy transition through programs like Power 
Africa.''

   If confirmed, what initiatives would you promote dealing with 
        climate change?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would focus on supporting climate 
adaptation and mitigation in Africa. Seventeen of the twenty most 
climate-vulnerable countries are in Africa, and the continent is 
experiencing more extreme climate-related events that threaten its 
people and infrastructure, such as the recent flooding seen in Nigeria 
and Cameroon, and the fourth consecutive year of drought in the Horn of 
Africa. These detrimental impacts of a changing climate could diminish 
African economic growth and exacerbate conflict or climate migration. 
To help African partners adapt to a changing climate, President Biden 
announced $150 million in new funding for climate adaptation in Africa 
at COP27, focusing on expanding availability of early warning systems, 
facilitating access to adaptation finance, expanding risk-based 
insurance, and crowding in private sector investments to climate-
resilient food security in Africa. This complements preexisting Africa-
focused programs that integrate climate adaptation, such as USAID's 
investment of $300 million in Resilient Food Security Activities in FY 
2022 across Africa that supports agricultural development and food 
security.
    If confirmed, I would also work across the U.S. interagency and 
with the AU to promote a just energy transition in Africa that expands 
energy access to Africa's citizens while also promoting a path to 
decarbonization and economic growth, supporting clean energy programs 
for development, and strengthening energy security.

    Question. What is your definition of a ``just energy transition?''

    Answer. All of Africa, with a population of 1.3 billion people, 
accounts for a little more than three percent of total global 
electricity generation.
    Africa has the potential to play a leading role in the global 
energy transition toward a net-zero future. The continent's geographic 
diversity holds huge potential for solar, wind, and geothermal power, 
and its crustal rocks host many of the critical minerals needed for 
clean energy technologies. Pillar IV of the U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-
Saharan Africa addresses the ongoing energy transition, one that must 
be just to be successful, and appreciates that priorities such as 
rapidly expanding energy access and affordability, energy security and 
resilience, industrialization, job creation and business formation, are 
particularly trenchant in Africa.
    For Africa, a transition to clean energy is a way to increase 
energy system resilience, reduce electricity costs, reduce exposure to 
fuel supply disruptions and commodity price swings, and grow local 
renewable energy supply chains, all in keeping with global climate 
change. Considering the above, a just energy transition should seek to 
highlight economic benefits of clean energy yet acknowledge the unique 
energy and natural resource circumstances of individual countries.

    Question. The Biden administration is asking countries in Africa to 
``leapfrog'' over traditional energy resources to power itself with 
solar, wind and renewables only. The United States utilized traditional 
energy resources like coal, oil and natural gas to build our economy. 
African nations deserve the same opportunity.

   How important is providing reliable baseload energy in assisting 
        countries in Africa with economic growth, job creation and 
        poverty reduction?

    Answer. Reliable baseload energy is important, and energy matrices 
should have a diverse mix of sources with an increasing proportion 
provided by clean energy sources. Electricity is projected to become 
the backbone of Africa's new energy systems, powered increasingly by 
renewables. Africa is home to 60 percent of the best solar resources 
globally, yet only 1 percent of installed solar PV capacity. Solar PV--
already the cheapest source of power in many parts of Africa--is 
expected to outcompete all sources continent-wide by 2030, and 
renewables could account for approximately 80 percent of new power 
generation capacity by the end of the decade.
    At present, more than 600 million people in Africa, or 43 percent 
of the total population, lack access to electricity, most of them in 
sub-Saharan Africa. Universal access to affordable electricity by 2030 
requires new connections to 90 million people a year, triple the rate 
of recent years. Energy access is critical to economic growth, job 
creation, healthcare, and poverty reduction across Africa.
    In Sub-Saharan Africa, the number of people without access 
increased in 2020 for the first time since 2013. Sub-Saharan Africa's 
share of the global population without access to electricity rose to 77 
percent from 74 percent before the pandemic. Countries such as Ghana, 
Kenya, and Rwanda are on track for full access by 2030 using primarily 
renewable sources, offering success stories other countries can follow. 
Per International Energy Agency (IEA) models, extending national grids 
is the least costly and most prudent option for almost 45 percent of 
those gaining access by 2030. In rural areas, however, where over 80 
percent of the electricity-deprived live, mini-grids and stand-alone 
systems, mostly solar based, are the most viable solutions.

    Question. Africa has the world's lowest levels of per capita use of 
modern energy. As its population and incomes grow, demand for modern 
energy is projected to expand by a third between 2020 and 2030. As 
Africa's industry, commerce and agriculture expand, so too does the 
need for productive uses of energy. IEA models show that energy demand 
in industry, freight and agriculture will grow by almost 40 percent by 
2030.

   What steps will you take to help countries in Africa get access to 
        traditional energy resources to build their economies?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with interagency colleagues to 
support countries across the continent to get access to a full array of 
energy sources with an increased emphasis on clean and renewable 
technologies. Thanks to its vast critical mineral supply, Africa holds 
the key to our global energy transition. That key should also unlock 
real economic opportunity across Africa. Our partnership-focused 
approach in the Power Africa Initiative includes harnessing the 
Department of Energy's 17 National Labs and their expertise in an 
effort to increase energy access through added clean energy capacity. 
The U.S. private sector also continues to be involved in a broad range 
of commercial energy projects in Africa, which the State Department and 
other U.S. Government agencies help facilitate in a manner consistent 
with U.S. international energy engagement guidelines. Yet, the most LNG 
resources in Senegal will be exported; re-investment of revenues for 
clean energy infrastructure is needed to meet electricity access goals,

    Question. In July, the Ugandan President met with the Russian 
Foreign Minister about a 2,000 megawatt nuclear power facility by 
2032.Uganda asked Russia for help in developing a nuclear power plant--
not the United States. The President of Senegal explains that ending 
gas financing for Africa will be a fatal blow. He said, ``At a time 
when several African countries are preparing to exploit their 
significant gas resources, the end of funding for the gas sector, under 
the pretext that gas is a fossil energy, would bear a fatal cost to our 
emerging economies.''

   Given the extensive expertise of the United States in these areas, 
        why isn't our nation partnering with Uganda and Senegal on 
        these projects?

    Answer. The United States stands ready to provide support and 
partnership to those countries around the world that have prioritized 
nuclear in their clean energy and climate plans to address the global 
climate crisis and bolster energy security.
    In Ghana, where I most recently served as Ambassador, my team and I 
facilitated U.S. involvement with a Request for Proposals for 
developing a nuclear energy capability in Ghana. The U.S.-Japan 
partnership with Ghana announced October 26 aims to support Ghana's 
goal of being the mover in Africa for Small Nuclear Reactor deployment. 
U.S. firm NuScale is involved in the feasibility study. Although a 
number of countries on the continent have established partnerships with 
Russia to establish nuclear power facilities, no construction of a 
Russian supported nuclear power plant exists on the ground.
    U.S.-based Kosmos Energy is involved in fossil fuel exploitation in 
Ghana, Senegal, and Mauritania as well as other countries on the 
continent. On Senegal's natural gas fields, we apply our International 
Energy Engagement Guidance which requires review of new carbon-
intensive engagement as guided by the President's Executive Order 14008 
on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad. The United States 
supports efforts to diversify liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies in 
alignment with climate objectives and overall U.S. international energy 
engagement guidance. The goal of U.S. policy in this realm is to ensure 
that the vast majority of U.S. international energy engagements promote 
clean energy, advance innovative technologies, boost U.S. cleantech 
competitiveness, and support net-zero transitions, except in rare cases 
where there are compelling national security, geostrategic, or 
development/energy access benefits and no viable lower carbon 
alternatives accomplish the same goals.
    Initiatives that offer technical assistance on a broad range of 
technology solutions that focus both on near-term opportunities to 
scale up implementation on advanced efficiency and clean energy and to 
engage on promising new technologies including critical minerals, 
energy storage, and clean hydrogen will facilitate a just energy 
transition, that does not leave African countries with sunk investments 
in stranded fossil fuel assets.

    Question. What are the negative implications that could result from 
this partnership with Russia?

    Answer. Russia seeks to gain support and influence in Africa. We 
have already seen in Ukraine and elsewhere how Russia is weaponizing 
energy. Increased dependence on Russia for energy in Uganda or 
elsewhere would not be in the best interests of African states that 
could be subject to coercion in a manner inimical to their own--and the 
United States'--interests.

    Question. China and Russia are gaining support and influence in 
Africa. How can we do better in countering the Chinese and Russian 
influence campaigns in Africa?

    Answer. I think we can best counter non-market behavior and 
illegitimate development goals of the PRC and Russian authorities by 
focusing on furthering our longstanding partnerships with African 
nations and continuing to advance our economic and diasporan 
engagements. If confirmed, I look forward to advancing our shared 
interests with the AU and taking a further step to build 21st Century 
U.S.-African partnerships that expand on and deepen our historical 
engagement. This includes expanding long-term U.S.-Africa partnerships 
to advance shared priorities, amplifying African voices to 
collaboratively meet the era's defining challenges, and leveraging the 
best of America--including our Government, private sector, and civil 
society--to uplift and empower African institutions, individuals, and 
nations. I will focus on leveraging our own Partnership for Global 
Infrastructure and Investment to deliver quality, sustainable 
infrastructure that makes a difference in the lives of African people, 
strengthens and diversifies our supply chains, creates new 
opportunities for American workers and businesses, and advances our 
national security.
    We are working to counter disinformation through the Global 
Engagement Center (GEC) by working with local African partners to 
provide counter-disinformation training for journalists, along with 
exposing, countering, and building resiliency to disinformation aimed 
at undermining the stability and the integrity of African democratic 
systems. Russia is the great threat in the disinformation space. The 
GEC recently released two public-facing bulletins designed to expose 
for foreign audiences the Wagner Group, Prigozhin, and Russia's 
disinformation networks in Africa. We are increasing access to accurate 
information by working with the GEC to partner with local implementing 
partners to strengthen fact-checking across Africa to increase access 
to verified information for African publics.
    We are increasing access to accurate information by facilitating 
trainings and exchange program opportunities for journalists and 
members of the media. We do this through IVLP programs such as the 
Edward R. Murrow Program for Journalists, trainings organized by the 
Global Engagement Center, and programming at the Embassy's American 
Center. We have also organized numerous capacity-building sessions to 
support accurate reporting for journalists. One example includes two 
discussions between journalists in the Central African Republic and in 
Mali to share best practices on how to report on mercenary activity in 
conflict zones. Another includes a joint roundtable with PAS and USAID 
key media contacts on the causes and implications of disinformation and 
how to best reach target audiences with truthful reporting.
    If confirmed, I would make it a high priority to focus my team and 
the interagency on this issue, as well as coordinate with like-minded 
diplomatic partners such as France who are facing the same issue.

    Question. How do you plan to shed light on the terrible practices 
and atrocities committed by China and Russia to African leaders?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue to work with African 
counterparts to highlight and contrast our agenda of genuine 
partnership and prosperity with Russia's and the PRC's malign 
intentions.
    The actions of Russia-backed forces on the continent and the 
Russian Government's violation of the bedrock principles of sovereignty 
and territorial integrity in Ukraine have done more to isolate Russia 
diplomatically than we could hope to accomplish through rhetoric alone. 
African leaders see that Russia's rhetoric does not match its actions, 
and that entities such as the Wagner Group are more interested in 
extracting African resources rather than improving local security and 
prosperity; only the most desperate leaders have turned to Wagner for 
assistance, and they do so at the cost of control over their countries. 
The PRC's treatment of ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang and 
Tibet, along with many other actions, goes against the core tenets of 
the U.N. Charter that Beijing constantly cites and the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. We'll continue to work with our partners 
in Africa to raise our concerns on these issues and call for change--
not to stand against China, but to stand up for peace, security, and 
human dignity. African nations and civil society groups are also 
starting to take measures to ensure that negative practices of the PRC 
and PRC-supported companies are brought to light and that precautions 
are taken to improve transparency and accountability in ways to put 
African growth, development, and environmental conservation first. A 
2021 report by the U.K.-based Business and Human Rights Resource Center 
found 181 human rights allegations connected to Chinese investments in 
Africa between 2013 and 2020, with the highest number of incidents in 
Uganda, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In 
the DRC, President Felix Tshisekedi is reviewing all foreign mining 
contracts, mostly with Chinese companies, with an aim of bringing 
increased scrutiny, and accountability. The U.S. Government will 
continue to support efforts by African Governments that seek to advance 
good governance and inclusive growth and development.

    Question. African nations rely on Ukraine and Russia for grain 
exports. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, these supplies have 
been dramatically disrupted. What impacts have Russia's actions in 
Ukraine had on Africa and food insecurity?

    Answer. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has significantly degraded 
Africa's food security by disrupting supply chains for food 
commodities, fuel, and fertilizer. Several African countries are highly 
dependent on grain exports from Ukraine and Russia. Of particular 
concern, the Horn of Africa faces the world's worst food security 
crisis. The worst drought in over 70 years, highlighted by five poor 
growing seasons to date, may get even worse in 2023. Even if rainfall 
returns to normal, it will take years for communities to recover. 
Nearly 26 million people are currently experiencing ``Crisis or worse'' 
levels of food insecurity in Somalia, Kenya, (northern and eastern), 
and southern and southeastern Ethiopia. Food and nutrition assistance 
in the Horn of Africa could run out by April 2023 without a surge of 
additional funding from the international community.
    Protracted conflict in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria have 
also deepened food insecurity in West Africa, which now faces its worst 
food crisis on record. On May 18, Secretary Blinken convened more than 
30 Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Agriculture, and Development at the 
United Nations in New York to hammer out a plan to address food 
insecurity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, armed 
conflicts, and exacerbated by Russia's unprovoked invasion in Ukraine.
    The United States introduced, and Ministers endorsed, the Roadmap 
to Global Food Security, focused on seven key actions, including 
increasing humanitarian and development assistance, mitigating the 
fertilizer shortage, keeping agricultural markets open, investing in 
climate-resilient agriculture, and coordinating for maximum effect. 
Over 100 U.N. Members have signed onto the Roadmap--including 15 G20 
members.
    The Leaders' Summit on Global Food Security at UNGA further 
confirmed the commitment of leaders to act urgently, proportionately, 
and in concert in line with the Roadmap. Feed the Future has recently 
expanded into eight additional countries in Africa for a total of 16, 
As the U.S. Government's global hunger and food security initiative, 
Feed the Future works hand-in-hand with partner countries to develop 
their agriculture sectors and break the vicious cycle of poverty and 
hunger.

    Question. What is the Administration's strategy for responding to 
the food shortage?

    Answer. Food security is a global, cross cutting challenge and, 
particularly in Africa, it is crucial to listen to and work with 
African leaders to solve this dynamic and complex issue. Through 
collaboration and information-sharing, we can create viable, workable 
solutions.
    In September, the United States, the African Union, and other 
partners hosted the Global Food Security Summit. During his remarks, 
Secretary of State Blinken stated that ``Action is crucial because the 
current crisis is one that no individual country or even group of 
countries can solve alone.'' He also highlighted efforts under the May 
2022 Roadmap for Global Food Security and called on U.N. member states 
to take measures to keep food and agricultural markets open, increase 
fertilizer production, and invest in climate-resilient agriculture.
    During the 2022 U.N. General Assembly, President Biden announced 
the United States would provide more than $2.9 billion in new 
assistance to address global food insecurity. That amount is in 
addition to the $6.9 billion the U.S. already committed this year to 
support global food security, which is largely focused on supporting 
Africa. On short-term fertilizer needs, the United States is supporting 
efforts to bolster availability, efficiency of use, and local 
production.
    The United States is the World Food Program's largest donor, 
providing about half of all contributions thanks to the generosity of 
Congress and American taxpayers. We encourage other countries with the 
capacity to do more to increase their contributions.
    Concerning addressing one of the gravest threats to food security, 
the U.S. was pleased that in mid-November there was agreement to extend 
the deal the U.N. and Turkey brokered between Russia and Ukraine. This 
deal was crucial in getting grain to Africa from Ukraine. It allowed 
grain and other agricultural exports from Black Sea ports, which were 
previously halted when Russia invaded Ukraine, blocked its ports, and 
prevented food shipments.
    The U.S. Government is committed to strengthening global food 
systems and helping countries improve their capacity to produce their 
own food. Our African colleagues have underscored the need for more 
investment in agricultural innovation and sustainability. This will 
require coordination of ongoing efforts as well as attracting more 
private sector investment and tying our efforts to African-led 
initiatives and programs.
    The African Union, in coordination with AU entities, the Regional 
Economic Communities (RECs), and member states, is spearheading efforts 
to address food security through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture 
Development Program (CAADP). According to CAADP and the African Common 
Position on Food Systems, Africa spent US$43 billion on food imports in 
2019, and it is projected to increase to US$90 billion annually by 
2030i. The common position pointed out that despite having 60 percent 
of the world's arable land, Africa on average imports about 40 percent 
of its food.
    U.S. efforts to promote regional food security include supporting 
CAADP's goals of having African suppliers capture a greater share of 
African food consumption. This, in turn, strengthens broad-based 
inclusive economic growth. Women comprise more than 50 percent of 
Africa's agricultural workforce. Roughly 80 percent of food consumed in 
Africa passes through the hands of small or medium enterprises (SME). 
The Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has also emphasized the 
need for trade to be inclusive of women, youth, and small businesses. 
We want to work with the AfCFTA Secretariat as a key vector for 
enhancing intra-African trade and improving value chains in the food 
sector.
    Regarding investments, over the next five years, we hope to work 
alongside Congress on plans to provide funds toward durable 
agricultural production, including through Feed the Future, our 
flagship program to broaden social safety nets, strengthen food 
systems, and improve nutrition. In August, we added eight new African 
partners to this initiative. Through Feed the Future, we are also 
scaling up innovative ways to get drought- and heat-resistant seeds 
into the hands of farmers who need them. We are also distributing 
fertilizer and improving its efficiency so that farmers can produce a 
higher yield while using fewer resources to do so.

    Question. Last year, there were reports that Chinese hackers were 
expected to have been stealing security camera footage from inside the 
African Union headquarters building in Ethiopia. The headquarters were 
built by China. In 2018, it was discovered that the buildings had been 
interspersed with listening devices and the servers would send data to 
Shanghai daily. If confirmed, how do you plan to address China's 
actions at the African Union?

    Answer. The AU established a technical working group to ensure that 
the construction of the new Africa CDC headquarters was carried out 
appropriately, and Africa CDC has requested that all software--
including the building's information and data management systems--be 
handled by an independent group to ensure that it is under the strict 
oversight of the AU. Africa CDC has yet to move into the new 
headquarters but, if confirmed, I will monitor the situation and work 
to mitigate potential harm.

    Question. Our competitors recognize the importance of the African 
Union to increasing their influence on the continent and have robust 
engagement with the AU. The agenda of the United States at our mission 
to the African Union is to strengthen our partnership with the African 
Union and its member states. How do you plan to combat China's 
influence in the African Union?

    Answer. Though our relationship with the PRC is among the most 
complex and consequential of any in the world, our Africa policy is 
about Africa, not about the PRC. The affirmative agenda of the United 
States is to strengthen our partnerships with African nations and 
demonstrate our commitment to the advancement of African economies that 
simultaneously support American jobs.
    If confirmed, I will continue USAU's work to develop and implement 
transparent, respectful, and action-oriented partnerships that are 
fully aligned with both USG and AU/Africa CDC standards and priorities. 
This would include continuing to draw on U.S. comparative advantages in 
global health and development--including leveraging our proven 
expertise, programs, and resources in Africa as well as the U.S.'s 
global leadership in science, technology, and innovation--to engage 
with AU agencies and member states.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
        to Hon. Stephanie Sanders Sullivan by Senator Todd Young

    Question. Last July, AU Commission Chair Mahamat granted Israel 
observer status to the AU. There is ongoing pressure from a bloc of 
members, particularly by South Africa and Algeria, to again have this 
accreditation withdrawn. What is your assessment of this campaign, 
especially when other members' records have not been subject to the 
same scrutiny?

    Answer. The United States strongly supports Israel's observer 
status to the AU. AU Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat 
accepted credentials of the Ambassador of Israel in July of 2021. A 
number of AU member states objected to the Chairperson's action and 
raised their objection during the Executive Council and Assembly 
meetings of February 2022. During the February 2022 ordinary session of 
the Assembly, AU Chairperson defended his decision, noting that 44 AU 
member states had diplomatic relations with Israel. The African Union 
Executive Council appointed a six-member Head of State committee to 
consult on the issue and report at the 2023 Assembly meeting. The 
United States has consistently supported Israel's observer status to 
the AU and will continue to do so. The African Union firmly supports a 
two-state solution. We believe it is important for countries that share 
this goal to engage with both Israel and the Palestinians. Nations that 
wish to advance peace and stability between the Palestinians will be 
better positioned to do so if they have open and constructive 
engagement with both sides.

    Question. How would you advocate to have Israel maintain its 
observer status, if confirmed?

    Answer. We strongly support Israel's observer status to the AU. 
Israel maintained an equivalent to observer status with the AU's 
predecessor organization, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) until 
the transition to the AU in 2002. Further, we note, as referenced by AU 
Commission Chairperson in his February 2022 remarks to the AU Assembly 
Heads of State and Government, that 44 AU member states have 
established bilateral diplomatic ties with Israel and many have ongoing 
economic relationships. We have shared our consistent support for 
Israel's expanding diplomatic relationships globally with the 
leadership of African Union member states, as we have elsewhere.

    Question. Provided the AU confirms Israel's observer status when it 
revisits this issue next year, what will you do, if confirmed, to 
ensure Israel is treated fairly before this body?

    Answer. The U.S. Mission to the African Union has engaged the AU 
and other stakeholders to make clear our strong support for Israel's 
observer status, while respecting the AU's process, and will continue 
to do so. If confirmed, I will continue to engage with Israeli 
diplomatic representatives and advocate for the U.S. administration's 
position on this issue with AUC and AU member state officials, as well 
as confer with relevant counterpart U.S. Chiefs of Mission.

    Question. In your testimony, you speak to the U.S. commitment to 
AU's Agenda 2063. How does Agenda 2063 conflict with China's Belt and 
Road Initiative?

    Answer. The world recognizes the important leadership of the AU and 
that the AU is a key partner for engagement in Africa and facilitating 
economic relationships in a region of the world with a burgeoning 
population. The People's Republic of China (PRC) has a dedicated 
Mission to the AU that provides substantial assistance and conducts 
robust diplomatic and economic engagement.
    We do not seek to contain or inhibit China's legitimate development 
goals or market-based industry or trade. We also respect African 
nations' choice to have a variety of partners. However, when Chinese 
companies, especially those that are financed by the PRC, lack 
transparency, disregard workers' rights and environmental standards, 
and are willing to engage in corrupt business practices then these 
firms and the PRC institutions that support them are not advancing the 
continent's economic and development goals consistent with the AU 
Agenda 2063. A 2021 report by the U.K.-based Business and Human Rights 
Resource Center found 181 human rights allegations connected to Chinese 
investments in Africa between 2013 and 2020, with the highest number of 
incidents in Uganda, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and the Democratic Republic of 
Congo. If confirmed, I would highlight how such approaches seriously 
undermine the AU's Agenda 2063 roadmap for a more prosperous and 
peaceful Africa.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to support the AU's vision 
of a ``prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens'' 
when that vision is conflicting with PRC's Belt and Road Initiative?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to advancing our shared 
interests with the AU and taking a further step to build 21st Century 
U.S.-African partnerships that expand on and deepen our longstanding 
engagement. This includes expanding long-term U.S.-Africa partnerships 
to advance shared priorities, amplifying African voices to 
collaboratively meet the era's defining challenges, and leveraging the 
best of America--including our government, private sector, and civil 
society and the diaspora--to uplift and empower African institutions, 
individuals, and nations. I will focus on leveraging our own 
Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment and Development 
Finance Corporation to deliver quality, sustainable infrastructure that 
makes a difference in the lives of African people, strengthens and 
diversifies our supply chains, creates new opportunities for American 
workers and businesses, and advances our national security.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
             to Henry V. Jardine by Senator Robert Menendez

    Question. The UK recently announced that is willing to negotiate 
with Mauritius over the status of the Chagos Islands, which hosts a 
military base on Diego Garcia that the U.S. leases from the UK. As 
ambassador, what role will you play in advocating for continued U.S. 
access to Diego Garcia on terms that are consistent with our strategic 
interests?

    Answer. We continue to recognize UK sovereignty over the BIOT. We 
regard the dispute over sovereignty as a bilateral matter and applaud 
the UK and Mauritius as they work together to find a way forward. The 
specific arrangement involving the facilities on Diego Garcia is 
grounded in the uniquely close and active defense and security 
partnership between the United States and the UK. It cannot be 
replicated. If confirmed, I commit to continue to coordinate closely 
with the UK regarding the base on Diego Garcia to ensure continued 
access and use.

    Question. Will you commit to engaging with members of the 
Chagossian community that were forcibly expelled from their islands to 
make way for the UK/U.S. bases on issues related to the negotiation 
over the status of the Chagos Islands and its inhabitants?

    Answer. We recognize the UK parliament's efforts to address this 
issue by granting UK citizenship to Chagossians and their descendants. 
If confirmed, I will engage with people of all backgrounds in Mauritius 
and Seychelles, including Chagossians.

    Question. What are the most important actions you have taken in 
your career to date to support democracy and human rights? What has 
been the impact of your actions?

    Answer. As the deputy chief of Mission in Tirana, Albania, I 
focused extensively on fostering democratic institutions in the 
country, which had a legacy of being the most oppressive Communist 
dictatorship in Europe during the Cold War. For example, I led and 
coordinated our Embassy efforts to monitor the national and local 
elections in 2013 and 2015 in conjunction with other international 
partners. As a result of these and other efforts, Albania in 2013 held 
the most free and fair elections to up to that point, experienced no 
violence, and had a peaceful transition of power to the opposition 
party.

    Question. What issues are the most pressing challenges to democracy 
or democratic development in Mauritius and the Seychelles? These 
challenges might include obstacles to participatory and accountable 
governance and institutions, rule of law, authentic political 
competition, civil society, human rights and press freedom. Please be 
as specific as possible.

    Answer. Mauritius and Seychelles are both leaders in Africa when it 
comes to democracy and human rights. Since becoming an independent 
republic in 1968, Mauritius has been a beacon of democratic stability 
in the region, with uninterrupted peaceful transfers of power following 
free and fair elections. Seychelles continues to advance its democratic 
transition, with opposition parties successfully contesting legislative 
elections for the first time in 2016 and for the presidency in 2020. In 
both Seychelles and Mauritius, we see many of the challenges to 
democracy that have been ascendant across the world in recent years. 
While Mauritius has a vibrant free press, the increasing use of strict 
libel laws are having a chilling effect on political dialogue. Despite 
general support for ethnic pluralism, some ethnic minorities do not 
have broad representation in government agencies. In Seychelles, 
notwithstanding much progress, the democratic transition is in its 
nascent stages and remains fragile. The country requires capacity 
building of civil society, media, and government ministries to ensure 
improved good governance.

    Question. What steps will you take--if confirmed--to support 
democracy in Mauritius and the Seychelles? What do you hope to 
accomplish through these actions? What are the potential impediments to 
addressing the specific obstacles you have identified?

    Answer. Supporting democracy has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign 
policy since the founding. If confirmed, I will continue to work with 
democratic partners in Mauritius and Seychelles to reinforce what is 
working well and to help shore up what needs improvement. In both 
countries, this means providing support to the press, NGOs, and a wide 
variety of civil society organizations, while also conversing directly 
with leaders of government, business, and the faith community to 
identify ways to preserve and strengthen our common democratic values. 
Thanks to the hard work of the U.S. Embassy and generations of U.S. 
diplomats assigned to Port Louis, we are fortunate to have an 
extraordinarily expansive and robust network of leaders and influencers 
who are alumni of U.S. training, programs, and universities. If 
confirmed, I will continue to leverage this network to ensure that we 
are both publicly and privately, but always effectively, advocating in 
the cause of strong, vibrant, and healthy democracies that can serve as 
an example to the region.

    Question. How will you utilize U.S. Government assistance resources 
at your disposal, including the Democracy Commission Small Grants 
program and other sources of State Department and USAID funding, to 
support democracy and governance, and what will you prioritize in 
processes to administer such assistance?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will take a holistic approach to ensure 
that grants and programs funded by the U.S. Government result in the 
maximum benefit for our most important policy priorities in Mauritius 
and Seychelles, including the goal of the U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-
Saharan Africa to ``foster openness and open societies'' and ``deliver 
on democratic dividends and security dividends.'' I will ensure that 
State Department and Defense Department offices at the Embassy are 
working hand-in-hand to send the right candidates to our military 
education and training programs. Supporting democracy and the civil 
society institutions that are essential to free and fair elections, a 
vibrant and professional press, and healthy pluralism is a priority of 
our Embassy in Port Louis. If confirmed, I will take advantage of the 
wide array of exchange, training, and educational programs provided by 
the Department of State and other sources to build capacity and 
likeminded networks of influencers in Mauritius and Seychelles. If 
confirmed, I will also prioritize ensuring that the country team, 
especially those offices that handle governance, security, and anti-
corruption efforts, are coordinating their efforts to steward resources 
while advancing U.S. foreign policy and contributing to good governance 
in both countries.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to meet with civil society 
members, human rights and other non-governmental organizations in the 
U.S. and with local human rights NGOs, and other members of civil 
society in Mauritius and the Seychelles? What steps will you take to 
pro-actively address efforts to restrict or penalize NGOs and civil 
society via legal or regulatory measures?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will commit to meet with civil society 
members, human rights and other NGOs in the United States as well as in 
Mauritius and Seychelles. I will meet with groups experiencing undue 
restrictions and seek to highlight U.S. Government support for them and 
their efforts. I will utilize social media or other public diplomacy 
platforms to message U.S. support and concern for these groups or 
individuals, partner with likeminded international organizations or 
embassies to emphasize shared concerns, and engage with relevant 
government officials to emphasize U.S. Government support for civil 
society, human rights, and democratic institutions.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to meet with democratically 
oriented political opposition figures and parties? What steps will you 
take to encourage genuine political competition? Will you advocate for 
access and inclusivity for women, minorities and youth within political 
parties?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to meet with democratically oriented 
political opposition figures and parties. I would encourage genuine 
political competition by meeting with a full cross-section of political 
figures; messaging regularly on the importance of strong democratic 
institutions; partnering with likeminded organizations and embassies to 
coordinate efforts, programs and messages supporting democracy; and 
emphasizing with host government counterparts the importance of 
fulfilling democratic commitments. In addition, I would engage 
underrepresented groups to support their participation in the 
democratic process, and I would advocate for the access inclusion of 
women, minorities and youth within political parties.

    Question. Will you and your Embassy team actively engage with 
Mauritius and the Seychelles on freedom of the press and address any 
government efforts designed to control or undermine press freedom 
through legal, regulatory or other measures? Will you commit to meeting 
regularly with independent, local press in Mauritius and the 
Seychelles?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I would actively engage on freedom of 
the press and address government efforts to control or undermine press 
freedoms. The Embassy in Port Louis is already very focused on this 
issue and works closely with local contacts to message on U.S. 
Government concerns regarding press freedoms. I intend to continue and 
expand on these efforts, regularly meeting with independent, local 
press in Mauritius and Seychelles.

    Question. Will you and your Embassy team actively engage with civil 
society and government counterparts on countering disinformation and 
propaganda disseminated by foreign state or non-state actors in the 
country?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I and the Embassy team will continue to 
actively engage with civil society and government counterparts on 
countering disinformation and propaganda. I will do this in part 
through the Global Engagement Center (GEC), which is working across 
Africa with African partners to provide counter-disinformation training 
for journalists as well as exposing, countering, and building 
resiliency to disinformation aimed at undermining the stability and the 
integrity of African democratic systems.

    Question. Will you and your Embassy teams actively engage with 
Mauritius and the Seychelles on the right of labor groups to organize, 
including for independent trade unions?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I and the Embassy team will be actively 
engaged with Mauritius and Seychelles on the right of workers to 
organize, including to form independent trade unions.

    Question. Will you commit to using your position, if confirmed, to 
defend the human rights and dignity of all people in Mauritius and the 
Seychelles, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I will commit to defend the human rights 
and dignity of all people in Mauritius and Seychelles, no matter their 
sexual orientation or gender identity.

    Question. What challenges do the lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people face in Mauritius and the 
Seychelles?

    Answer. Mauritius and Seychelles are among the more progressive 
African nations in respecting the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons. 
Seychelles reformed its colonial-era legal code to decriminalize same-
sex conduct in 2016, and discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation is banned by law. A provision of Mauritius's colonial-era 
legal code that bans same-sex conduct is currently facing multiple, 
credible challenges in court, and LGBTQI+ persons in Mauritius are 
generally protected from legal discrimination and discrimination in 
employment and the provision of goods. Both countries have civil 
society groups advocating for the wellbeing of LGBTQI+ persons. 
Nevertheless, neither Seychelles nor Mauritius recognizes same-sex 
marriage nor civil unions, and stigma and discrimination against 
LGBTQI+ persons have not been entirely overcome in either country, 
disadvantaging LGBTQI+ persons in housing, health care, and education.

    Question. What specifically will you commit to do to help LGBTQ 
people in Mauritius and the Seychelles?

    Answer. We support efforts around the globe to promote respect for 
the human rights of all individuals, including LGBTQI+ persons. With a 
commitment to ``do no harm,'' we consult local LGBTQI+ organizations 
and activists on where we can be most helpful to prevent violence 
against and abuse of LGBTQI+ persons; combat criminalization, 
discrimination, and stigma; end so-called conversion therapy practices; 
and empower local movements. The U.S. Embassy in Port Louis has strong 
relationships with the leaders and membership of the civil society 
groups advocating for the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons in Mauritius 
and Seychelles. We help fund initiatives by these groups, send rising 
leaders to participate in our exchange and alumni programs, and 
publicly advocate for respecting and protecting the rights of all 
Mauritians and Seychellois. We are also a leader among the diplomatic 
community in Mauritius and Seychelles in championing respect for these 
rights. If confirmed, I will continue and expand these efforts, while 
also ensuring that we report current and accurate information on the 
state of the civil and human rights of LGBTQI+ persons in both 
countries.

    Question. Will you commit, if confirmed, to ensuring that you fully 
brief Members of Congress and/or their staff each time you are in 
Washington for visits or consultations during your tenure as Ambassador 
to Mauritius and the Seychelles?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I will commit to ensuring that I fully 
brief Members of Congress and/or their staff each time I am in 
Washington, D.C. during my tenure as ambassador to Mauritius and the 
Seychelles.

    Question. How do you anticipate fostering diversity, equity, 
inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) among both American and locally 
employed staff at Embassy Port Louis?

    Answer. To foster diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility 
(DEIA) among both American and locally employed staff, I would take the 
following steps, among other efforts: advance the work of the Embassy's 
DEIA committee; ensure that our hiring procedures follow best practices 
for eliminating biases in hiring; engage with the Bureau of Overseas 
Buildings Operations and the Office of Accessibility and Accommodations 
to ensure the new Embassy compound project and existing facilities are 
accessible for those with disabilities; use technologies and other 
resources to ensure public diplomacy and other outreach efforts are 
more accessible for those with hearing, vision or other disabilities; 
and ensure Embassy officials engage a wide variety of individuals and 
that our convened gatherings are inclusive of diverse citizens.

    Question. What specifically will you do to prioritize and promote 
diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, while also combating 
racism, discrimination, and inequality among locally employed staff in 
Mauritius and the Seychelles?

    Answer. To prioritize and promote DEIA, while combating racism, 
discrimination and inequality among locally employed staff, I would 
take the following steps, among others: articulate a clear zero 
tolerance for racism and discrimination in the Mission; ensure that 
hiring practices are consistent with DEIA standards and allow for a 
transparent, equitable and inclusive hiring process; prioritize 
facility projects and programs that facilitate accessibility for 
employees; and insist on regular DEIA training and other activities for 
Embassy employees.

    Question. In addition to focusing on diversity, equity, inclusion, 
and accessibility in the foreign service workforce, will you commit to 
engaging more equitably in operations and programming, particularly 
with potential partners and communities that traditionally have been 
marginalized, excluded, or underrepresented in ours and others' donor 
and partnership efforts? How do you anticipate utilizing local 
expertise, knowledge, and capacity to meet our foreign policy goals?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I will commit to engage equitably in 
operations and programming. I would draw on local expertise to best 
message our policy priorities; identify and reach out to organizations 
and groups that the Embassy may not have previously engaged; and 
broaden our outreach across communities.

             to Henry V. Jardine by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. Some Mauritians have expressed concern about democratic 
backsliding and electoral processes under Prime Minister Pravind 
Jugnauth, who succeeded his father after the latter stepped down in 
2017 due to ill health. As U.S. Ambassador, what actions would you 
encourage Mauritian authorities to take to enhance democratic 
accountability and bolster public faith in the electoral process?

    Answer. Mauritius was a participant in President Biden's Summit for 
Democracy precisely because it is one of the strongest democracies in 
sub-Saharan Africa and has strong democratic foundations. If confirmed, 
I commit to work with the Government and civil society to ensure they 
recognize the implications of any actions that threaten these 
traditions and opportunities for free and fair elections. I will also 
use all the tools the United States has at our disposal to support 
civil society, educate young leaders, and work with the Government to 
continually strengthen and promote our shared democratic principles.

    Question. Mauritius claims sovereignty over the United Kingdom-
controlled Chagos Archipelago, where a U.S. naval and air base is 
located on the island of Diego Garcia. As U.S. Ambassador, how would 
you balance pursuing U.S. national security interests related to Diego 
Garcia while also upholding positive U.S.-Mauritian relations?

    Answer. The United States continues to recognize UK sovereignty 
over the BIOT. We regard the dispute over sovereignty as a bilateral 
matter and applaud the UK and Mauritius as they work together to find a 
way forward. The specific arrangement involving the facilities on Diego 
Garcia is grounded in the uniquely close and active defense and 
security partnership between the United States and the UK. It cannot be 
replicated. The United States continues to enjoy a strong bilateral 
relationship with Mauritius, with extensive cooperation in maritime 
security and economic development. If confirmed, I will work to 
maintain our positive relations and explore opportunities to deepen our 
cooperation on security and in other areas of mutual interest.

    Question. The People's Republic of China has reportedly provided 
extensive development financing to both Mauritius and Seychelles. As 
U.S. Ambassador, how would you seek to counter China's influence in 
Mauritius and Seychelles, including economic and strategic competition 
in the Indian Ocean?

    Answer. The United States continues to expand our bilateral 
engagement with Mauritius and Seychelles to ensure we can be a partner 
of choice in advancing shared priorities. Both Mauritius and Seychelles 
are very receptive to our offers of support in maritime security, 
economic governance, and academic and professional exchanges. If 
confirmed, I will continue to expand our strong diplomatic, economic, 
and security partnerships with both Mauritius and Seychelles as an 
alternative to the PRC.

    Question. Many U.S. Missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Port Louis?

    Answer. Most COVID restrictions have been lifted in Mauritius so 
that is no longer a major issue. Given the relatively high quality of 
life in the country and a clear sense of mission at the Embassy, morale 
at post is strong.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Port 
Louis?

    Answer. While there has been a significant gap between ambassadors 
assigned to Port Louis, morale at post is already strong. I would build 
on the existing positive teamwork and commitment to the Embassy's 
goals. I would engage all Mission offices; actively and regularly visit 
all offices within the Mission; conduct an offsite meeting of office 
leaders early in my tenure to develop our strategic program and to 
promote collaboration; and frequently host community events and 
activities.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Port Louis?

    Answer. From my earliest leadership experiences as an infantry 
platoon leader over 30 years ago, and throughout my assignments in the 
Foreign Service leading large organizations with hundreds of personnel, 
I understand it is important to communicate effectively and frequently 
with the team to create a unified mission and vision. It is critical 
for a leader to articulate the organization's key strategic goals and 
mission, and to ensure the team can provide good, constructive feedback 
on the goals and progress. In addition, it is important to model strong 
personal ethics and behaviors to set organizational expectations.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I would characterize my management style as collaborative 
in seeking input from the teams I lead, but it is also important to 
define expectations, goals, and vision early in an assignment, so that 
everyone in the organization understands their role and feels engaged 
in the Mission. I will also seek to establish a level of organizational 
accountability by establishing clear metrics with team input and to 
periodically review progress against the goals that the team has 
established.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No, it is never productive or acceptable to berate 
subordinates under any circumstances. Performance feedback is important 
but should be done professionally and in line with the Department's 
guidance on performance evaluations and counseling.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. Having served previously as a Deputy Chief of Mission 
(DCM), I understand how critical it is for the ambassador and DCM to 
forge a true partnership. If confirmed, I would see my relationship 
with my DCM as being highly collaborative, ensuring regular 
communication between us. I would also seek to mentor the DCM and 
prepare them to take on even greater responsibilities in their future 
assignments with the Department of State.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. Having served previously as Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), 
I understand the critical role the DCM plays in the Mission. I would 
empower the DCM to coordinate the activities of Mission offices and to 
operationalize our various initiatives and activities, particularly 
those focused on promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
accessibility. In addition, State Department regulations clearly define 
aspects of the DCM's responsibilities, such as developing and 
implementing mentorship programs for first- and second-tour officers as 
well as mid-level personnel. I would also ensure the DCM was prepared 
to lead as appropriate during any brief absence I may have from post.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking. Do 
you believe that it is important to provide employees with accurate, 
constructive feedback on their performances in order to encourage 
improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their roles?

    Answer. Throughout my time in the Foreign Service and in my present 
role as director of career development and assignments for the 
Department's Foreign Service professionals, I understand the value of 
providing accurate and constructive feedback on performance. It 
actually helps those receiving the feedback to understand where they 
may need to focus their professional development. In addition, 
rewarding those who have succeeded serves as a positive reinforcement 
of professional performance and helps to foster organizational morale 
and productivity.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I would support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Greece [Mauritius and Seychelles]. In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats 
get outside of our Embassy walls enough to accomplish fully their 
missions?

    Answer. It can be a challenge to balance the tasks that keep U.S. 
diplomats in the Embassy offices with the need to do outreach in the 
local community. However, I agree that the priority should be for 
diplomats to do more outreach and more engagement outside of the 
office. I would encourage this through my own example and make a point 
of engaging as much as possible with local counterparts, officials, and 
organizations.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. I would seek to improve the ability of U.S. diplomats to 
access local populations by providing the focus and time for them to do 
so. In my own outreach, I would bring along other Embassy officials to 
provide them engagement opportunities so they can initiate and foster 
the critical relationships with the local community. In addition, I 
would encourage a robust Embassy language program to provide the needed 
skills to do the outreach.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in 
Mauritius and the Seychelles?

    Answer. The public diplomacy environment in Mauritius and 
Seychelles is favorable to U.S. values and interests. Both countries 
maintain audiences that are interested in U.S. culture, and American 
educational opportunities remain a gold standard for studying abroad 
for young Mauritians and Seychellois. Social media continues to play a 
growing role in the dissemination of information, with internet 
penetration high in both countries. Media outlets in both Mauritius and 
Seychelles, in general, operate freely, but are subject to strict libel 
laws and policies.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
in the two countries?

    Answer. Current public diplomacy challenges include the active 
presence of our strategic competitors in both countries (including the 
PRC and Russia), the role of online misinformation and occasional hate 
speech, and a press corps in both countries that requires continued 
support to build capacity and develop stronger journalistic standards.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country Mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. Main State and in-country Mission public diplomacy efforts 
should be coordinated to complement each other. Some issues or messages 
may resonate less with local audiences. The Embassy typically has 
expertise on how messages can be best translated or prioritized to 
engage the local community effectively. In these instances, it is 
important to use Embassy personnel, especially local staff, and to 
leverage insights from local civil society to effectively tailor 
messages that advance the State Department's mission.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel. If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat 
seriously?

    Answer. If confirmed, I do commit to taking anomalous health 
incidents seriously, working closely with the State Department's Care 
Coordination Team and bureaus of medical services and diplomatic 
security to safeguard the health and well-being of our employees and 
protect against these events in the future.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Port Louis personnel?

    Answer. Yes, I would commit to talking as openly as possible with 
Mission Port Louis personnel.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
               to Henry V. Jardine by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. As we speak, the Party is 
cracking down on unprecedented student protests across the country. 
With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry, the CCP 
could stop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose. 
Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. As laid out in the President's National Security Strategy, 
we recognize that the People's Republic of China (PRC) is the greatest 
geopolitical challenge that we face. That is especially true in Africa, 
where we actively promote our values, including respect for human 
rights, and contest the PRC whenever it engages in harmful behavior, 
like predatory lending.

    Question. Does the CCP undertake any activities that are beneficial 
to U.S. interests?

    Answer. Evaluating the activities of the CCP would be beyond the 
scope of my duties were I to be confirmed as the United States 
Ambassador to Mauritius and Seychelles. However, it is clear that the 
PRC does seek to counter U.S. strategic interests.

    Question. Do you believe there are any areas within which the CCP 
would constructively work with the United States in good faith?

    Answer. The way the United States and the PRC manage our 
relationship in the coming years will have significant consequences for 
the entire world. That is why competition with Beijing should not 
preclude cooperation in areas where our interests intersect. In Africa, 
the State Department continues to explore options where the interests 
of the United States and the PRC could align. This includes areas such 
as public health, counterterrorism, counternarcotics, food security, 
and the environment.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China in 
Mauritius or the Seychelles?

    Answer. If confirmed, I might support joint activities if interests 
were to align and there was a clear benefit for advancing U.S. 
Government foreign policy goals and interests, such as in areas of 
public health, counternarcotics, counterterrorism, the environment, and 
food security. However, such cooperation would have to be carefully 
considered, done in consultation with and approval by appropriate U.S. 
agencies or offices, and demonstrate a clear benefit to the United 
States, Mauritius, and Seychelles.

    Question. One of the United States' major military bases in the 
Indian Ocean, Diego Garcia, is located in the Chagos Archipelago, with 
the permission of the British Government, which controls the islands. 
Mauritius claims the islands, and last year, the International Court of 
Justice and the United Nations General Assembly passed resolutions 
affirming Mauritius' claims. Should Mauritius regain control of the 
islands, our ability to maintain Diego Garcia and continue military 
operations in the strategic Indian Ocean will be at risk. If confirmed, 
what will you do to ensure that the United States is able to continue 
to operate the Naval Support Facility in Diego Garcia?

    Answer. We continue to recognize UK sovereignty over the BIOT. The 
joint defense facility on Diego Garcia contributes significantly to 
global security. Diego Garcia allows the United States, UK, and our 
allies to conduct operations that support regional stability and 
provide a rapid response to humanitarian crisis. The specific 
arrangement involving the facilities on Diego Garcia is grounded in the 
uniquely close and active defense and security partnership between the 
United States and the UK. It cannot be replicated. We regard the 
dispute over sovereignty as a bilateral matter and applaud the UK and 
Mauritius as they work together toward a mutually acceptable 
resolution. If confirmed, I commit to continue to coordinate closely 
with the UK regarding the base on Diego Garcia to ensure continued 
access and use.

    Question. The United States typically invests far more in its 
physical presence by orders of magnitude than other countries. Some 
would argue that it may be time to revisit these requirements to ensure 
they reflect both the security environment and our operational needs. 
Do you agree, and how should we approach this issue?

    Answer. Yes, I agree that it is time to re-examine these 
requirements. As Secretary Blinken has said, ``A world of zero risk is 
not a world in which American diplomacy can deliver.'' To that end, the 
Department is endeavoring for legislative changes to the Secure Embassy 
Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999. The one-size-fits-all 
nature of the law, especially with smaller posts, does not adequately 
address the realities of varied environments around the world. Amending 
this legislation and introducing other flexibilities would allow the 
Department to evaluate prospective Embassy locations more broadly, not 
only allowing us to decrease costs, but also allowing our diplomats to 
extend their reach and broaden their scope.

    Question. What would you say to those who would that any relaxation 
to these requirements opens our personnel and their families up to 
potential danger?

    Answer. I believe those who join the Foreign Service do so with an 
understanding of the inherent risk in the profession. The Department 
has some of the best minds working to ensure our people are 
strategically managing risks, including potential danger. The 
Department designs and constructs facilities to address both current 
and future threats. The proposed legislative changes would allow us to 
manage risk more strategically in conducting diplomacy.

    Question. How would you sell this decision to my constituents who 
might express sticker shock at these costs?

    Answer. During my tenure as the Principal Deputy Director and 
Acting Director for the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations, I 
grappled first-hand with the impacts of the current one-size-fits-all 
security standard that hampers our ability to conduct diplomacy in the 
most advantageous locations in a cost-effective way. Construction 
limitations, such as restrictions on noise, truck access, and laydown 
areas, combined with the cost of a full setback in a dense urban 
center, especially in the highly developed world, increase the overall 
cost of delivery. If the Department's legislative proposals are 
adopted, the increased flexibility to determine Embassy locations would 
decrease costs.

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. As we speak, the Party is 
cracking down on unprecedented student protests across the country. 
With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry, the CCP 
could stop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. We are in a serious strategic competition with China, which 
is led by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Certain conduct by China 
(1) hurts American workers, (2) blunts our technological edge, and (3) 
threatens our alliances and our influence in international 
organizations.
    I understand that the Biden administration is committed to 
responsible competition with China and pushing back on China's 
aggressive actions and unfair practices that threaten American 
interests.
    The Biden-Harris administration has and will continue to engage in 
a whole-of-government approach to China that uses our available tools 
in a manner that is designed to achieve our economic, national 
security, and foreign policy goals.
    If confirmed, I am committed to work with allies and partners to 
jointly tackle China's activities that can undermine global values and 
norms.

    Question. Does the CCP undertake any activities that are beneficial 
to U.S. interests?

    Answer. As the Administration has stated, China is the only country 
with both the intent to reshape the international order and, 
increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological 
power to do it. Under President Xi, the ruling Chinese Communist Party 
has become more repressive at home and more aggressive abroad. We have 
profound differences with China.
    It is in the United States' interests to stabilize its relationship 
with China while recognizing the wide range of concerns we have with 
its practices.

    Question. Do you believe there are any areas within which the CCP 
would constructively work with the United States in good faith?

    Answer. I believe it is important for the United States and China 
to work together to tackle transnational challenges--from macroeconomic 
cooperation to concerted action on debt relief, the pandemic, food 
security, and climate change. It is in the world's interest for the two 
economies to have the opportunity to exchange views even amid strategic 
competition, and I believe the Chinese Government recognizes the 
importance of that as well.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China at 
the World Bank?

    Answer. I understand the Treasury Department has actively 
discouraged World Bank involvement with China's Belt and Road 
Initiative. If confirmed, I would closely scrutinize any proposed World 
Bank joint activity with China.

    Question. Mr. Gorordo, I understand you have focused on turning 
Miami, our mutual hometown, into the Tech Hub of the Americas. Looking 
at your eMerge Americas organization, I can see potential for the types 
of initiatives that will be critical in building lasting relations 
between the United States and other countries in the Western 
Hemisphere. Unfortunately, there is ample opportunity for the Chinese 
Communist Party to use forums, such as these, to surreptitiously spread 
its influence in our country and others throughout the Americas. While 
you're on the right path, you and others, must ensure that it is not 
subverted by the CCP, which as we speak, is committing a horrific 
genocide against the Uyghur people and cracking down on peaceful 
protests across China.

    Answer. Senator, I share your concern that the atrocities being 
committed by the CCP against the Uyghur people are horrific. I am 
equally concerned about China's use of forced labor of the Uyghur 
people and other minorities. As the White House has said, the United 
States and the world's leading democracies stand united against forced 
labor, and the United States is committed to ensuring that global 
supply chains are free from the use of forced labor.
    I understand that the U.S. Government has tasked agencies to put 
this into action, and if confirmed, I commit to work with all parts of 
the U.S. Government and my fellow Board members to uphold high labor 
standard in projects.

    Question. Last week, Star Xu, a Chinese tech executive was released 
from temporary detention by China's Ministry of Public Security, one of 
the CCP's security organs used to uphold its totalitarian grip on the 
Chinese people. Xu was detained for more than a month, for no stated 
reason, other than he was being ``investigated.'' I raise this because 
Xu is the founder and CEO of OKCoin, one of the sponsors of eMerge 
Americas, your organization. Xu's case demonstrates exactly the problem 
of working with companies subject to the CCP's jurisdiction--in many 
cases these companies are controlled by the CCP through coercion and 
intimidation. Since Xu was detained on October 16, did eMerge Americas 
inquire with the CCP on the details of his detention to ensure one of 
its partners was safe?

    Answer. OKCoin is not a sponsor of eMerge Americas. OKCoin USA, 
Inc., is a sponsor of eMerge Americas. With regards to Xu's case, I 
have never been in contact with Xu and do not know of the details of 
his detention. With that said, I make myself available to be able to 
obtain information regarding the detention.

    Question. In vetting sponsorship offers, does eMergeAmericas ensure 
that sponsors are not compromised or controlled by the Chinese 
Communist Party? Please explain.

    Answer. eMerge Americas does not do business with any entities 
determined to be controlled by CCP. Should an entity that does business 
with eMerge Americas be determined to be controlled by the CCP, eMerge 
Americas will comply with all relevant U.S. laws and regulations.

    Question. If it is determined that OKCoin is controlled by the 
Chinese Communist Party, will eMerge Americas return any money received 
from OKCoin?

    Answer. eMerge Americas does not do business with any entities 
determined to be controlled by CCP. Should an entity that does business 
with eMerge Americas be determined to be controlled by the CCP, eMerge 
Americas will comply with all relevant U.S. laws and regulations.

    Question. If confirmed, what kind of vetting should we expect from 
you when evaluating whether or not the World Bank should lend to 
companies controlled by the Chinese Communist Party?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will vote in accordance with applicable 
U.S. laws and policies. The CCP does not share the World Bank's 
commitment to supporting inclusive development, so I will deeply 
scrutinize CCP involvement in any World Bank-financed project. I 
believe World Bank investments should be based on market principles, 
high standards, and inclusiveness and should avoid contact with 
political parties.

    Question. I understand that you are the founder of Roots of Hope, 
an organization that seeks to develop relationships between American 
and Cuban Youth. During your time in the Obama administration, you 
helped to re-establish diplomatic ties with the Castro regime. After 
the historic protests on July 11, 2021, you and other Cuban activists 
met with President Biden to advise him on how to support the Cuban 
people in overcoming the draconian censorship the regime imposes on 
Cubans.

   Do you acknowledge that the policies you supported during the Obama 
        administration contributed to supporting a regime that, even 
        today, tortures and kills its own people?

    Answer. I have spent my entire life fighting for human rights and 
freedom and I am committed to that cause. As a first-generation Cuban-
American whose family suffered at the hands of a communist totalitarian 
regime, I reject the human rights violations of the Cuban Government 
whole-heartedly. I am deeply committed to honoring, protecting, and 
advancing the cause of democracy, human rights, and economic prosperity 
here and abroad. I abhor the Cuban Government's repression against the 
Cuban people, as my family has paid the price firsthand.
    While I was in college, I co-founded Roots of Hope, a nonprofit 
organization focused on empowering Cuban youth to become the authors of 
their own futures. Through Roots of Hope, I have supported young Cuban 
independent journalists like Yoani Sanchez and young human rights and 
civil society leaders like the late Harold Cepero, who was killed 
alongside Cuban pro-democracy activist Oswaldo Paya in 2012. If 
confirmed, I will work relentlessly to continue to uphold U.S. values 
and advance our interests around the world.

    Question. Do you continue to advocate for re-opening an Embassy in 
Havana, even though the regime continues to detain minors and children 
for participating in the July 11 protests?

    Answer. I understand that The U.S. Embassy in Havana has remained 
open since the United States and Cuba re-established diplomatic 
relations in 2015. The Department of State is gradually increasing the 
number of staff at U.S. Embassy Havana as part of Department of State 
efforts to facilitate diplomatic and civil society engagement while 
ensuring the safety of our personnel., and that the State Department 
has committed to increasing its staffing, consistent with security 
protocols, in order to provide more services to the U.S. and Cuban 
people. The Administration continues to call for the release of all 
persons, including children, detained during the July 11, 2021 and 
subsequent summer's protests. The Cuban Government should respect 
Cubans' right to speech and peaceful assembly.

    Question. If confirmed, will you uphold standing U.S. law, such as 
the LIBERTAD Act, that prohibits U.S. support to the Castro-Diaz-Canel 
regime?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will represent and vote consistent with the 
U.S. position and U.S. law.

    Question. If confirmed, will you commit to ensuring the World Bank 
is promoting all forms of energy projects across the globe, including 
oil, gas, nuclear and coal?

    Answer. I will review each project on its own merits, assessing the 
country's needs, and the consistency with the World Bank's strategy in 
that country as well as U.S. policies and guidance. I will also ensure 
that projects are consistent with all relevant Board-approved policies 
and each country's country strategy, which ensures that World Bank 
activities provide a coherent and agreed structure.
    I will also rely on Treasury's review team to give me guidance on 
whether the individual projects contain strong environmental and social 
safeguards, and that the projects are consistent with any relevant 
Congressional mandates and Treasury guidance.

    Question. The U.S. Department of Treasury announced plans to end 
support for fossil fuels at multilateral development bank, except for 
exceptional circumstances.

   What are the ``exceptional circumstances'' in which the United 
        States would support a fossil fuel project at the World Bank?

    Answer. I understand that the MDBs support a wide array of energy 
projects that strive to support sustainable energy goals and help 
address energy access issues.
    For the United States, and as Alternate Executive Director, if 
confirmed, I would work to evaluate each project on its own merits, 
assessing the country's needs, consistency with the MDB's strategy in 
that country, and the policies and guidance of its shareholders.
    I understand that the Treasury Department has put on its website 
some guidance that urges the MDBs to limit their support of fossil fuel 
projects. I understand this is consistent with the Biden-Harris 
administration's approach towards supporting more sustainable growth. I 
look forward to learning about the Administration's approach and 
working with the World Bank Management to help ensure that developing 
countries are able to address energy access, in as clean and 
sustainable a manner as possible.

    Question. What actions has the United States taken to end World 
Bank support for fossil fuel?

    Answer. While I'm not in the position right now, I am aware that 
the World Bank supports a wide array of energy projects and that they 
strive to support countries' efforts to have sustainable energy and to 
address energy access issues. I look forward to learning more about the 
World Bank approach and working with you to help ensure that the World 
Bank is funding the most appropriate energy solutions for the 
developing world.

    Question. Do you support the financing of fossil fuel projects at 
the World Bank?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will vote according to applicable laws and 
policies, including the guidance that Treasury recently released 
concerning MDB financing of fossil fuel projects. The World Bank can 
play a vital role in expanding energy access in developing countries 
while at the same time supporting ambitious emissions reduction, 
protecting critical ecosystems, building resilience against climate 
change, and promoting the flow of capital toward climate-aligned 
investments. The World Bank should select energy projects that account 
for the full range of costs and externalities over the lifecycle of the 
project and avoid financing projects that the private sector is capable 
of financing. The World Bank should finance projects that utilize 
technologies providing energy access, while promoting energy 
efficiency, that do not lock developing countries into high-emissions 
trajectories or technologies that may soon be obsolete.

    Question. In a tweet on July 30, 2022, you said ``we must do all 
that we can to combat climate change & sea level rise.''

   If confirmed, what climate change initiatives would you promote?

    Answer. If confirmed to be the next U.S. Alternate Executive 
Director at the World Bank, I will work with Treasury and World Bank 
staff to support the most vulnerable countries and ensure that these 
countries have access to the tools needed to mitigate and adapt to the 
impact of climate change in a sustainable, responsible way.

    Question. If confirmed, would climate change your top priority at 
the World Bank?

    Answer. As I stated in my written testimony, if confirmed, I will 
use my experience to help advance U.S. development, foreign policy and 
national security priorities, and expand markets for U.S. products and 
services. Drawing on my fiduciary experience as an investor, executive 
and board member of both for-profit and nonprofit companies, I resolve 
to be a good steward of our tax dollars to ensure the Bank's programs 
yield the greatest return on investment and uphold our values. I will 
also seek to engage with a diverse range of important stakeholders, 
including Members of both parties, to ensure the interests of all 
Americans are represented in the Bank's boardroom and projects. 
Moreover, I will draw on my two decades of experience in management and 
oversight to promote the greatest degree of integrity, transparency, 
and accountability in the Bank's operations. Mitigating and adapting to 
climate change is fundamental to achieving the World Bank's twin goals 
of poverty alleviation and shared prosperity. It is imperative to 
address all of these priorities in a coherent and coordinated manner.

    Question. There has been some discussion by analysts that Russia 
should be suspended from its membership in the international financial 
institutions.

   Do you support a suspension of Russia's membership in the World 
        Bank? Why or why not?

    Answer. I understand that the Bank has ceased all operations and 
development projects in Russia. There are both advantages and risks to 
suspending Russia's membership in the World Bank. It is important that 
regardless of Russia's status at the Bank that it remain isolated. If 
confirmed, I will work closely with allies and World Bank Management to 
maximize Russia's isolation and deter its ability to exert influence at 
the World Bank.

    Question. After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, the World 
Bank halted funding for projects in Afghanistan.

   Under what circumstances, if any, would you recommend the United 
        States support World Bank projects in Afghanistan under the 
        Taliban rule?

    Answer. I understand that the World Bank has paused its own-funded 
activities in Afghanistan but has recently been providing through the 
Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund support to the Afghan people in 
the areas of basic human needs through U.N. agencies. The international 
community, including the World Bank, should continue examining options 
to responsibly provide support to the Afghan people, while engaging in 
strong due diligence and application of appropriate safeguards to 
prevent the flow of funds to any entity supporting terrorism or other 
acts of violence against the United States.

    Question. Chinese firms are the largest recipients of World Bank 
contracts. Chinese firms won nearly a quarter of investment projects 
between 2016 and 2020.

   What are the risks and challenges posed by the World Bank's 
        reliance on Chinese firms for implementation of its development 
        projects?

    Answer. Competition with China is one of the central challenges of 
the 21st century, including competition with China's economic 
statecraft. As we have seen, supply chain diversification is an 
important global priority for numerous reasons. Investments from the 
World Bank can help with this effort.

    Question. What is your plan to address this issue?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to working with President 
Biden, Secretary Yellen, and Congress to craft an economic and 
diplomatic agenda that promotes economic fairness and democratic 
values. I will work to ensure that the World Bank offers a high-
quality, sustainable alternative to borrowing from China, that there is 
an emphasis on increasing developing countries' capacity to evaluate 
procurement bids and contracts on the basis of quality and value-for-
money, and for investments in responsible efforts at supply chain 
diversification. I will also advocate for robust resourcing for the 
World Bank's Integrity Unit, so that firms and individuals found to 
have engaged in corruption are restricted from MDB procurement 
opportunities.

    Question. Through the Belt and Road Initiative, the Chinese 
Communist Party offers countries the ability to borrow a lot of money 
for infrastructure projects. The problem is that these countries 
accumulate large amounts of debt to China, they are unable to pay back, 
while still not achieving the development gains they were seeking. 
Unable to escape the massive debt owed to China, countries face default 
or the forfeiture of strategic assets and natural resources.

    Question. What actions do you believe the World Bank should take, 
if any, to assist countries facing default and economic collapse due to 
China's predatory lending?

    Answer. I fully share your concern about the increasing debt 
vulnerabilities many of the poorest countries face. The World Bank can 
play an important role in assisting countries with building debt 
management capacity, promoting debt transparency through debt data 
collection and reporting, and supporting countries participating in 
debt relief initiatives, such as the G-20 Common Framework.

    Question. How would you ensure American taxpayers are not bailing 
out Chinese financial intuitions and further enabling China's predatory 
lending practices?

    Answer. If confirmed, I pledge to call attention to China's 
predatory lending practices through the voice and vote of the United 
States on the World Bank's Board of Directors. Furthermore, I will 
advocate for the World Bank assistance to countries with building debt 
management capacity, promoting debt transparency through debt data 
collection and reporting, and supporting countries participating in 
debt relief initiatives, such as the G-20 Common Framework.

    Question. What are the biggest challenges developing countries 
across the globe face from China's predatory lending practices?

    Answer. As Secretary Yellen has said, ``Today, nearly 60 percent of 
low-income countries are at high risk of or are in debt distress. This 
over-indebtedness poses a risk to stability and growth at a time when 
financial pressures are mounting. Without timely and orderly debt 
relief, we worry that many developing countries may face severe 
economic fallout.''

    Question. As the bank's largest contributor, the United States has 
a duty to ensure American taxpayer resources are used wisely. I believe 
China should not be receiving any loans from the World Bank.

   Do you support ending all lending to China at the World Bank?

    Answer. I understand that the World Bank made a series of 
commitments on graduation as part of its 2018 capital increase. If 
confirmed, I will encourage the World Bank to adhere to those 
commitments, in coordination with the U.S. Executive Director and 
Treasury colleagues.
    I believe China meets the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development's criteria for graduation, given its high per capita 
income, institutional capacity, and ample access to other sources of 
finance.

    Question. If confirmed, what actions will you take to ensure no 
more US taxpayer funding goes to China at the World Bank?

    Answer. I believe the PRC meets the IBRD's criteria for graduation, 
given its high per capita income, institutional capacity, and ample 
access to other sources of development finance. If confirmed, I will 
press for the PRC's graduation as soon as possible, and will seek to 
advance this position by working with the U.S. Executive Director, 
World Bank Management, Secretary Yellen and Treasury Colleagues, 
Congress, and other U.S. agencies, as well as likeminded partners.

    Question. How much funding has China received from the World Bank 
since it met the bank's graduation criteria?

    Answer. I understand that as per China's current country 
partnership framework (CPF) with the World Bank, which runs from World 
Bank FY 2020 to FY 2025, the lending it receives will average about 
$1.0-$1.5 billion per year and gradually decline during the CPF period.

    Question. What is the process at the World Bank for graduating 
countries? What reforms would you recommend to the current process?

    Answer. My understanding is there is not a formal process for 
graduating countries from IBRD lending, and that graduation from IBRD 
lending is effectively voluntary. World Bank Management assesses 
countries' readiness for graduation based on sustained per capita 
income about the graduation discussion income threshold, 
creditworthiness and access to other sources of finance, and 
institutional capacity. However, a number of reforms were agreed as 
part of the 2018 Capital Package negotiations that move IBRD borrowers 
that exceed the per capita income threshold that triggers discussions 
on graduation in the direction of graduation. These include (a) reduced 
lending volumes, (b) narrowed scope of activities financed to focus on 
the institutional strengthening needed for graduation, and (c) higher 
loan prices. I will continue to press for transparency in assessments 
of graduation readiness and targeting assistance on addressing 
constraints to graduation. In the case of China, I will work with the 
U.S. Executive Director and others in the U.S. Government to press for 
the PRC's graduation as soon as possible.

    Question. Which countries have met the criteria for graduation but 
still receive loans from the World Bank?

    Answer. I believe the PRC has met the criteria. I understand there 
are several other countries that have per capita incomes above the 
graduation discussion income threshold but in most cases, do not have 
sufficiently robust access to other financing sources on reasonable 
terms and/or lack institutional capacity to sustain graduation. If 
confirmed, I will advocate for transparency in assessments of 
graduation readiness and targeting assistance on addressing constraints 
to graduation.

    Question. What countries are close to graduating?

    Answer. I understand there are several countries that have per 
capita incomes above the graduation discussion income threshold but in 
most cases, do not have sufficiently robust access to other financing 
sources on reasonable terms and/or lack institutional capacity to 
sustain graduation. If confirmed, I will advocate for transparency in 
assessments of graduation readiness and targeting assistance on 
addressing constraints to graduation.

    Question. The World Bank recently partly guaranteed a Ghana bond 
which is expected to complicate the country's debt workout. In 2015, 
Ghana issued a $1 billion bond due in 2030.

   What is the expected outcome of this partial guarantee?

    Answer. My understanding is that the Treasury Department is closely 
monitoring the matter. The outcome will depend on how the World Bank 
interprets the relevant provisions of the bond contract.

    Question. What was the outcome the last time the World Bank issued 
a similar guarantee?

    Answer. The World Bank has issued only one other guarantee to 
Argentina in 1999 and chose not to demand immediate reimbursement 
following Argentina's default.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
                to L. Felice Gorordo by Senator Ted Cruz

    Question. On March 11 of 2016 you participated in a political event 
with then-Assistant to President Barack Obama and Deputy National 
Security Advisor Ben Rhodes. The event was publicly described as a 
``Town Meeting on the Future of U.S.-Cuba Relations with Young Cuban 
American Business People and Students,'' with a news conference to 
follow afterward. Mr. Rhodes publicly promoted the event and described 
it as in line with the Administration's ``process of normalization'' 
with the Cuban regime, and cited arguments about U.S. businesses 
engaging Cuba. In his public post regarding the event, Mr. Rhodes cited 
a narrative ostensibly written by you about traveling to Cuba in 2015.

   Do you believe that promoting economic normalization between Cuba 
        and the United States is in the national security interests of 
        the United States?

   Do you believe that promoting economic normalization between Cuba 
        and the international community is in the national security 
        interests of the United States?

    Answer. I have spent my entire life fighting for human rights and 
freedom and I am committed to that cause. As a first-generation Cuban-
American whose family suffered at the hands of a communist totalitarian 
regime, I reject the human rights violations of the Cuban Gpovernment 
whole-heartedly. I am deeply committed to honoring, protecting, and 
advancing the cause of democracy, human rights, and economic prosperity 
here and abroad.
    While I was in college, I co-founded Roots of Hope, a nonprofit 
organization focused on empowering Cuban youth to become the authors of 
their own futures. Through Roots of Hope, I have supported young Cuban 
independent journalists like Yoani Sanchez and young human rights and 
civil society leaders like the late Harold Cepero, who was killed 
alongside Cuban pro-democracy activist Oswaldo Paya in 2012. If 
confirmed, I will work relentlessly to continue to uphold U.S. values 
and advance our interests around the world.
    As President Biden has stated, I believe the U.S. should ``continue 
to stand with the Cuban people, who have suffered for decades and 
decades under a failed communist regime.'' I believe that it is in 
national security interests of the United States to actively pursue 
measures that will both support the Cuban people and hold the Cuban 
regime accountable.

    Question. Do you believe that the Cuban regime would use additional 
resources to promote anti-American movements in the Western Hemisphere? 
Do you believe that the Cuban regime would use additional resources to 
promote violence against American interests in the Western Hemisphere?

    Answer. The Biden administration has made clear that it will not 
provide support to the Cuban military, intelligence, or security 
services. Cuba is not a member of the World Bank, and does not receive 
resources from it. If confirmed, as the Alternate Executive Director, I 
will represent and vote consistent with U.S. positions and U.S. law at 
this institution.

    Question. Please list all officials who were or did serve in the 
Government of Cuba with whom you met while visiting Cuba in 2015.

    Answer. In August 2015, I attended the raising of the American flag 
ceremony at the U.S. Embassy in Havana as a guest of then-U.S. 
Secretary of State John Kerry. I did not have any meetings with 
officials that were or did serve in the Government of Cuba. However, I 
did meet with human rights, civil society and pro-democracy leaders at 
the ceremony at the U.S. Embassy.
    In September 2015, I participated with my late-mother Martha Serra 
Mohr in the Catholic Church pilgrimage for the visit of Pope Francis to 
Cuba. The pilgrimage was headed by the Archbishop of Miami Thomas 
Wenski and organized in part by the international faith-based 
nongovernmental organization Catholic Relief Services. It was the dying 
wish of my mother to return to Cuba for the first time after more than 
40 years when she was diagnosed with late stage pancreatic cancer. The 
Catholic Church and Catholic Relief Services made this trip possible, 
and my mother was personally blessed by Pope Francis two months to the 
day before she was reunited with our Creator. I did not have any 
meetings with officials that were or did serve in the Government of 
Cuba. However, I did meet with Catholic Church leaders as part of the 
pilgrimage.

    Question. Please provide a transcript or recording of your comments 
during the March 11 event with Mr. Rhodes.

    Answer. With regards to the event held at Miami Dade College in 
2016, I have looked for a recording or a transcript, but I have been 
unable to find one. I have also reached out to the Miami Dade College. 
Unfortunately, Miami Dade College has been unable to locate a 
transcript or recording. The basis of my opening statement can be found 
in Medium blog post that was the basis for my opening and closing 
remarks. The basis for Mr. Rhodes' participation in the Town Hall can 
also be found in the White House Archived Medium blog post that he 
authored. Below please find the blog posts and a relevant article by 
press that covered the event:

               follow up to previous questions submitted
                  to l. felice gorordo by senator cruz
          Question. In the QFRs submitted pursuant to your nomination, 
        I asked you for details regarding a March 11, 2016 political 
        event with then-Assistant to the President and Deputy National 
        Security Advisor Ben Rhodes regarding the Administration's 
        ``process of normalization'' with the Cuban regime.
          Specifically, I asked you to provide a transcript or 
        recording of your comments during the event. The event had been 
        livestreamed and in conversations with my staff, you had 
        indicated you would be able to provide a record of your 
        comments, but in your response to the QFRs, you wrote ``With 
        regards to the event held at Miami Dade College in 2016, I have

        the context of that event, whether you believe that promoting 
        economic normalization between Cuba and the United States is in 
        the national security interests of the United States. In 
        partial answer to this question, you cited your work ``co-

        empowering Cuban youth to become the authors of their own 
        futures.''

     Please provide any copies you have of your prepared remarks for 
            the event, e.g. introductions, speech text, etc.

          Answer. I have conducted an exhaustive search of my files 
        both electronic and paper, and I do not have a recording or 
        transcript of my prepared remarks for the event that took place 
        at Miami Dade College.
          My understanding is that the event was live streamed by Miami 
        Dade College. For this reason, I have reached out to Miami Dade 
        College to request any video recording or transcript of the 
        event. Miami Dade College searched their archives and stated 
        that they did not have a video recording or transcript of the 
        event.

                               __________

      Response to An Additional Question for the Record Submitted
             to Richard L.A. Weiner by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. As we speak, the Party is 
cracking down on unprecedented student protests across the country. 
With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry, the CCP 
could stop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. We are in a serious strategic competition with China, which 
is led by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Certain conduct by China 
(1) hurts American workers, (2) blunts our technological edge, and (3) 
threatens our alliances and our influence in international 
organizations.
    I understand that the Biden Administration is committed to 
responsible competition with China and pushing back on China's 
aggressive actions and unfair practices that threaten American 
interests.
    The Biden-Harris administration has and will continue to engage in 
a whole-of-government approach to China that uses our available tools 
in a manner that is designed to achieve our economic, national 
security, and foreign policy goals.
    If confirmed, I am committed to work jointly with allies and 
partners to tackle China's activities that undermine global values and 
norms.

    Question. Does the CCP undertake any activities that are beneficial 
to U.S. interests?

    Answer. As the Administration has stated, China is the only country 
with both the intent to reshape the international order and, 
increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological 
power to do it. Under President Xi, the ruling Chinese Communist Party 
has become more repressive at home and more aggressive abroad. We have 
profound differences with China.
    It is in the United States' interests to stabilize its relationship 
with China while recognizing the wide range of concerns we have with 
its practices.

    Question. Do you believe there are any areas within which the CCP 
would constructively work with the United States in good faith?

    Answer. I believe it is important for the United States and China 
to work together to tackle transnational challenges--from macroeconomic 
cooperation to concerted action on debt relief, the pandemic, food 
security, and climate change. It is in the world's interest for the two 
economies to have the opportunity to exchange views even amid strategic 
competition, and I believe the Chinese Government recognizes the 
importance of that as well.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China at 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development?

    Answer. I understand the Treasury Department has actively 
discouraged EBRD involvement with China's Belt and Road Initiative. As 
the Secretary has said, the Biden Administration is willing to make use 
of the full array of tools to hold China accountable, and, working with 
U.S. allies and partners, including through multilateral institutions, 
to confront China's abusive behaviors. If confirmed, I will do so.
    If confirmed, I would closely scrutinize any proposed EBRD joint 
activity with China.

    Question. Since February 2014, Vladimir Putin has consistently 
supported policies that violate the sovereignty and undermine the 
democracy of Ukraine, most horrifically with the invasion he launched 
earlier this year.

   Do you support efforts to expel Russia from the EBRD?

    Answer. It is absolutely critical that multilateral funds not 
support Russia's unprovoked and illegal war in any way. If confirmed I 
would consider the implications across all international financial 
institutions if the EBRD were to expel Russia.
    I understand that the EBRD Board of Governors passed a resolution 
in April suspending Russia's access to any Bank resources, which 
requires the institution to avoid any new support to Russia. The EBRD 
has also closed its offices in Russia. EBRD management is in the 
process of divesting from its remaining Russian holdings and, if 
confirmed, I will make sure this is done in a way that does not 
inadvertently enrich the Russian regime.

    Question. Beyond expulsion, what other efforts are available to 
sanction Russia at the Bank?

    Answer. Working with our allies and partners, we must be firm in 
our resolve that multilateral funds not support Russia's unprovoked and 
illegal war in any way. If confirmed, I will work to ensure proper 
controls and accountability over the execution of EBRD's projects. If 
confirmed, I understand that there are that are various procedures 
available to prevent any Russian influence over Board decisions, and I 
will work closely with allies and EBRD Management to maximize Russia's 
isolation in the EBRD.

    Question. The United States has the largest single vote in the 
EBRD, but European countries, together, have a majority share in the 
institution.

   If confirmed, how will you utilize America's position at the Bank 
        to lead other shareholders in directing loans away from 
        projects sponsored by the Chinese Communist Party?

    Answer. While the United States is the largest shareholder with a 
10 percent stake and is able to exercise considerable influence over 
Bank policies and operations, U.S. influence at the Bank also depends 
on our ability to build coalitions with likeminded shareholders.
    If confirmed, I commit to exercising the United States' voice and 
vote to advance U.S. interests at the EBRD while also partnering with 
our allies and partners to extend U.S. influence over the institution.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to opposing all EBRD loans to 
projects that are controlled by, or affiliated with, the Chinese 
Communist Party?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will vote in accordance with applicable 
U.S. laws and policies. The CCP does not share the EBRD's commitment to 
supporting transition to market-based economies and democratic 
pluralism, so I will deeply scrutinize PRC involvement in any EBRD-
financed project. I believe EBRD investments should be based on market 
principles and should avoid contact with political parties.

      Response to An Additional Question for the Record Submitted
              to Richard L.A. Weiner by Senator Todd Young

    Question. Article 1 of the EBRD charter says that countries must 
commit to and apply the principles of multiparty democracy, pluralism, 
and market economics in order to qualify for EBRD loans. Do all of the 
countries currently borrowing from the EBRD meet these standards?

    Answer. I understand that the EBRD assesses this commitment as part 
of its development of country strategies for each country and 
calibrates its approach to assistance in those countries that are 
deficient. If confirmed, I will underscore the importance of this 
commitment to the EBRD's mission and promote appropriately calibrated 
approaches in those countries.

    Question. How important do you believe the goals of Article 1 
should be in guiding EBRD lending decisions? Should countries be denied 
loans if they fail to comply?

    Answer. The EBRD has a unique mission to support the transition of 
countries from command economies to multi-party democracies with market 
economies. The EBRD's political mandate as stated in Article 1 of its 
charter makes it unique among development banks. The United States 
views this mandate as a critical element to the EBRD's work in the 
region to promote vibrant and open democracies. If confirmed, I will 
advocate for the EBRD to support countries through all its tools to 
strengthen public institutions, improve public financial management, 
and improve transparency and anticorruption. I will also advocate for 
EBRD to consult actively with civil society groups and implement robust 
safeguards and accountability over its operations. I will use the voice 
and vote of the United States to support projects that uphold these 
values and high standards.

    Question. In EBRD's 31 year history, only the Czech Republic has 
graduated from EBRD borrowing. Are any other countries close to 
graduating?

    Answer. In 2007, the Czech Republic (Czechia) graduated from EBRD 
borrowing; it was the only country to do so. EBRD graduation is a 
country-led process, and I understand that the Treasury Department 
continues to view graduation from EBRD investment as the ultimate 
indicator of the Bank's success in achieving its transition mission. 
Progress toward transition is not always linear, however. I understand 
the Treasury Department has supported a flexible post-graduation 
approach, which allowed the Czech Republic (Czechia), to return to 
borrower status temporarily due to the economic impacts of COVID-19.
    For other countries that are advanced in transition, such as those 
in Central Europe and the Baltics, I will advocate for ensuring that 
EBRD assistance is targeted at addressing remaining transition gaps and 
does not crowd out private investment.

    Question. If confirmed, what criteria would you support to gauge 
whether a country should graduate from the EBRD?

    Answer. I understand that the EBRD assesses a country's transition 
to an open market-oriented economy across six areas: competitive, 
inclusive, wellgoverned, green, resilient, and integrated. A number of 
factors should be considered within these areas in determining whether 
a country should graduate. If confirmed, I pledge to work with EBRD 
management and shareholders to promote a constructive approach to 
graduation.

    Question. Is there a concern that, as the EBRD expands the number 
of countries it operates in that it is spreading itself too thin?

    Answer. I understand that the EBRD's approach to private-sector 
development is unique, would be of great value to African countries, 
where it is currently contemplating a limited and incremental 
expansion, and that the needs are large enough to accommodate 
additional actors on the continent. Geostrategically, it is crucial for 
the United States to assist African countries in their development to 
market economies. If confirmed, I will work with Management and other 
shareholders to ensure any additional expansion is taken in a 
responsible and effective manner, with no loss of focus on its existing 
emerging transition countries. The EBRD's expansion into the Southern 
and Eastern Mediterranean over the past decade indicates it is capable 
of expanding effectively into new, geostrategically important markets 
while still delivering in its existing countries of operation.

      Response to An Additional Question for the Record Submitted
            to Richard L.A. Weiner by Senator John Barrasso

    Question. What are the top five financial contributing countries to 
the EBRD?

    Answer. EBRD's 73 shareholders include 71 countries across five 
continents, as well as the European Union and the European Investment 
Bank. These shareholders have each made a capital contribution, which 
forms the Bank's core funding. The United States is a founding member 
of the EBRD and is the single largest shareholder with a 10 percent 
share of the Bank's capital. The other top financial contributors are 
the United Kingdom, Japan, Italy, France, and Germany.

    Question. What is the total financial contribution from the United 
States to the EBRD?

    Answer. The United States is a founding member of the EBRD and is 
the single largest shareholder with a 10 percent share of the Bank's 
capital. Our total paid-in capital contributions are $636 million.

    Question. What level of influence does the United States have over 
the European Bank for Reconstruction (EBRD) operations and EBRD loan 
policy?

    Answer. While the United States is the largest shareholder with a 
10 percent stake and is able to exercise considerable influence over 
Bank policies and operations, U.S. influence at the Bank also depends 
on our ability to build coalitions with likeminded shareholders. If 
confirmed, I commit to exercising the United States' voice and vote to 
advance U.S. interests at the EBRD while also partnering with our 
allies and partners to extend U.S. influence over the institution.

    Question. Energy is a critical tool to help countries alleviate 
poverty. Yet, multilateral development banks have been imposing 
restrictions on financing of traditional energy projects. These 
restrictions only exacerbate the global inequities of energy. To 
achieve its mission, the EBRD must embrace, not exclude, affordable 
energy resources. Ultimately, the solution to energy poverty does not 
lie in limiting options but in using all available options.

   Should poverty alleviation and economic development be the top 
        priorities at the EBRD?

    Answer. The EBRD has a unique mission to support the transition of 
countries from command economies to multi-party democracies with market 
economies. The EBRD recognizes that poverty alleviation and economic 
development are critical to that transition and are best and most 
sustainably addressed through private sectorled growth.

    Question. When reviewing projects at the EBRD, what criteria will 
you use in determining whether the United States will support energy 
development projects?

    Answer. I will review each project on its own merits, assessing the 
country's needs, and its consistency with the Bank's strategy in that 
country as well as U.S. policies and guidance. I will also ensure that 
projects are consistent with all relevant Boardapproved policies and 
each country's strategy to ensure that Bank activities provide a 
coherent and agreed structure.
    I will also rely on Treasury's review team to give me guidance on 
whether the individual projects contain strong environmental and social 
safeguards and are consistent with relevant Congressional mandates and 
Treasury directives.

    Question. Do you support financing of fossil fuel projects at the 
EBRD? If confirmed, will you commit to ensuring the EBRD is promoting 
all types of energy projects across the globe, including oil, gas, and 
coal?

    Answer. I believe the Bank should carefully consider the total 
costs of energy resources, factoring in the social cost of carbon and 
its short- and long-term effects, particularly its impact on the 
climate by burning fossil fuels. It is important that the Bank is part 
of the solution to climate change by helping countries transition 
toward low-emission growth, decarbonizing their energy generation and 
reaching Paris Alignment, while continuing to promote growth, create 
jobs, and reduce poverty.

    Question. Other development banks, including the World Bank, the 
Asian Development Bank, and even China's Asian Infrastructure 
Investment Bank, are funding projects in EBRD member countries.

   Does the EBRD partner with China on its Belt and Road Initiative? 
        If so, what is your view on that effort and how would you 
        address it?

    Answer. As the Administration and Congress have said, competition 
with China is one of the central challenges of the 21st century, 
including competition with China's economic statecraft. The Bank's 
focus on high development standards and outcomes, as well as its broad 
shareholding by the United States, Europe, and G7 partners, make it an 
attractive alternative to other sources of financing, including from 
China. If confirmed, I look forward to working with President Biden, 
Secretary Yellen, and Congress to craft an economic and diplomatic 
agenda that promotes economic fairness and democratic values. I also 
understand the Treasury Department has actively discouraged EBRD 
involvement with China's Belt and Road Initiative. If confirmed, I 
would closely scrutinize any proposed EBRD joint activity with China.

    Question. How will you ensure EBRD is not duplicating efforts, 
creating redundancies, and working at cross-purposes?

    Answer. The Department of Treasury undertakes extensive 
coordination efforts via the U.S. interagency process and with allies 
and partners to maximize the development impact of assistance provided 
by the EBRD and to avoid redundancies with other development finance 
institutions, notwithstanding different mandates, governance 
structures, and regional focuses of each MDB.

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work closely with U.S. Government 
agencies and other EBRD Board members and Management to advocate for 
strong coordination and cooperation across partners. The EBRD's 
transition mission and strong focus on private-sector and sub-sovereign 
public finance (e.g., municipal services) are its comparative advantage 
relative to other multilateral development banks that provide sovereign 
guaranteed public finance or exclusive private sector support.

    Question. What is your view of the EBRD planned expansion to 
different regions? Does this cause issues of duplication and 
redundancies? Under what scenarios would it be wise for the EBRD to 
move away from its original mandate of helping Ukraine and other post-
Soviet states diversify their economies away from Russia?

    Answer. I understand that the EBRD's approach to private sector 
development is unique, would be of great value to African countries, 
where it is currently contemplating a limited and incremental 
expansion, and that the needs are large enough to accommodate 
additional actors on the continent.
    Geostrategically, it is crucial for the United States to assist 
African countries in their development to market economies. If 
confirmed, I will work with Management and other shareholders to ensure 
any additional expansion is taken in a responsible and effective 
manner, with no loss of focus on its existing emerging transition 
countries, and in coordination with other MDBs already active in those 
markets. The EBRD's expansion into the Southern and Eastern 
Mediterranean over the past decade indicates it is capable of expanding 
effectively into new, geostrategically important markets while still 
delivering in its existing countries of operation.

    Question. As the EBRD expands the number of countries it operates 
in, how will you address the concern the EBRD is spreading itself too 
thin?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with Management and other 
shareholders to ensure any expansion is implemented in a responsible 
and effective manner, without detriment to other EBRD priorities, such 
as Ukraine, and is well coordinated with other MDBs already active in 
any new markets for EBRD. I understand that shareholders and Management 
have emphasized that expansion will be limited and incremental and must 
not come at the expense of support for existing countries of operation 
that are less advanced in transition.

    Question. Article 1 of the EBRD charter requires countries to 
commit to and apply the principles of multiparty democracy and market 
economics in order to qualify for EBRD loans.

   Do all countries currently borrowing from the EBRD commit to and 
        apply the principles of multiparty democracy and market 
        economics? If not, please list the countries that are not 
        meeting the standards outlined in Article 1.

    Answer. I understand that the EBRD assesses each country's 
commitment to principles of multiparty democracy, pluralism, and market 
economics as part of its development of country strategies for each 
country and calibrates its approach to assistance in those countries 
that are deficient, including in some cases limiting assistance to only 
private companies or not investing at all. If confirmed, I will 
underscore the importance of this commitment to the EBRD's mission and 
promote appropriately calibrated approaches in those countries.

    Question. What countries have been denied loans at the EBRD for 
failure to meet the Article 1 standards?

    Answer. I understand that countries that have been subject to 
calibrated approaches include Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, and Belarus. 
More recently, EBRD shareholders decided to suspend all new operations 
in Russia and Belarus and engage in an orderly exit from existing 
investments due to the inconsistency of those countries' brutal and 
unjustified actions in Ukraine with the principles articulated in 
Article 1 of the Agreement Establishing the Bank. If confirmed, I will 
advocate for the EBRD to support countries in strengthening public 
institutions, improving public financial management, and improving 
transparency and anti-corruption efforts. I will also advocate for the 
EBRD to consult actively with civil society groups and implement robust 
safeguards and accountability over its operations. I will use the voice 
and vote of the United States to support projects that uphold these 
values and high standards and promote appropriately calibrated 
approaches in countries not applying the principles.

    Question. What are the criteria used to determine whether a country 
should graduate from the EBRD?

    Answer. I understand that the EBRD assesses a country's transition 
to an open market-oriented economy across six areas: competitive, 
inclusive, well-governed, green, resilient, and integrated. A number of 
factors should be considered within these areas in determining whether 
a country should graduate. If confirmed, I pledge to work with EBRD 
management and shareholders to promote a constructive approach to 
graduation.

    Question. What is the process at the EBRD for graduating countries 
from the EBRD? What reforms would you recommend to the current process?

    Answer. EBRD graduation is a country-led process, and I understand 
that the Treasury Department continues to view graduation from EBRD 
investment as the ultimate indicator of the Bank's success in achieving 
its transition mission. As noted, I understand that the EBRD assesses a 
country's transition to an open market-oriented economy across six 
areas: competitive, inclusive, well-governed, green, resilient, and 
integrated. A number of factors should be considered within these areas 
in determining whether a country should graduate. If confirmed, I 
pledge to work with EBRD management and shareholders to promote a 
constructive approach to graduation.

    Question. Which countries have met the criteria for graduation but 
still receive loans from the EBRD?

    Answer. As noted, EBRD graduation is a country-led process, and I 
understand that the Treasury Department continues to view graduation 
from EBRD investment as the ultimate indicator of the Bank's success in 
achieving its transition mission. Progress toward transition is not 
always linear, however. I understand the Treasury Department has 
supported a flexible post-graduation approach, which allowed the Czech 
Republic (Czechia), the only current EBRD graduate, to return to 
borrower status temporarily due to the economic impacts of COVID-19. 
For other countries that are advanced in transition, such as those in 
Central Europe and the Baltics, I will advocate for ensuring that EBRD 
assistance is targeted at addressing remaining transition gaps and does 
not crowd out private investment.

    Question. What countries are close to graduating?

    Answer. EBRD graduation is a country-led process. Countries in 
Central Europe and the Baltics are considered advanced in transition, 
while Greece is slated to have its status as a temporary country of 
operations end in 2025. I will advocate for ensuring that EBRD 
assistance is targeted at addressing remaining transition gaps and does 
not crowd out private investment in these countries.
    Russia has traditionally been one of the EBRD's largest borrowers. 
The EBRD approved an operational suspension of Russia's access to EBRD 
resources.

    Question. Under what conditions would you support restarting EBRD 
projects in Russia?

    Answer. EBRD projects in Russia can be restarted only if Russia 
meets its commitment to the fundamental principles of multiparty 
democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and market 
economics as outlined in the EBRD's Agreement Establishing the Bank, 
which would include ending its unprovoked and illegal war and 
respecting the territorial integrity of Ukraine.

    Question. Do you support efforts to expel Russia from the EBRD?

    Answer. It is absolutely critical that multilateral funds not 
support Russia's unprovoked and illegal war in any way. If confirmed, I 
would consider the implications across all international financial 
institutions if the EBRD were to expel Russia.
    I understand that the EBRD Board of Governors passed a resolution 
in April suspending Russia's access to any lending, which requires the 
institution to avoid any new support to Russia. The EBRD has closed its 
offices in Russia. EBRD management is also in the process of divesting 
from its remaining Russian holdings and, if confirmed, I will make sure 
this is done in a way that does not inadvertently enrich the Russian 
regime.

    Question. Beyond expulsion, what other efforts are available to 
sanction Russia at the EBRD?

    Answer. Working with our allies and partners, we must be firm in 
our resolve that multilateral funds not support Russia's unprovoked and 
illegal war in any way. If confirmed, I will work to ensure proper 
controls and accountability over the execution of EBRD's projects.
    If confirmed, I understand that there are various strategies 
available to prevent any Russian influence over Board decisions, and I 
will work closely with allies and EBRD Management to maximize Russia's 
isolation in the EBRD.

    Question. The Office of the U.S. Executive Director has in the past 
raised objections with the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD) when the bank invests in a development project 
involving a person on the Specially Designated National (SDN) list of 
entities threatening U.S. foreign policy and national security 
interests. If confirmed, will you commit to using the voice, vote, and 
influence of the U.S. to object to EBRD investments for any project in 
which a Chinese company on the Treasury Department's Non-SDN Chinese 
Military Industrial Complex Companies List (NS-CMIC List) participates 
in?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will represent and vote consistent with 
U.S. positions and U.S. law at this institution. U.S. Policy forbids 
supporting projects in which sanctioned entities participate, including 
those identified on Treasury's sanctions list, such as the List of 
Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, among others.

    Question. Considering Tajikistan has announced it will host an 
Iranian drone factory and is increasing its security cooperation with 
China, how can the United States continue to consider Tajikistan a 
strong partner? It is difficult to make the argument that U.S. 
assistance is producing the desired results in Dushanbe. If such a 
factory is built, should Washington reassess its assistance to 
Tajikistan? And if not, at what point would you recommend our doing so?

    Answer. Tajikistan has limited capacity to handle significant 
border security challenges, and U.S. security assistance is critical to 
mutual counterterrorism and border security goals in the region. I 
understand developments related to Tajikistan hosting an Iranian drone 
factory are being followed closely. If confirmed, I will encourage 
Tajikistan to limit security cooperation with the PRC and halt any 
exchange of military technology with Iran, while enhancing border 
security and counterterrorism cooperation with the United States and 
likeminded partners. This would reduce Tajikistan's reliance on--and 
the influence of--competing actors, while demonstrating U.S. commitment 
to regional security.

    Question. Considering Tajikistan's neutral stance on Ukraine and 
Iranian drones' use in the conflict, do you think there is a diplomatic 
opportunity to encourage Tajikistan to halt any actions supporting the 
Iranian factory?

    Answer. I believe the U.S. can continue to encourage Tajikistan to 
cease cooperation with any Iranian defense entities and to pursue 
alternate avenues for military UAV requirements for domestic use, 
including by developing Tajikistan's nascent capability to perform 
aerial surveillance on the Tajik-Afghan border. The United States is 
Tajikistan's partner of choice for security cooperation on the Tajik-
Afghan border. However, competitors such as Iran and the PRC may seek 
to fill the void if the United States were to opt out or is slow to 
respond to requests for assistance to help Tajikistan develop this 
critical surveillance capability.

    Question. If the Iranian drone factory is built and Tajik-produced 
drones were to be utilized as Russia runs out of equipment, how would 
you recommend Washington respond in Dushanbe?

    Answer. It is my understanding that Tajikistan has provided 
assurances at various levels that it has no intentions to export any 
drones that might be manufactured in Tajikistan in the future. If 
Tajikistan were to supply drones for Russia, I would advocate, if 
confirmed, for consideration of all tools available to impose costs on 
actors involved in such transfers.

    Question. Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has had a 
diminished influence in Central Asia as it focuses its diplomatic 
efforts elsewhere. This has opened a window of opportunity for 
increased U.S. involvement in Tajikistan.

   In what ways can the United States best take advantage of this 
        opportunity and lay down the foundation for permanent progress 
        in the U.S.-Tajikistan relationship?

    Answer. Russia's war has raised concerns across the region about 
its reliability as a security partner. Tajikistan appreciates the 
foremost U.S. objective in Tajikistan is ensuring the country's 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. If confirmed, I 
will seek to expand our security cooperation to advance shared 
interests in countering terrorism and securing the border. The Tajiks 
recognize their future depends on diversifying economic relationships 
away from Russia. We can support this effort by increasing bilateral 
economic relations and promoting ties with Tajikistan's Central Asian 
neighbors. Our Economic Resilience Initiative seeks to build regional 
trade and bolster opportunities to engage with the United States and 
globally.

    Question. Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has had a 
diminished influence in Central Asia as it focuses its diplomatic 
efforts elsewhere. This has opened a window of opportunity for 
increased U.S. involvement in Tajikistan.

   How will you work with Tajikistan's Government and private sector 
        to increase economic ties with the United States?

    Answer. Strengthening economic connections between the United 
States and Tajikistan will be an important priority for me if 
confirmed. Tajikistan's economy has major issues with corruption and 
lack of transparency that will need to be addressed to attract U.S. 
business. The banking industry's close links to Russia's banking system 
is a further obstacle. If confirmed, I will encourage Tajikistan to 
address corruption and transparency issues; I will work with like-
minded partners to modernize and expand Tajikistan's banks and 
businesses' ties to the global financial system, and I will continue to 
work with Tajikistan's business community to expand markets and create 
business opportunities for American companies that will support U.S. 
domestic job creation.

    Question. Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has had a 
diminished influence in Central Asia as it focuses its diplomatic 
efforts elsewhere. This has opened a window of opportunity for 
increased U.S. involvement in Tajikistan.

   As Ambassador, how will you work to build people-to-people ties 
        between the U.S. and Tajikistan, particularly to counter 
        Russian influence?

    Answer. U.S.-Tajik people-to-people ties are at the center of our 
30-year bilateral relationship. If confirmed, I look forward to 
expanding U.S.-Tajikistan ties and continuing to prioritize people-to-
people engagements. Our eight American Corners throughout the country, 
visited by thousands of people per year, offer programs to deepen 
understanding of our policy priorities and share educational resources 
and information on U.S. studies and cultural exchange programs. I also 
look forward, if confirmed, to expanding English-language programming 
in Tajikistan to help audiences access alternatives to Russian state 
media. I will also deepen USAID work in agriculture, public health, 
municipal water supply, and education.

    Question. There have been multiple cases of censorship, political 
persecution, and violence against journalists, including RFE/RL 
employees and affiliates in Tajikistan.

   If you are confirmed as U.S. Ambassador, what will you do to 
        support the work of RFE/RL and ensure open access for 
        Congressionally-funded international journalists at your new 
        post?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to continuing our efforts in this 
critical space. I will underscore to Tajik officials the importance of 
media freedom and speak out against the Government's ongoing crackdown 
on bloggers, journalists, and their families. I will actively engage 
with local and international media, providing access and transparency 
about the important work we do in Tajikistan. We will continue to 
advocate for a free press and engage proactively with the Tajik 
Government in support of RFE/RL and other independent media.

    Question. There have been multiple cases of censorship, political 
persecution, and violence against journalists, including RFE/RL 
employees and affiliates in Tajikistan.

   How will you engage with the Government of Tajikistan and encourage 
        them to respect the rights of journalists?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will call out threats to freedom of the 
press publicly and with Tajik interlocutors, in accordance with the 
values we share with the Tajik people and our support for human rights. 
We are proud of our longstanding support for journalists in Tajikistan, 
and I will continue our work to empower independent voices and to 
advocate on their behalf. The United States has facilitated regular 
dialogue between government and journalists, ensuring journalists know 
their legal rights. Now more than ever it is important for the Tajik 
people to have access to accurate, transparent information. If 
confirmed, I will remind the Tajik Government of its commitments and 
emphasize that freedom of expression is in Tajikistan's national 
interests in continuing to develop as a stable, prosperous, and 
sovereign nation.

    Question. How do you plan on leading the fight against corruption 
in Tajikistan from the U.S. Embassy?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will publicly and privately raise the 
importance of rule of law and anti-corruption efforts to the prosperity 
and independence of Tajikistan. I will also seek to ensure USAID and 
INL continue to prioritize assistance programming that effectively 
advances rule of law and anticorruption efforts, including efforts to 
increase transparency in customs regulation enforcement, energy 
payments and distribution, and health services.

    Question. What can the United States do to support anti-corruption 
efforts and democratic reforms in Tajikistan?

    Answer. Freedom of expression and media are essential in fostering 
transparency of government and combatting corruption. Throughout my 
career, I have witnessed firsthand how promoting media freedom can have 
a democratizing effect on countries. If confirmed, I will work with 
civil society to defend opportunities for free speech, and I will have 
frank conversations with the Government of Tajikistan to underscore 
that freedom of the press, combatting corruption, increasing 
transparency, and improving good governance enhance domestic stability 
and security.

    Question. How will you encourage Tajikistan's Government to ensure 
its economy is not used for sanctions evasion?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will underscore to Tajik authorities the 
importance of strengthening international sanctions and export controls 
introduced in response to Russia's war against Ukraine and the serious 
consequences of sanctions evasion. Recognizing that this is a 
collaborative effort, I will also ensure that the U.S. interagency 
works with our Tajik partners in the Government and private sector to 
explain existing sanctions and offers guidance on how to avoid 
inadvertent violations.

    Question. What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission 
Dushanbe?

    Answer. My understanding is that morale at Embassy Dushanbe is 
high. If confirmed I will seek to sustain a cohesive environment by 
promoting an organizational culture of mutual respect and 
collaboration. I am committed to attracting strong candidates and, in 
cases where morale issues arise, managing those situations effectively 
to prevent broader impacts on the Mission.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Dushanbe?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will foster a professional, inclusive, and 
respectful culture. the Embassy has made excellent efforts to support 
diversity and inclusion, and I intend to build on inclusive and 
transparent recruiting for both American and Local Staff positions. To 
address workspace and residential challenges resulting from years of 
Mission growth, I will proceed as expeditiously as possible with 
facilities upgrade projects. After years of negotiations, the 
Department recently received approval for a Build-to-Lease residential 
compound that will provide seismically safe housing. I also will 
bolster efforts to expand recreational facilities to promote wellness 
and attract qualified talent.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Dushanbe?

    Answer. I am a strong believer in a one-team, one-mission approach, 
and I have consistently implemented this principle as Deputy Chief of 
Mission and Charge d'Affaires, a.i., over the past six years. If 
confirmed, I will communicate the President's foreign policy, the 
Secretary's vision, and my strategic outlook to all members of our 
mission through a range of formal and informal platforms, including 
Country Team meetings, townhalls, and one-on-one discussions. I will 
proactively seek all Mission member views, drawing from diverse 
perspectives and experiences to shape consensus. Most importantly, I 
will champion an organizational culture based on mutual respect and 
collaboration to build morale and effectively execute policies and 
programs.

    Question. How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. My leadership style is inclusive. I seek consensus and buy-
in in managing and leading change. I strive to lead with strategic 
vision while empowering my staff to execute policy and programming. I 
avoid micromanagement, as I firmly believe this is an ineffective 
approach that runs counter to strategic, visionary leadership and 
undermines team morale. I am always open to constructive and 
appropriate dissent, supporting innovation and appropriate risk-taking.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. It is never acceptable to berate subordinates or 
colleagues. Secretary Blinken has been clear on his expectations of 
Chiefs of Mission and all employees on maintaining a workplace culture 
of mutual respect. I fully support the Secretary's directive and 
Department policy on workplace conduct.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. As a two-time DCM, I recognize this partnership, and a 
collaborative relationship between the Chief of Mission and her or his 
Deputy, are critical to any Mission's success. As an MBA and with my 
in-service private sector experience through the Eagleburger 
fellowship, I often cite the ``Ambassador as CEO, DCM as COO'' model as 
an effective approach. I will ask my DCM to provide me frank and candid 
management, operational, and policy advice--including dissenting views 
and recommendations. Only through this collaborative, inclusive 
approach can we best benefit from the diversity of experiences and 
different skillsets that my DCM brings to our Mission.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will ask her to lead on mentoring and 
development of entry-level and first- and second-tour Officers and 
Specialists. I will also ask her to coordinate working-level security 
matters, chairing the Emergency Action Committee to effectively support 
my own primary leadership responsibility in this area. In addition, I 
will ask her to lead on strategic policy formulation, particularly 
related to regional issues (countering PRC and Russian influence and 
disinformation, Iran, Afghanistan) and formulating recommendations to 
me on assistance and public diplomacy programming.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Yes. This is a mandatory responsibility of all supervisors 
under longstanding Department policy and one that I take very 
seriously. In previous leadership positions, including most recently as 
DCM in two posts, I have taken an engaged, active role in providing 
constructive feedback, mentoring of employees, and leading 
informational training sessions on the EER process, drawing from my own 
experiences, including prior service on a Foreign Service Selection 
Board.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes. Clear, accurate, direct, and timely feedback is 
critical to helping all our employees succeed and realize their 
potential, which in turn will underpin our success as a Mission. In 
addition, feedback, including mentoring and active coaching, is key to 
rewarding high achievers and preparing them for the future leadership 
roles we will need them to assume in an increasingly challenging, 
complex world.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Tajikistan. In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our 
Embassy walls enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. I am firmly committed to engaging in robust public 
diplomacy. It is my understanding that U.S. diplomats in Tajikistan 
have been able to meet with an array of individuals from Tajik society 
across the country--from individuals serving in government, education, 
energy, security, and foreign missions. As an example, the Public 
Diplomacy Section implements English-language programs for civil 
servants, teachers, refugees, and journalists--all of whom develop 
language fluency and continue to build a bridge as U.S. diplomats go 
out to support the work of these audiences and communities in 
Tajikistan. The Embassy also maintains a network of eight American 
Spaces throughout the country to extend the reach of U.S. programs.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would work to ensure that our Embassy team 
continues to build and expand its contacts with the people of 
Tajikistan. I would encourage our diplomats to use their language 
skills to interact with the broadest possible cross-section of society 
and to travel extensively throughout the country. From my experience, I 
believe direct, people-to-people contact is the most effective and 
impactful in terms of promoting U.S. values and understanding local 
perspectives. At the same time, I will continue to support efforts to 
leverage new media and high-technology as a force multiplier to expand 
our outreach and amplify our messaging across Tajikistan.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in 
Tajikistan?

    Answer. We have a wide-ranging series of Public Diplomacy (PD) 
programs in Tajikistan. Cultural heritage preservation work continues 
to be an area of cooperation. Additionally, the network of American 
Spaces remains a popular educational resource. Over the last year, 
Dushanbe PD has positioned itself as a hub for regional cooperation by 
successfully integrating local Tajiks, Afghan refugees, and fellow 
Central Asian neighbors into a network of motivated youth looking to 
improve their future. If confirmed, I will ensure PD programming is a 
key part of our efforts to build trust and understanding between the 
United States and Tajik people.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. Public Diplomacy practitioners in Tajikistan face a 
challenging information environment. Internet penetration is low, and 
Russian, Iranian, and PRC disinformation is rampant. Our team dedicates 
significant time to empowering local partners to counter false 
narratives and disseminate fact-based messaging. Additionally, slow 
responses and bureaucratic hurdles from the Government of Tajikistan 
continue to challenge our public diplomacy efforts.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country Mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. In general, we defer to officers and local staff in-country 
who are experts on the local media environment and can tailor our 
messaging for Tajik audiences. In fact, one of our local staff members 
was this year's runner up for a Department-wide award for local staff 
employee of the year for her efforts to advance public outreach 
programming. Main State and the Public Diplomacy Section maintain 
constant communication and work together on mutually reinforcing public 
messaging with the goal of advancing support for U.S. policy 
effectively among local audiences.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes. I am deeply troubled by potential anomalous health 
incidents that have affected U.S. Government personnel and their family 
members. Serving one's country overseas should not come at the cost of 
one's health. I agree that such incidents may pose a threat to the 
wellbeing of U.S. personnel and must be taken extremely seriously. If 
confirmed, the health, safety, and security of Embassy staff, their 
family members, and all those supporting the Mission will be my highest 
priority.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel. The past occurrences and ongoing threat of anomalous 
health incidents among Embassy personnel and their families poses a 
serious challenge to morale. When personnel at post fear for their 
safety or doubt that their case will be taken seriously if they were 
affected, the performance of Embassy operations can suffer.

   If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you can to 
        Mission Dushanbe personnel?

    Answer. If confirmed, I am committed to share regularly new 
information on this issue, consistent with ensuring the integrity of 
ongoing investigations.

    Question. In the 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report, Tajikistan 
remained on Tier 2 for its implementation of a national action plan but 
failing to convict any traffickers, among other key issues. How will 
you work with the host government and civil society actors to address 
these issues if you are confirmed as Ambassador?

    Answer. Tajikistan's Government has demonstrated sustained 
political will and openness to closer cooperation with the U.S. 
Government and other international partners to counter trafficking in 
persons (TIP), but it faces significant challenges in terms of weak 
institutional capacity and underlying economic factors that drive TIP 
trends. If I am confirmed, I will engage with the Government of 
Tajikistan, in particular the Prosecutor General's Office, to help it 
more actively pursue cases against traffickers, protect victims, and 
implement the country's TIP National Action Plan, including the 
adoption of standard operating procedures for victim identification and 
referral to services.

    Question. Do you commit to reporting accurate information as it 
pertains to the reality of the trafficking situation in Tajikistan?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the Government of 
Tajikistan, civil society, and international organizations to obtain 
accurate and up-to-date information regarding the human trafficking 
situation in Tajikistan. I will ensure reporting of accurate 
information as it pertains to the reality of trafficking in Tajikistan.

    Question. In the 2021 International Religious Freedom report, 
Tajikistan's dismal record on religious freedom very clearly is in 
peril of declining further. The report outlines repressive policies on 
public religious events or displays, bans on religious wear, and 
increasing numbers of religious prisoners of conscience. What is your 
assessment of this particular issue and if confirmed, how will you work 
with the office of the Ambassador-at-Large for international religious 
freedom to bolster religious freedom in-country?

    Answer. I am deeply concerned about the status of religious freedom 
in Tajikistan. Since 2016, Tajikistan has been designated a Country of 
Particular Concern for engaging in or tolerating particularly severe 
violations of religious freedom. Authorities have detained and, in some 
cases tortured, members of religious groups based on allegations of 
``religious extremism.'' The Government bans those under age eighteen 
from public religious events, the only national government in the world 
to do so. Ambassador Hussain regularly engages with the Tajik 
Government to raise religious freedom concerns, and if confirmed, I 
look forward to working with Ambassador Hussain to promote religious 
freedom in Tajikistan and the region.

    Question. In the 2021 Human Rights Report, Tajikistan had numerous 
significant human rights abuses including torture and abuse of 
detainees, arbitrary detention, forced disappearance, censorship, 
threats against journalists, and more. If confirmed, what steps will 
you take to address these instances with the host government?

    Answer. Unfortunately, since the publication of the 2021 Human 
Rights Report, the human rights situation in Tajikistan has worsened, 
especially since the Government's crackdown on May protests in the 
Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous region. If confirmed, I will raise human 
rights at the highest levels of the Tajik Government, promote 
programming that supports civil society and media freedom, and press 
the Government to provide answers on cases of arbitrary and 
politically-motivated detention. I will advocate for an end to torture 
and other abuses, and for the release of political prisoners. I will 
convey that human rights concerns are an impediment to closer bilateral 
relations and that we stand ready to provide assistance to foster 
progress.

    Question. How will you direct your Embassy to work with civil 
society organizations to improve the human rights situation on the 
ground?

    Answer. Civil society's contributions are essential to ensuring the 
people of Tajikistan can exercise their fundamental freedoms. If 
confirmed, I will continue to invest in improving media literacy, 
journalist training, and countering misinformation, all essential to 
building and sustaining a robust civil society. I will ensure our 
Embassy routinely engages with key groups, especially those involved in 
freedom of expression and representing marginalized groups, and that 
our team hears civil society voices within Tajikistan, and well as 
those outside the country. An informed and engaged civil society in 
Tajikistan will be critical to our broader efforts to counter 
authoritarian pressure an undemocratic models from Russia and China, 
and I commit to prioritizing these efforts.



                               __________


            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
         Submitted to Manuel P. Micaller by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. As we speak, the Party is 
cracking down on unprecedented student protests across the country. 
With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry, the CCP 
could stop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. As Secretary Blinken has noted, the ruling Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP) is the most serious long-term challenge to the 
international order. Beijing's coercive tactics are deeply 
destabilizing and threaten U.S. interests across the globe. PRC 
authorities have committed genocide and crimes against humanity against 
Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in 
Xinjiang. Secretary Blinken has made clear that the United States 
stands with countries and people around the world in condemning the 
atrocities happening in Xinjiang, and if confirmed, I will encourage 
Tajikistan to promote accountability for the PRC's atrocities against 
Uyghurs and members of other religious and ethnic minority groups.

    Question. Does the CCP undertake any activities that are beneficial 
to U.S. interests?

    Answer. In Tajikistan, the PRC has expanded security cooperation 
with the Tajik Ministry of Internal Affairs under the auspices of 
contributing to border security in the Tri-Border region between 
Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and the PRC. However, the effect this 
cooperation will have on regional security is unclear. The United 
States is currently Tajikistan's partner of choice in securing its 
border with Afghanistan, and our cooperation is a significant factor in 
moving Tajikistan away from partnerships with the PRC and other 
problematic neighbors.

    Question. Do you believe there are any areas within which the CCP 
would constructively work with the United States in good faith?

    Answer. The way the U.S. and the PRC manage our relationship in the 
coming years will have significant consequences for the entire world. 
That is why competition with Beijing will not preclude cooperation in 
areas where our interests intersect. In Tajikistan, we continue to 
explore options where the interests of the United States and the PRC 
align. This includes areas such as public health, counterterrorism, 
counternarcotics, food security, and the environment.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China in 
Tajikistan?

    Answer. The United States does not currently have any joint 
activities with organizations or representatives from the PRC in 
Tajikistan. If confirmed, I would explore the possibility of diplomatic 
engagement with the PRC Embassy in Dushanbe on issues where our 
interests align.

    Question. Since the U.S. left Afghanistan, many countries in the 
region find themselves at renewed risk of Taliban-sponsored terrorism. 
Much of the anti-Taliban resistance in Afghanistan is composed of 
ethnic Tajiks, while several Afghan Air Force pilots flew American 
provided planes and helicopters to Tajikistan in the wake of the 
Taliban takeover. We are now seeing signs that China is expanding its 
presence in the region to fill the void left by the U.S.

   How do you assess that China's presence in Tajikistan will evolve 
        in light of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan?

    Answer. The PRC has a strong economic presence in Tajikistan and is 
by far Tajikistan's largest foreign investor, with PRC loans accounting 
for more than 30 percent of Tajikistan's external debt. The PRC may 
seek to take advantage of both border insecurity caused by the Taliban 
takeover of Afghanistan and Russia's diminished security cooperation 
with Tajikistan, to expand its own security presence in Tajikistan. In 
October 2021, the PRC agreed to build a base for Tajik Ministry of 
Internal Affairs officers in the tri-border region. Tajikistan offered 
the PRC full ownership of an existing joint Tajik-PRC base in 
Tajikistan's Gorno-Badakhshon. Both facilities are near the Kulma 
border crossing point between Tajikistan and the PRC. If confirmed, I 
will continue to build on our longstanding history as a trusted 
security partner to Tajikistan, underscoring the greater quality, 
efficacy, and transparency of U.S. training and equipment programs.

    Question. Does Russia's war against Ukraine have implications for 
the Chinese presence in Tajikistan?

    Answer. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised concerns regarding 
Russia's intentions and reliability as a partner for Tajikistan. The 
PRC may seek to exploit Russia's currently limited bandwidth in 
Tajikistan to strengthen or expand its own position and influence.

    Question. If confirmed, what will you do to ensure the return of 
American equipment in Tajikistan?

    Answer. Since the former Afghanistan Air Force and Special Mission 
Wing aircraft and associated equipment first arrived in Tajikistan, the 
Government of Tajikistan has honored USG ownership of the equipment and 
formally requested transfer in support of emergent border security and 
counterterrorism concerns following the withdrawal of U.S. forces from 
Afghanistan. We are working through the formal security cooperation 
process to determine which aircraft will support both Tajikistan's 
requirements and our own national security interests in the region.

    Question. How would you describe Tajikistan's approach to the 
Taliban and to anti-Taliban Afghan groups?

    Answer. Tajikistan is an outlier in Central Asia in its stance on 
Afghanistan, as it remains resolute in its unwillingness to recognize 
the interim Taliban Government and open to supporting the Afghan 
National Resistance Front. President Rahmon has repeatedly condemned 
the persecution of minorities and urged establishment of an inclusive 
Afghan Government that represents ethnic Tajiks and other minority 
groups. As early as August 25, 2021, President Rahmon announced 
Tajikistan would not recognize a government ``formed through 
oppression,'' and Dushanbe has not wavered on this stance despite 
pressure from the PRC, Pakistan, and Russia.

    Question. What role, if any, should the United States play in 
backing Tajikistan's support of anti-Taliban Afghan groups?

    Answer. The United States maintains an active dialogue with the 
Government of Tajikistan on regional security interests of mutual 
concern, including Afghanistan. In August 2021, Tajikistan was 
instrumental in helping ensure the safety and security of U.S. persons 
who sought to cross the border. If confirmed, I commit to continue our 
robust dialogue with Tajik interlocutors on mutual concerns vis-a-vis 
Afghanistan.

         Submitted to Manuel P. Micaller by Senator Todd Young

    Question. What implications does Russia's war against Ukraine have 
for Tajikistan's economy?

    Answer. Russia's war against Ukraine has significant implications 
for Tajikistan's economy. At least one million Tajiks live in Russia as 
labor migrants; their remittances comprise approximately 30 percent 
equivalent of Tajikistan's GDP. Tajikistan's top trading partner is 
Russia. Tajikistan's economy is vulnerable to sanctions applied on 
Russia and reduced remittance inflows. In March, the World Food Program 
projected that Russia's war in Ukraine could cause an anticipated 
eightfold increase in severely food insecure individuals in Tajikistan 
by the fall of 2022. Tajikistan imports 60 percent of its food, and the 
price of flour, largely imported from Kazakhstan, has risen more than 
20 percent since February.

    Question. How can Tajikistan decrease its economic dependence on 
Russia? And if confirmed, how would you effectively support those 
efforts?

    Answer. Tajikistan can decrease its economic dependence on Russia 
by expanding trade with other Central Asian countries, disconnecting 
its banks and businesses from Russia, and reducing corruption in its 
economy to attract foreign direct investment. If confirmed, I will 
support Tajikistan's efforts to decouple its economy from Russia by 
fostering intraregional economic connectivity through programs such as 
the Economic Resilience Initiative for Central Asia via the C5+1 
(Central Asian countries, plus the United States). I will also work 
with likeminded partners to expand Tajikistan's banking and business 
ties with the global financial system.
    Question. How do you assess that China's presence in Tajikistan is 
evolving, especially as it moves to secure primacy in supply chains and 
trade?

    Answer. The PRC has a strong economic presence in Tajikistan and is 
by far Tajikistan's largest foreign investor, with PRC loans accounting 
for more than 30 percent of Tajikistan's external debt. The PRC may 
seek to take advantage of border insecurity caused by the Taliban 
takeover of Afghanistan and Russia's waning security cooperation with 
Tajikistan, expanding its own security presence in Tajikistan. In 
October 2021, the PRC agreed to build a base for Tajik Ministry of 
Internal Affairs officers in the tri-border region. Tajikistan offered 
the PRC full ownership of an existing joint Tajik-PRC base in 
Tajikistan's Gorno-Badakhshon. Both facilities are near the Kulma 
border crossing point between Tajikistan and the PRC.

                              ----------                              


                      WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 2022

                                       U.S. SENATE,
                            Committee on Foreign Relations,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:37 p.m., in 
Room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Robert 
Menendez presiding.
    Present: Senators Menendez [presiding], Shaheen, Murphy, 
Kaine, Merkley, Schatz, Van Hollen, Risch, Romney, Portman, 
Young, and Barrasso.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ,
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY

    The Chairman. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will 
come to order.
    Today, we will consider five nominations that are critical 
to United States foreign policy.
    Ambassador Lynne Tracy nominated to be the Ambassador to 
Russia is on the first panel.
    The second panel will be Ambassador Julie Fisher to be the 
Ambassador to Cyprus, Ms. Kristina Kvien to be the Ambassador 
to Armenia, Ms. Carol Spahn to be the director of the Peace 
Corps, and Ms. Cynthia Dyer to be the director of the Office to 
Monitor and Combat Trafficking.
    Before we proceed, I understand that Senator Portman is 
going to be introducing Ambassador Tracy.
    Senator Portman, you are recognized.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. ROB PORTMAN,
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM OHIO

    Senator Portman. Great. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    It is my honor to be here to introduce a fellow Ohioan, 
Ambassador Lynne Tracy, to be the nominee for Russia. She was 
born and raised in Barberton, Ohio, to Albert and Carol Sue 
Tracy, both Ohio natives. Her sister, from Barberton, is behind 
us.
    She graduated from Barberton High School where she played 
volleyball, was a great student. And then she branched out and 
decided to go south to University of Georgia where she majored 
in Soviet studies.
    After graduating, she put her studies to the test, working 
as a contractor at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for three years 
in the late 1980s. Of course, that was when it was still the 
Soviet Union so it was a challenging time.
    But not even the joyful winters of USSR could keep her away 
from home. Ohio called her and she returned to attend law 
school at the University of Akron.
    Shortly thereafter, Ambassador Tracy entered her nation's 
call and she joined the Foreign Service. Her career sense has 
been impressive and prepares her well, I believe, for the role 
she is seeking.
    She has been all across post-Soviet space including some 
very difficult postings. She has worked our diplomatic missions 
in Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Embassy Moscow, 
where she served as the DCM--Deputy Chief of Mission--from 2014 
to 2017.
    She has also served several assignments here in Washington 
D.C., including in the European and Eurasian Affairs Bureau at 
State Department and on the National Security Council.
    Her career has taken her to Pakistan twice and even to 
Afghanistan soon after 9/11 when the country was still a very 
active war zone. This position will be Ambassador Tracy's 
second ambassadorship as she is currently U.S. Ambassador to 
Armenia where she has been since 2019.
    I do not have to tell anybody on this panel that Armenia 
and the Caucuses have been an interesting place to be during 
that period of time, very challenging, and she served there 
with distinction.
    Her long Foreign Service career in the post-Soviet space, 
her current experience as chief of mission, even her college 
major in Soviet studies, and, of course, her solid, Midwestern 
upbringing in Ohio--all of these things have prepared her well 
for this very difficult role.
    Needless to say, our relationship with Russia is strained 
and a challenging one to manage. We should not confirm anyone 
as U.S. Ambassador to Russia who is untested or unqualified.
    Ambassador Tracy is neither of those. She is tested, she is 
eminently qualified, and I am pleased to introduce her today 
and look forward to hearing from her.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Portman, and always good 
to have one of our distinguished colleagues on the committee be 
introducing a nominee.
    Let me congratulate all of the nominees. We thank you for 
your service to our country, your willingness to serve. We 
thank you for and your families as well. I know they will have 
to make sacrifices as you serve in your posts.
    This is especially true in Russia. Our diplomatic presence 
in Moscow, our dialogue with Putin's government, have shrunk 
dramatically in the wake of his illegal and barbaric invasion 
of Ukraine.
    Putin's war against Ukrainian civilians is targeting their 
electricity and their water and abducting their children. It is 
unlike anything Europe has seen since the Second World War.
    And, yet, even as Putin continues to carry out this brutal 
war, we need an ambassador who can represent us there.
    You, Ambassador, will not only have to carry out your 
duties in the face of a hostile government but you will also 
represent America beyond the Kremlin walls to the broad mass of 
the Russian people, many of whom feel isolated and betrayed by 
their leader's war of aggression, to the detainees of this war, 
to the Russian opposition activists who are fighting for a 
different way forward in Russia, and to the Ukrainians who will 
look to you for assessments of our relationship with Moscow.
    It is difficult to imagine a more challenging assignment 
for a career diplomat. So I look forward to hearing from you 
how to plan--how you plan to tackle these and other issues upon 
your confirmation.
    With that, I will turn to Ranking Member Risch for his 
remarks.

               STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES E. RISCH,
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM IDAHO

    Senator Risch. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Good morning, and welcome to Ambassador Tracy. Ambassador 
Tracy has been nominated to be Ambassador to Russia at the 
lowest point of relations between our two countries since the 
Cold War. Our soldiers are not on the field facing each other 
but our weapons do combat back and forth every day.
    Putin continues his unjust, unprovoked, and inhumane war on 
Ukraine, which includes deliberate attacks on civilian critical 
infrastructure as well as atrocities perpetrated against the 
civilian population.
    He continues to weaponize Russian energy supplies against 
U.S. allies and partners in Europe and uses the profits to fund 
his war in Ukraine.
    Under Putin, Russia has reemerged as a strategic challenger 
to the United States and the entire transatlantic community. 
The withdrawal of Russia from bilateral arms control measures 
further highlights the dangerous game of brinksmanship they 
always play.
    Russia continues to be a very dangerous place for 
Americans. There are a number of Americans held in Russia 
today, two of whom have been designated as wrongfully detained 
under the Levinson Act.
    It is clear these people are targeted to be used as 
political bargaining chips. The Kremlin has long been suspected 
of using its personnel in the U.S. or assigned to Russian 
consulates, the Russian Embassy, and the Russian mission to the 
U.N. to conduct espionage and malign influence activities 
against the United States.
    Meanwhile, over the past eight years, the U.S. has been 
forced to close three of its consulates in Russia while Russia 
continues to operate its consulates in Houston and New York.
    In addition, our State Department continues to grant more 
diplomatic visas to Russia than Russia grants to the United 
States.
    We must build on recent though tenuous progress in 
countering these efforts, which began during the Trump 
administration and not giving in to Russian pressure tactics.
    Short staffing at Embassy Moscow has seriously hindered 
facilities management and the day-to-day conduct of American 
diplomacy and I commend our diplomats in Moscow for continuing 
to keep our embassy operational in spite of these challenges.
    While I wish to see these restrictions eased, I also expect 
the department to prioritize visa reciprocity in any 
conversations about increasing our footprint in country.
    We cannot allow the Kremlin to hold our diplomatic 
facilities and personnel hostage in an attempt to secure policy 
concessions or an increased diplomatic or intelligence presence 
in the U.S.
    From managing the lines of diplomatic effort and dialogue 
to pursuing consular access for Americans held in Russia to 
simply keeping the building and team running, Ambassador Tracy 
will face many challenges, if confirmed.
    Ambassador Tracy, I thank you for your years of service and 
for stepping up to this, what is going to be a very difficult 
task, undoubtedly. I look forward to hearing your plans to 
confront these issues.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Risch. So we will turn to 
Ambassador Tracy. Your full statement will be included in the 
record.
    We would ask you to summarize it in about five minutes or 
so so that the members of the committee can have a conversation 
with you.
    And you are recognized.

 STATEMENT OF HON. LYNNE M. TRACY OF OHIO, A CAREER MEMBER OF 
THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF CAREER MINISTER, NOMINATED 
   TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE 
       UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION

    Ms. Tracy. Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Risch, members 
of the committee, thank you, Senator Portman, for the very kind 
introduction.
    I also want to thank you for your service to the state of 
Ohio, the Senate, and to this committee. Your leadership and 
commitment to public service is inspirational, particularly 
with the national challenges--national security challenges 
facing our country.
    I am honored to appear before you today as President 
Biden's nominee to be the next ambassador of the United States 
to the Russian Federation and I am grateful to President Biden 
and Secretary Blinken for the confidence they have placed in me 
during a period of unprecedented tension in U.S.-Russia 
relations brought about by Russia's war on Ukraine.
    For 28 years, I have had the good fortune to represent the 
United States as a Foreign Service Officer. Many of those 
assignments have been in countries--in the countries of the 
former Soviet Union.
    It has been a privilege to serve as U.S. Ambassador to 
Armenia and prior to that as Deputy Chief of Mission in Moscow. 
My experience as a contractor in the late 1980s at the embassy 
in Moscow as part of an American-only staff is an experience 
that has again become relevant to some of the challenges we are 
facing today.
    Throughout my career, I have worked hard to protect our 
nation and its interests. For me, this has always been about 
more than the effort of one individual. It has required 
teamwork that goes beyond a single department or just one 
branch of our government.
    If confirmed, I pledge to continue that team approach and 
to work closely with the members and staff of this committee on 
our Russia policy.
    Mr. Chairman, this committee and other members of Congress 
have my commitment that, if confirmed, the plight of U.S. 
citizens detained in Russia will be a top priority for me.
    U.S. citizens living and traveling in Russia have faced 
unprecedented harassment and some have been determined by the 
Secretary of State to be wrongfully detained.
    With the support of the consular team in Moscow, I will 
devote my attention and energy to supporting the welfare and 
well being of every U.S. citizen detained in Russia.
    I will work closely with Washington as the Administration 
continues to engage Russian authorities to bring Paul Whelan 
and Brittney Griner home. I will also pursue the humanitarian 
release of Marc Fogel.
    I will press the Russian Government to live up to its 
obligations, including as they relate to providing timely and 
consistent consular access and to the fair treatment of our 
citizens who are detained.
    As the members of this committee know all too well, 
Russia's unjustified and unprovoked war against Ukraine has 
shattered European security and undermined global economic 
stability.
    Russia's war has resulted in catastrophic loss of life and 
in recent days, as it struggles on the battlefield, the Putin 
regime has escalated its attacks with a bombing campaign 
against civilian infrastructure intended to cause suffering and 
death for ordinary Ukrainians.
    Together, with our allies and partners, the United States 
remains committed to supporting Ukraine's sovereignty, 
independence, and territorial integrity and to helping Ukraine 
defend itself.
    We are also imposing unprecedented economic costs on Russia 
and welcome the continued close coordination with Congress on 
sanctions and other tools.
    As the world's two preeminent nuclear powers, the United 
States and Russia have special responsibilities. These include 
refraining from reckless saber rattling, maintaining lines of 
communication to reduce nuclear risks, and living up to the 
commitments under the New START treaty and other arms control 
obligations.
    President Biden has said the Administration is ready to 
negotiate a new arms control framework to replace New START 
when it expires in 2026. But we need Russia to allow for 
inspections to resume under the treaty before we can have a 
dialogue on what comes next.
    The Russian Government is intensifying repression against 
civil society, independent media, human rights activists, pro-
democracy activists, advocates, and even Russian citizens who 
simply have the courage to use the word war.
    If confirmed, I will work to keep a spotlight of support on 
those like Vladimir Kara-Murza, Alexei Navalny, and Radio Free 
Europe reporter Vladislav Yesypenko, who have been jailed or 
harassed simply for seeking to exercise their fundamental 
freedoms.
    I believe that promoting mutual understanding among 
Americans and Russians can contribute to long-term stability in 
our bilateral relations. Even in the darkest days of the Soviet 
Union citizens of goodwill in both our countries formed people-
to-people ties.
    I will cultivate those connections, particularly through 
our public diplomacy programs, in order to keep the door open 
to a better future.
    If confirmed, I will reach out to the Russian people at all 
levels of society as one of my priorities. These topics and 
others require hard conversations and, if confirmed, I will 
make it a priority to conduct frank diplomacy, supporting the 
President's efforts to maintain a clear channel of 
communication and to hold Russia accountable.
    We have a team of smart, experienced, and dedicated public 
servants at our embassy in Moscow who are performing 
brilliantly in an extremely challenging environment. Their 
safety, security, and ability to do their jobs is of paramount 
concern.
    If confirmed, it will be one of the greatest honors and 
privileges of my career to lead them and I pledge to do so with 
integrity and humility.
    Finally, I am pleased to be joined today by my sister, 
Anita Jepsky. I have been blessed to receive the indispensable 
support of my family. My parents, Albert and Carol Sue Tracy, 
Anita, and my sister, Mary Lou Tracy, have always believed in 
me and been there for me.
    I am grateful to Ambassador John Sullivan and my mentor, 
Ambassador John Tefft, for their wise counsel and strong 
example of public service. I also want to acknowledge my 
history professor at the University of Georgia, Dr. Ronald 
Rader, and his wife, Zhanna Rader, who guided my first steps as 
a student pursuing a deeper understanding of Russia and the 
Soviet Union.
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, thank you for the privilege 
of appearing before the committee today and considering my 
nomination. I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Tracy follows:]

Soviet Union.
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, thank you for the privilege of 
appearing before the committee and considering my nomination. I look 
forward to your questions.


    The Chairman. All right. Well, thank you.
    Before we start our five-minute rounds, there are questions 
that we ask all nominees and I just simply need a yes or no 
from you.
    It speaks to the importance this committee places on 
responsiveness by officials in the executive branch and that we 
expect and will be seeking from you.
    So do you agree to appear before this committee and make 
officials from your office available to the committee and 
designated staff when invited?
    Ms. Tracy. Yes.
    The Chairman. Do you commit to keep the committee fully and 
currently informed about the activities under your purview?
    Ms. Tracy. Yes.
    The Chairman. Do you commit to engaging in meaningful 
consultation while policies are being developed, not just 
providing notification after the fact?
    Ms. Tracy. Yes.
    The Chairman. And do you commit to promptly responding to 
requests for briefings and information requested by the 
committee and its designated staff?
    Ms. Tracy. Yes.
    The Chairman. All right. So our nominee has answered yes to 
all those questions so we will start a round of five minutes. I 
will recognize myself.
    It is obvious the importance of this nomination because 
while we have a whole series of nominees that will be 
testifying at a second panel we have had you exclusively before 
this panel, which--before the committee. So it speaks volumes 
about the importance that we think this particular position 
entails.
    And so I want to ask you, I know that you have been our 
Ambassador to Armenia. I know that you at one time were the 
Deputy Chief of Mission in Russia. But this is a very high 
profile and, I would say, tough job.
    Are you up to it?
    Ms. Tracy. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question. I 
believe that I am.
    Over the course of my 28 years in the Foreign Service I 
have been tested in a number of assignments, both in terms of 
some of the challenges of physical security during a tour in 
the Peshawar, Pakistan.
    My tour as Deputy Chief of Mission in Russia at the embassy 
in Moscow was already in a period after Russia's illegal 
annexation of Crimea when our relations were hurtling downward 
and we faced regular harassment of our staff.
    We--I personally experienced some of that where we were in 
the glare of ambushes from so-called journalists. So I have 
seen in Russia already some of what I expect will be a 
continuation of some of the same practices.
    And then let me say, finally, it has been a tremendous 
honor to be the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia in a period of 
enormous opportunity but of tremendous challenge, as I know you 
understand very well as someone who has followed the Caucasus 
very closely.
    During my tenure we were in a period of active conflict, a 
war that brought tremendous pressures on our embassy, on our 
staff, and that is another experience that I believe I will 
bring to bear in serving if confirmed as the U.S. Ambassador to 
the Russian Federation.
    Thank you.
    The Chairman. You refer to some of the difficulties of this 
particular assignment. The Russian Government has sought to 
make it difficult for the United States to operate diplomatic 
facilities in Russia. They forcibly terminated local employed 
staff, declared diplomats to be persona non grata.
    So we want to, first of all, take this opportunity to thank 
the personnel who have worked at our embassy in Russia over the 
years, both Americans and local staff, and particularly those 
currently serving during an incredibly trying and challenging 
time.
    How can the embassy's work be effective both in terms of 
providing service on behalf of Americans and in representing 
and advancing U.S. interests at a time that our diplomatic 
relations are barely existent?
    Ms. Tracy. Mr. Chairman, as you well know and the committee 
knows, we are operating at a greatly reduced staffing and, yet, 
everything that I have seen in my preparation for this hearing 
and for understanding our operations in Moscow speaks to the 
dedication, the capabilities, of our excellent team in Moscow 
of Americans able to carry out duties under extremely difficult 
circumstances.
    It is not easy, particularly in the kind of surveillance 
environment that we have in Russia. I mean, this was something 
that I saw when I was the Deputy Chief of Mission.
    It is almost impossible to go anywhere without some kind of 
surveillance, including when we were meeting journalists, 
political activists, academics, and it has gotten a lot harder 
even since then. People are afraid.
    But what has struck me as I have looked at some of the work 
that the embassy is doing is that Russians are still reaching 
out to us, interested in maintaining contact.
    We have still some very strong public diplomacy programs 
that are active, exchange programs that are allowing us to keep 
the door open to Russian citizens who are interested in a 
better kind of relationship and future.
    But it is difficult and we have to be careful because of 
the risks that people are taking when they are in touch with 
our embassy in these times.
    The Chairman. Two final sets of questions and let me try to 
synthesize them.
    I remain deeply concerned about Americans detained in 
Russia, including Paul Whelan, Brittney Griner, Marc Fogel, and 
James Wilgus, a New Jersey constituent.
    Do you commit to requesting regular consular access for all 
Americans detained in Russia to assure that their basic needs 
are being met?
    Ms. Tracy. Absolutely.
    The Chairman. Will you personally commit to visit 
wrongfully detained Americans Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner 
and supports us beyond working to secure their release?
    Ms. Tracy. Yes, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Russia continues to jail opposition leaders 
including Vladimir Kara-Murza, Alexei Navalny, Ilya Yashin, 
who, I believe, are true patriots of Russia who advocate for a 
better future for the Russian people.
    In September, Ranking Member Risch and I wrote the 
Administration requesting a determination under the Global 
Magnitsky Human Rights and Accountability Act as to whether the 
treatment of Mr. Kara-Murza is sanctionable under the Act and, 
if so, if the Administration plans to impose sanctions.
    So, assuming you are confirmed, do I have your commitment 
that you will work with the Administration to respond to our 
letter with a determination no later than January 20th of next 
year, which is the date required by law?
    Ms. Tracy. Yes, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Okay. I have other questions in this regard 
but I will submit them for the record in deference to my 
colleagues. Senator Risch went to vote and so I will recognize 
Senator Romney at this time.
    Senator Romney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I appreciate very much your willingness to serve in a 
hostile place, an often cold place. Moscow is not particularly 
beautiful, depending upon the corner of the city you happen to 
be in, and, of course, there are no McDonald's there anymore.
    So it is a challenging spot. The last piece, obviously, a 
bit of humor, the other quite serious, and I very much 
appreciate your service and that of the people who serve with 
you.
    I want to ask you a question just about Armenia, which is 
what is the perception of the people in Armenia with regards to 
Russia, with regards to Putin, with regards to the Ukrainian 
invasion?
    How do they see that and do you believe that is shared by 
other of the Soviet state--former Soviet states? But in 
particular with regards to Armenia what is the perspective 
there?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, thank you. You have asked an extremely 
timely and relevant question.
    What I have been seeing and hearing since Russia's invasion 
of Ukraine in February 24th is a sense of real concern among 
other former Soviet countries about the future of their 
independence and sovereignty and territorial integrity. They, I 
think, are each looking and wondering who is next.
    Unfortunately, there are also a number of dependencies 
among former Soviet states on Russia. We think the United 
States and Armenia and with the support of Congress has, 
thankfully, been able to work on reducing some of those 
dependencies and to be looking in a more westward direction.
    In 2018, the Armenian people held their freest and fairest 
elections since independence and underwent then in 2020 one of 
the greatest stress tests that a democracy can endure, which 
was a war, and in the following summer held, again, free and 
fair elections.
    And what Armenians have told me is because they do not want 
to go back, they do not want to go back to corrupt leaders, and 
they want to find a better future.
    Coming back to Russia, I think the problem--and this is 
what Armenians are saying--they see that some of their previous 
relationships or standing relationships that they have had with 
Russia are not meeting the needs of Armenia today.
    So I think where we are at right now between the United 
States and Armenia is having some very important conversations 
about how we can be helpful to Armenia as it continues, I 
think, seeking a more democratic future and a secure future.
    I will say that there are many security challenges there as 
well that Russia is playing a role in that we have to keep--pay 
attention to.
    Thank you.
    Senator Romney. Thank you.
    News reports suggest that many, many people left Russia 
escaping the potential to be drafted into their military 
service or, perhaps, just escaping a brutal regime. Is there 
accuracy to that report?
    Have there been a lot of people leaving Russia and can we 
facilitate, particularly those with skills and expertise that 
would be helpful here--can you and can our effort continue to 
facilitate the immigration of people who wish to come to this 
country to make that easier and a source of strength for us?
    Ms. Tracy. So I can confirm, based on regular conversations 
that I have had with Armenian Government officials, that they 
have received a steady stream of Russian citizens since 
February 24th.
    There was a big wave in the spring and then, after the 
mobilization, more. Not all have stayed in Armenia. Some have 
moved on to places like Georgia, Turkey, western Europe, but 
approximately 40,000 have remained in Armenia.
    These are young--many of them are young IT professionals 
and we are, certainly, available and open at the embassy. We 
have a lot of contacts.
    I think we have devoted attention to understanding who is 
in this community so that we can look at the kinds of questions 
that you are raising for the future, and this is something I 
would certainly be happy to stay in touch with you about.
    Senator Romney. Thank you. Mr. Chairman?
    The Chairman. Senator Shaheen?
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and 
congratulations, Ms. Tracy, on your nomination.
    You expressed your concern about Vladimir Kara-Murza in 
your opening testimony and Senator Menendez talked about the 
Americans who are unjustly detained as well in Russia.
    What can you do as ambassador to help keep tension on those 
unjust detentions and what we can--what can we do to try and 
continue to urge Russia to release people who are being held?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator Shaheen, thank you.
    There are public and private aspects to what we can be 
doing and I think publicly the kinds of efforts that we are 
seeing from members of this committee, other members of 
Congress, to keep a spotlight on political prisoners, political 
activists who have been unjustly jailed, as well as our 
detained American citizens that the public spotlight is so 
important so that they do not feel forgotten because I think 
that can happen in isolation.
    One of the most inspiring and early experiences that I had 
with this kind of a situation was actually when I was working 
at the embassy in Moscow in the late 1980s.
    Secretary Schultz visited and championed the refuseniks, 
the divided families. He made a point of meeting with them.
    I had the good fortune to backbench on one of those 
meetings and seeing the comfort, the hope, that families took 
from that even as they remained divided or were being refused 
exit privileges was, for me, just such a clear point of 
understanding on the importance of this public spotlight.
    Privately I commit to this committee that this will be a 
part of my ongoing conversation with Russian officials that 
there will--this will never go unsaid, the importance of the 
release of the wrongfully detained, of the need for appropriate 
consular access for our American citizens, and for the release 
of the political opposition, who, as I said, have been unjustly 
detained.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you.
    This week Russia walked away from continuing negotiations 
around New START, and given Vladimir Putin's rhetoric that 
heightens the nuclear threat because of the war in Ukraine, can 
you talk about how we should think about future efforts to 
reduce weapons with Russia?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, I think, first of all, in looking at 
New START, the focus of the Administration has been on resuming 
inspections under the treaty.
    It is not a gift to Russia. It is a right that we have for 
treaty implementation and those inspections are very important. 
Obviously, Russia receives some of those same rights.
    But I think this can be one avenue of at least 
verification. It is hard to talk about trust in the current 
climate. But I think having some ability to agree on the 
inspections for the verification is one measure that we can 
continue to pursue and I believe the Administration, which was 
ready to meet to talk about resuming inspections, is still 
prepared to do. We see that--the treaty as an instrument of 
stability.
    I think the other approach here that is so very important 
is that we have very clear communications with the highest 
levels of the Russian Government to enforce what--reinforce 
what President Biden has already said, which is that the use of 
nuclear weapons would bring severe consequences and extremely 
irresponsible, and I think that having that clear channel of 
communication so that there are no misunderstandings, no 
misperceptions, is what is absolutely needed right now.
    Senator Shaheen. You have a very difficult challenge, as 
any ambassador to Russia would at this time, because on the one 
hand it is important for future relationships to maintain that 
open channel of communication with Russia.
    On the other hand, we need to condemn their outrageous 
behavior in the war in Ukraine, the obvious war crimes that are 
being committed, the disinformation, the hostile activities 
that they are engaging in in the United States and Europe and 
other parts of the world.
    So help me understand how you walk that fine line and how 
do you raise those concerns while at the same time trying to 
keep an open channel of communication?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, I faced some of these same difficulties 
when I was the Deputy Chief of Mission in Moscow and I found it 
very important to be professional and to be prepared in these 
conversations with Russian officials but to also be frank and 
candid, and I think there is a way to do that.
    That, as I said, can be effective in ensuring that there 
are not misperceptions but it is not easy, having had that 
seat, as I said, as the deputy.
    Publicly, I think we have a lot of tools through our public 
diplomacy platform, our social media tools, to publicly be 
messaging about all the concerns that we have and to shine a 
light to expose the untold suffering that Russia has inflicted 
on Ukraine.
    I think that that is absolutely necessary so that there is 
no question about it. But this is a tough environment. It is 
tough to sometimes penetrate through the propaganda.
    When people have been drinking Kool-aid for a long time it 
is hard to get them to take water. But I think we have to keep 
trying there.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Portman?
    Senator Portman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and again, 
Ambassador Tracy, thank you for stepping up.
    You just talked about the untold suffering that is 
occurring in Ukraine and I appreciate your views on that. How 
do you feel about sanctions on Russia based on the February 
24th invasion and the ongoing war on Ukraine since then?
    We had some data yesterday, a projected 7.1 percent 
decrease in the GDP in Russia in this quarter, the fourth 
quarter, about 4 percent last quarter. In Ukraine, it is about 
40, 50 percent.
    I believe our sanctions are not having the impact that we 
had intended. Can you talk about the sanctions on Russia and 
what we should do, perhaps, to make them more effective if you 
believe that is the right course?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, I absolutely agree that the right 
course is to stay the course on sanctions, to continue 
tightening the sanctions.
    One area that I know you are very familiar with that we 
have talked about is reducing Russia's energy revenues. One 
mechanism that is projected to come into place is the oil price 
cap.
    I think that is already showing some signs, if realized, 
that it could be very effective at reducing some of Russia's 
revenue but at the same time maintaining some stability in the 
oil market.
    I think we need to continue looking at who the actors are 
in the Russian Government and in their wider networks who are a 
part of the pernicious and malign influence that Russia is 
projecting.
    But I am very mindful that, as you pointed out and as I 
have seen, that Ukrainians, particularly now with all of these 
attacks on the civilian infrastructure, on the energy 
infrastructure, are suffering.
    I think we want to have it--these sanctions feeling the 
impact sooner rather than later. I think, based on what I have 
been seeing in reports, we are starting to see sand in the 
gears of the Russian economy.
    We are seeing Russia turning to actors like North Korea and 
Iran for their weapon supplies. We see that Russia has lost 
able-bodied workers through mobilization and through flight, 
and so I think the expectation is that we are going to continue 
to see the impacts of our sanctions. But I cannot predict 
exactly when that point is when----
    Senator Portman. Let me say this. I hope you will, should 
you be confirmed--I think you will be--once you are there that 
you will dig into this issue and give us advice as to how those 
sanctions can be effectively tightened, and from our 
conversation you know how I feel about the energy exports and 
how that really is what is funding the war machine.
    Let me ask you a more--a broad question, a tougher one. How 
do you think you would be most effective in convincing Vladimir 
Putin, his top officials, perhaps some effective communication 
with oligarchs, that the illegal, brutal, and totally 
unprovoked war is also a senseless war and one that is 
counterproductive for Russia? How would you get Russia to the 
bargaining table?
    Ms. Tracy. I think by continuing to do what we are doing 
right now, which is exacting a cost on the battlefield. I think 
we have seen already that President Putin has had to pay 
attention to this issue.
    He recently felt the pressure to meet with mothers of 
soldiers. Even though some of the meeting appeared staged in 
terms of participants, the very fact that he felt the need to 
do that, I think, showed some pressure.
    And so I think continuing to show that that strength of 
support, that unity of purpose, is so very important because my 
impression of President Putin and his mindset is that he thinks 
that he is more patient than we are, that he can wait us out, 
that our unity of purpose and will will crumble before his 
does, and I think that that needs to be demonstrated to him 
that that is not an accurate calculation.
    Senator Portman. Do you believe that he believes that his 
missile supply will last longer than our patience in the West?
    Ms. Tracy. He may, although his missile supply appears to 
be running low.
    Senator Portman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I hope that you will strongly support the aid package from 
Congress to continue our help for all the reasons you just 
stated, that this is a crucial time in Ukraine and to keep 
pressure on Russia. It is important that we maintain our 
support.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Van Hollen?
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and, Madam 
Ambassador, it is great to see you. Congratulations on the 
nomination, and my colleagues have covered a lot of territory, 
including your effort--your future effort to help gain the 
release of unjustly detained Americans and political prisoners 
there.
    I am interested in following up on some of the questions 
regarding your operational flexibility in Moscow as ambassador. 
I am assuming you have had a chance to talk to our outgoing 
ambassador, Ambassador Sullivan. Is that right?
    Ms. Tracy. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Van Hollen. And in terms of just your ability to 
move around either Moscow or the country, how limited is that 
right now?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, there is some limited ability to move 
around outside of Moscow but it requires a lot of effort and 
planning, and because of the size of the embassy now and some 
of the needs that go with ambassadorial travel it can be a 
very--it can shift a lot of the resources away from the 
embassy.
    Obviously, there are some very important priorities, 
though, that require that travel, including visiting American 
citizens who are detained. Ambassador Sullivan described to me 
an ability to move around Moscow.
    But I think, as you can imagine, the climate there and 
because of the position the United States has taken with 
respect to Ukraine we are not always warmly welcomed 
everywhere.
    Senator Van Hollen. Right. So and that leads to my next 
question, but first of all, do you need prior approval from the 
Russian authorities to go outside of Moscow?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, I believe that there are some exempted 
officials from prior notification but I would have to come back 
to confirm to you.
    I believe that the ambassador and a few other staff--there 
is a limited group that has that exception. Most require 
notification and approval to be able to travel outside of 
Moscow.
    Senator Van Hollen. Yeah. If you could get back to me. I am 
curious about whether and to what extent we are applying 
reciprocity here, whether the rules that apply to the Russian 
ambassador here and members of the Russian embassy are similar 
to the ones they are applying to the--our embassy and folks in 
Russia.
    How about in terms of just access to government officials? 
What did Ambassador Sullivan tell you? Is he frozen out? Did he 
have an opportunity to meet with any folks of authority or were 
those conversations to the extent they happened going on 
between, for example, others in the Russian Government and 
folks here in Washington, either at the NSC or the State 
Department or Defense Department?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, he described to me some channels but 
fairly limited channels, and also my impression was some of the 
same people that he was speaking with were speaking with 
officials here in Washington.
    Senator Van Hollen. Right. That has been my impression, 
which is that they have sort of frozen out to the extent that 
they can and they can do a pretty good job of freezing out 
folks in Moscow.
    So I hope you will, at least with respect to non-Russian 
Government officials, push the boundaries of talking to other 
folks, as you say, in civil society and elsewhere, and I would 
be interested in the extent to which we are applying 
reciprocity to their diplomats here.
    Let me just get to this issue of the price cap, which, as 
you know, is scheduled to take effect, I think, December 5th, 
and I think it is a very important move by the G-7, the United 
States, our allies.
    Obviously, lots of questions about how it will work and I 
think some of us believe that, ultimately, this price cap needs 
to be backed up with the threat of sanctions to those who do 
not comply with what the EU is doing.
    But what role, if any, will you have or what do you know 
about our efforts right now to get other countries like India 
and those who have not been part of setting the price cap--
getting those countries to comply?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, my understanding is that we are having 
conversations across the globe. I mean, I, certainly, 
participated in some of these in Armenia about sanctions 
compliance.
    I think that we continue to encourage some of the major 
purchasers of Russian energy to join us. But that is as much as 
I know at this point of those conversations.
    Senator Van Hollen. I appreciate that. Obviously, in order 
for this to be effective we need to sort of shut all the 
loopholes and not just keep the back of the barn open. Thank 
you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Schatz?
    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Ambassador, thank you so much for being willing to continue 
to serve this country in incredibly difficult circumstances.
    I want to follow up on something that Senator Shaheen was 
asking about and also Senator Portman. I want you to describe 
the information environment as you understand it in Russia.
    I guess the most basic question is do you think the Russian 
people know that they are losing?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, thank you.
    My impression is that there are, certainly, Russians who 
have sought out access to outside sources of information to be 
able to more accurately gauge what is happening in terms of 
Russia's war on Ukraine.
    But when you look at the polling that takes place inside of 
Russia, and I think some of it is pretty good and pretty 
credible, there are still many Russians who, because of the 
years of propaganda, are still persuaded that this is a just 
cause, although the rationales keep changing.
    Senator Schatz. And whatever mistakes that may have been 
made are tactical or a general's fault or about equipping and 
training and not a sort of major strategic error. So I want to 
talk to you about the sort of--the way I see it is two vectors, 
right.
    One is years of propaganda and culture and media channels 
that are organized around Putin and the other is increasingly 
that they want to control the inputs, right. They actually do 
want to restrict access to truthful information.
    Freedom House already described Russia as not free in terms 
of information but also noted that there was the biggest 
decline in 2022 in terms of the ability to access truthful 
information.
    I am sort of wondering how you think those two factors are 
interacting right now, because I do not want to get overly 
fixated on making sure people have access to truthful 
information if, in the end, the problem is the propaganda that 
overwhelms anyway.
    China has the ability to actually control all information 
and have the Great Firewall. Russia does not have that 
capability.
    They would like to, but I am not sure they need it, and I 
am wondering how you see those and also how you see the 
Department of State being useful in this conversation to make 
sure that the Russian people know that this is going badly.
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, thank you.
    I think one of the ways in which we are helping both in 
terms of keeping alive some of the credible independent voices 
of media is through some support that the State Department has 
been providing and I think that is very important because these 
are journalists who understand the challenges in the Russian 
media space and the mindset and, I think, having that kind of 
support to homegrown journalists. I have seen this elsewhere in 
my career. People can smell cooked-up storylines.
    But when you have people who understand the mindset who are 
local they are probably best placed to provide that kind of 
entry point into getting at sometimes these narratives of 
misinformation and disinformation.
    So that is one--I think that is one way that we need to 
continue to be very active and engaged is to be supporting 
media--Russian media who are in opposition in exile to be able 
to project.
    But it is--again, it is a very tough environment. But I do 
not think that we can afford to walk away from championing 
internet freedom of making sure that people have access.
    Senator Schatz. No, I agree, and I think this is a tough 
nut to crack. It just seems to me that we have to understand 
the information environment as it is evolving pretty fast 
because it was ever thus as it relates to the propaganda 
channels. But this new desire to control truthful information 
presents additional complications and I think the State 
Department is going to have some navigating to do.
    But before you start just jumping in and tweeting out 
things or whatever, we have to have a theory of the case about 
what exactly is going on here and why Russian public opinion 
remains pretty stubborn even in the face of at least accessible 
facts.
    They may not have them in their brains but they--it is 
theoretically accessible via computer in a way that it is not, 
for instance, in China.
    So thank you.
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, I promise I will not just jump in and 
start tweeting.
    Senator Schatz. That is my job.
    The Chairman. And you do it so well.
    Let me--a second vote for members who have not voted should 
know that it has started.
    Senator Young is next. But then after him is Senator 
Murphy. I have asked Senator Murphy to preside until the chair 
can return.
    Thank you.
    Senator Young. Welcome, Ms. Tracy. Good to have you here.
    Earlier this year, my Senate colleagues and I introduced 
legislation to sanction Chinese financial institutions that 
conduct transactions with any Russian financial institutions 
trying to avert sanctions by using China's alternative to 
SWIFT.
    The end goal of this legislation was to encourage Beijing 
to consider the costs of siding with Putin in his barbaric 
attack on Ukraine.
    From your perspective, can you expand on how actions like 
this from the international community have prompted Putin's 
allies and friends of convenience to rethink their 
relationships with Moscow?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, thank you.
    I think that the kinds of conversations that the 
Administration and our partners and allies in Europe and 
elsewhere have been having with not just government officials 
in the PRC but also the private company have--private sector 
have had an effect.
    I think there is a very clear understanding that evading 
these sanctions, crossing these sanctions, will bring 
consequences. That is my understanding, based on the 
conversations that have taken place thus far.
    But I think that we are going to have to remain vigilant 
and I think you are--if I am taking that point from you, it is 
the importance of vigilance here.
    Senator Young. So in the spirit of vigilance, have you seen 
and maybe could you point to some changes that have occurred in 
the Russia-Chinese bilateral relationship, positive or 
negative, since we took this action?
    Ms. Tracy. One very telling episode to me was the--what 
happened in Tashkent earlier this year. This was in the fall, I 
believe. It was a gathering. President Xi was there. There were 
other leaders from the region there. And, certainly, President 
Putin looked very uncomfortable.
    I mean, this has been well noted in the press and he had to 
acknowledge that after that initial announcement back in--
during the Olympics of the no limits partnership that his 
Chinese colleague was expressing some concern and had 
questions, and the fact that he had to say that publicly was a 
pretty big deal.
    We saw--and we saw some other interactions at that 
particular conference that, I think, again, showed that some of 
Russia's partners were and are uneasy with the course that 
Russia has been taking.
    Senator Young. Thank you.
    So as the months have lingered on since that point Vladimir 
Putin has found himself on his back foot, to put it charitably, 
and he has been increasingly desperate, it seems, and Moscow 
has signaled from time to time that it is willing to respond 
asymmetrically to the West in various ways.
    Where do you assess our interests are most vulnerable to 
these Russian acts of asymmetric retaliation?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, in terms of the asymmetrical behavior, 
some of it is falling on our mission operations, something that 
was touched on earlier.
    I think that we also see Russia projecting a very 
pernicious and malign influence in places like Africa where we 
do not always have an easy answer, and in this case I am 
thinking of groups like the Wagner Company, who are really, as 
I said, a pernicious influence that is destabilizing good 
governance efforts, the--fueling corruption in some of its 
activities.
    So this is--these are at least----
    Senator Young. Gray zone warfare, as it were, right?
    Ms. Tracy. Yes.
    Senator Young. Yeah. And before I return--yield to the--
back to the chairman, just with respect to that discrete 
threat, do you have any thoughts about how we best safeguard 
ourselves and work with our allies to safeguard them against 
these actions?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, this is where I think we need just to 
maintain some very tight coordination. We need to be talking 
very, very frankly and candidly with our allies and we need to 
do things in unison.
    I think this is, certainly, something I have seen across my 
career that when we act with partners and allies on some of 
these tough transnational issues or gray zone issues that we 
are in a much better place.
    But I think it is--there is a lot happening right now, and 
so that we do not lose sight of some of these places that maybe 
are not on the European continent but actually have a nexus to 
what Russia is doing in Ukraine.
    Senator Young. Thank you, Ms. Tracy.
    Chairman?
    Senator Murphy [presiding.] I am recognizing myself under 
Senator Menendez's instructions and then going to Senator 
Risch.
    Good to see you. Thank you for stepping up at a time of 
peril to serve in maybe the most difficult diplomatic post that 
we have. We are grateful for your time with us here today.
    I want to build on Senator Young's questions and build on 
your prior service in Armenia. Senator Young was asking about 
this sort of set of asymmetric threats that Russia brings to 
bear.
    Russia thrives in neighboring countries with weak rule of 
law. Some of Russia's tools are pretty sophisticated. Some of 
them are not.
    Some of them are just paying people off in order to do what 
they want, which is easier to do in places that do not have a 
strong system of rules, a strong democratic history, a free 
press.
    So maybe drawing on your experience in Armenia, talk a 
little bit about how America's commitment to the rule of law is 
not just about trying to sort of stand up healthy democracies. 
It is also about pushing back on Russia's ability to get what 
it wants by preying on countries that have weak rule of law.
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, thank you.
    I think that, first of all, I want to acknowledge with 
respect to Armenia, and this is true in a--for a number of 
former Soviet Union countries, the great importance of the 
investment that the United States has made through assistance 
that Congress has provided to development assistance, to 
economic development, but maybe most importantly to investment 
in people, young leaders, and that matters because what we saw, 
for instance, in Armenia in 2018 this was totally homegrown, 
the leadership of and the movement to call for an end to 
corruption in government.
    And so when I think about--when I think about that, part of 
that also relates to Russia. As I noted earlier, I think what 
we have seen in the last two elections in Armenia is people 
turning away from the model that Russia offers, looking for 
something better for a government that is accountable.
    And even though people had experienced something very 
traumatic in 2020 with the conflict they did not want to go 
back to corruption and I think it is because they see what 
Russia represents.
    They see how the country is run, and I think that, as I 
said, that that investment in people who have the opportunities 
to be credible journalists, to provide strong accountability to 
government institutions, I mean, these are all the things that 
we can be continuing to do, not just in places like Armenia, 
that I think act as a hedge against the kind of model and 
malign influence that Russia represents.
    Senator Murphy. Many of us see this work in the Balkans as 
well, countries that have weaker rules structures. Those are 
the places where Russia plays more vigorously.
    You also speak to this broader opportunity that exists in 
every crisis. You can always find a little hidden nugget of 
opportunity and there are countries all along Russia's 
periphery that are now entertaining closer relations with the 
United States as a hedge against a neighbor who has now shown 
no compunction about moving troops across borders. Central Asia 
is another example of that.
    In the remaining 50 seconds just a word from you on what 
you have learned about Moscow's current disposition on a 
nuclear weapon-armed Iran.
    Russia stood with us in the JCPOA negotiations. They now 
are in a different place because they are relying on Iran to 
provide critical weapons for the fight in Ukraine.
    So have you learned that there is any prospect for Russia 
continuing to be a partner if we were ever able to get back 
into a conversation with Iran on their nuclear future or has 
their relationship with Tehran fundamentally changed?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, this is not an area that I have had a 
chance to have consultations on or been read into. But, 
clearly, I will be happy to take that question for the record 
and be back to you.
    Senator Murphy. Great. I will follow up with you on that. 
Thank you.
    Senator Risch?
    Senator Risch. Thank you very much, and thank you, Ms. 
Tracy, for being willing to take on this job. This is going to 
be a tough one. There is no question about it. Probably the 
toughest one you have had and that you ever will have in your 
position with the State Department.
    And thank you for talking with me about the sensitive area 
that we talked about and we will talk about in another--in a 
classified setting at some point. I am glad you understand the 
issues there and are willing to engage on that.
    I would like to get your thoughts generally on diplomat--
what you envision diplomatic engagement is going to be like in 
Moscow. Obviously, you are going to spend a lot of your time on 
the related things like security and facilities and management 
and staffing.
    But, obviously, we all know what the usual type of 
diplomatic engagement is with a country in discussing this with 
our diplomatic engagement with Russia, with NSC people and 
State Department people. Seems to be a pretty heavy lift at the 
present time and what--have you got any thoughts on that of how 
you will engage in that?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, thank you--Ranking Member, thank you 
very much, and you are absolutely right. This is probably going 
to be the toughest assignment of my career.
    One of--we were already seeing during my tenure as DCM in 
Moscow a real shrinking of the channels of communication. The 
Russians withheld a lot of meetings from us.
    But I think one thing that we had to continue to do was to 
ask and to probe and to see where we were able to open up 
channels. So I, certainly, intend to do that to see what that 
may yield and Ambassador Sullivan shared with me the channels 
that he was able to maintain.
    Another--I think another very important constituency in 
Moscow are our partners and allies and ensuring that we are 
lashed up there very closely. So that is something that I saw 
when I was in Moscow in my earlier assignment that I thought 
was very important to being effective as an embassy, and then 
to the extent that I can to be reaching out and getting out.
    I do not know what kind of reception I will get in some 
places. I mean, I think this is going to be one of those 
situations where you have to test the water.
    But I do think it is important that we continue to be out 
and about to the extent that we can.
    Senator Risch. I really appreciate that and I think that is 
probably the best you are going to be able to do, what you just 
described.
    I would note that, I think, as far as our allies are 
concerned a good share of them are not in any better shape than 
we are as far as their relationship with Moscow. So you will 
have comrades in arms there, in any event.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman [presiding]. Thank you.
    Senator Barrasso?
    Senator Barrasso. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
Congratulations.
    I want to talk a little bit about uranium because Russia 
uses energy as a geopolitical weapon. For years I have raised 
concerns about the risks posed by being dependent on Russia for 
energy resources.
    In 2021 Russia was our third largest supplier of uranium, 
14 percent of U.S. demand, and every dollar we give to Russia 
state supports Putin's war on Ukraine.
    So despite the Administration's so-called ban on Russian 
energy we are still importing Russian uranium. Do you agree 
that the U.S. needs to ban Russian uranium?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, my understanding is that we are working 
very closely with our allies and partners, including in the G-
7, to reduce and ultimately eliminate our reliance on Russian 
uranium services.
    Several countries in Europe have taken important steps to 
reduce their reliance on Russian uranium services and nuclear 
fuel since the beginning of Russia's war in Ukraine.
    The administration is also focused on this issue here at 
home by working to identify domestic solutions that support our 
foreign policy goals and address our own strategic 
vulnerability.
    And I would just commit to you that I will, certainly, be 
supporting those efforts and looking for ways that we can 
reduce that strategic vulnerability.
    Senator Barrasso. In terms of strategic vulnerabilities 
then we move on to rising energy prices and what that means for 
helping Russia fund their war--their killing machine.
    Reducing the amount of Russian energy going to Europe would 
hurt Russia's economy. The oil and gas revenues make up about 
half of Russia's national budget.
    In 2021 Russia sold $100 billion worth of oil and natural 
gas to Europe. With natural gas prices increasing, oil 
surpassing, at times, $100 a barrel, more of our allies' money, 
basically, lines the pockets of Putin. It is a windfall, I 
believe, for Russia. As a result, the amount of Russian energy 
going to Europe is a major problem.
    Is there a national security issue when our allies and 
partners are increasingly dependent on Russian energy sources?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, what I believe we are seeing in the 
wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine is that our allies and 
partners have seen that Russia is not a reliable energy 
partner.
    We have seen significant drops in certain parts of the 
energy landscape. I think we are expecting, potentially, to see 
more starting December 5th and we need to continue doing that 
to--as a part of that, not just focusing on reducing the 
dependency on Russia but then providing alternatives that can 
give the Europeans a stable energy supply from other locations.
    Senator Barrasso. You used the phrase alternatives and then 
a reliable energy partner, which is what they are looking for 
long term. Do you support quickly increasing U.S. exports of 
natural gas to Europe to help reduce their dependence on 
Russia's natural gas?
    Ms. Tracy. Yes, Senator. I do.
    Senator Barrasso. I wanted to talk about what is happening 
with Ukrainian children, and you have read that since Russia's 
invasion of Ukraine there have been reports of Putin ordering 
the transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia to be adopted and 
become citizens of Russia.
    Our U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, 
reported that thousands of Ukrainian children have been taken 
from their homes or orphanages before being put up for adoption 
in Russia. She said more than 1,800 children--I mean, it is an 
astonishingly large number--were transferred from Russian-
controlled areas of Ukraine to Russia I think she said in just 
July alone, so in one month.
    In May, Putin signed a decree making it easier for Russia 
to adopt and give citizenship to Ukrainian children. The New 
York Times had an article in October titled ``Using Adoptions, 
Russia turns Ukrainian children into the spoils of war.'' The 
Associated Press had an article titled ``How Russia grabs 
Ukrainian kids and makes them Russians.''
    So how can the U.S. and the international community hold 
Putin accountable for the large-scale forced relocation and 
deportation--of this program?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, what you have just described is 
absolutely sickening and horrible and I, certainly, commit to 
you and to this committee that one of the first things I will 
be doing is--if confirmed, is reaching out to my colleague, 
Ambassador Brink, in Kyiv so that we have a good coordination 
there on some of the information that is coming out.
    I think how we hold Russia accountable is to support and 
engage in as much documentation as we can to expose these 
horrible practices and then, I think, to look for approaches 
and avenues where we can, certainly, in the case cases that you 
are describing where we have had children separated to get 
children back to their parents.
    I do not have an answer right here for how that is. But I 
do think it is very important to have that channel or that--
have that emphasis on approaches that look at restoring 
children to their families.
    Senator Barrasso. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Ambassador Tracy, one last question. We had a hearing here 
on the Caucasus. It was one of the most disappointing hearings 
I have ever conducted.
    You have been the ambassador to Armenia. So let me ask you, 
and I relate this to your post that you would be confirmed for, 
have you seen the videos of the execution of Armenian soldiers 
by Azerbaijan?
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, yes, I have, and I have also seen the 
video of--it was one of the most sickening things I have seen 
in my life--of the mutilation and desecration of a female 
Armenian soldier, and when the report first emerged of--that 
this video was circulating I reached out to Armenia's human 
rights ombudsperson, Kristinne Grigoryan, who is a rising star 
in Armenia.
    She has been a very important partner with us in law 
enforcement reform but she had moved over to the ombudsperson's 
office.
    I went to see her. She was engaging in efforts to document, 
authenticate, what we were seeing in these videos. She was 
working, she told me--and I have great confidence in what she 
was saying--to use best international practices and they were 
able to identify--they identified the female soldier. I think 
they were identifying then--there were some other bodies in the 
video. And so----
    The Chairman. So they not only identified, did they 
authenticate that, in fact, these actions took place?
    Ms. Tracy. I think what they authenticated that--who these 
individuals were and the state in which their bodies were. What 
I remember from--particularly from the video with the female 
soldier being mutilated it was hard to see who was acting in 
the video.
    But what I want to assure you of is that we reported these 
conversations, what the ombudsperson's office was doing, and 
what we are focused on right now is accountability and I think 
accountability is----
    The Chairman. Who did you report them to? Who did you 
report them to?
    Ms. Tracy. To the State Department. To Washington.
    The Chairman. Well, this is at least a much better set of 
answers than I got at the other hearing where no one knew 
about--either did not know about the videos or in the case of 
Ambassador Reeker did know about the videos but no one had done 
anything to determine the authenticity and legitimacy of it.
    I have no reason to dispute the videos that I have seen but 
it seems to me--and the reason I want to connect this here, you 
are the present ambassador to Armenia and you are nominated for 
something else. But here is the point.
    We need our ambassadors, particularly in places of 
conflict, to be able to pursue what the truth is so that we, as 
policy holders, can then decide what we do about that truth.
    And since you are going to Russia--obviously, Russians are 
being arrested for their dissidency. Others have been attacked. 
Some supposedly have been killed.
    We need, to the extent possible, the U.S. ambassador in 
Moscow to do what I would want to have seen done as it relates 
to Armenia, to identify where these abuses have taken place, 
try to authenticate it, and then report on it in a way that 
then we--that it is actionable, at the end of the day.
    So that is the spirit in which I am asking you the 
questions. I expect that if you are confirmed you will do that 
in Moscow to the best of your ability.
    Ms. Tracy. Senator, yes, I will. I, certainly, pledge that 
and very much due to some of the experiences that I have had as 
ambassador to Armenia, some of what I have seen from conflict 
there, and the need for accountability and to pursue justice in 
some of these very egregious situations.
    The Chairman. All right. Without accountability there is 
not justice.
    Thank you for your testimony before the committee. We will 
be submitting--members will be submitting questions for the 
record. I would urge you to answer them as expeditiously and 
fully as possible so that we can consider your nomination 
before a business committee.
    With the thanks of the committee, you are excused.
    Ms. Tracy. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, members of the 
committee, thank you very much.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Let us bring up our second panel.
    [Pause.]
    The Chairman. All right. We would like to have our nominees 
take their seats. We are all having a good time.
    The hearing continues. The second panel--we consider 
remaining four nominations. I understand that Senator Shaheen 
will be introducing Ambassador Fisher and Senator Van Hollen 
will be introducing Ms. Spahn.
    Let us turn to Senator Shaheen first.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and 
congratulations to each of the nominees this afternoon. I 
appreciate your letting me go first since I have a 4:00 o'clock 
appointment. I will be back, however.
    But it really is my honor to introduce Ambassador Fisher 
today as this committee considers her nomination to serve as 
U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus.
    Ambassador Fisher and I spent a very interesting day in 
Warsaw right before the start of the war in Ukraine, actually, 
this year and I know and had reinforced for me then what a 
great job she has done.
    She has served our country with distinction from her 
previous roles as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for 
Western Europe and the European Union to Deputy Permanent 
Representative of the U.S. mission to NATO.
    Most recently, Ambassador Fisher represented the United 
States as the Special Envoy to Belarus and that is the role in 
which we were dining in Warsaw.
    However, against circumstances not of her own doing 
Ambassador Fisher has not had the opportunity to put her 
ambassadorial title to full use because despite being nominated 
and confirmed by this body as Ambassador to Belarus in 2020, 
the first time the position had been filled since 2008, 
Ambassador Fisher was forced to serve as a U.S. Special Envoy 
in Lithuania after the Belarusian authorities refused to grant 
her accreditation.
    Ambassador Fisher was a committed partner to the Belarusian 
people, nonetheless, who continue to peacefully advocate for a 
democratic future for themselves and their country.
    Ambassador Fisher recognized the need to keep the 
democratic movement in the spotlight and secure meetings for 
opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya with U.S. leaders, 
including President Biden.
    This was critical to conveying to the rest of Europe and 
the world that she has support from the United States, both 
Ambassador Fisher and the opposition.
    Ambassador Fisher also worked effectively with Congress to 
humanize the plight of the Belarusian people and keep members 
apprised on the political situation in the country.
    With her support in her role as Special Envoy, I co-founded 
the Free Belarus Caucus with Senator Wicker to continue 
advocating for democracy and free and fair elections in Belarus 
where Putin's puppet Lukashenko continues to tighten his 
authoritarian grip, crack down on free press, and threaten the 
sovereignty of Ukraine.
    Ambassador Fisher showed why this role is so critical. I 
saw Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya a few weeks ago where she also 
called for a successor to this important position. I hope that 
the State Department can announce a successor without delay.
    I look forward to see her apply the same level--he or she 
apply the same level of energy and expertise to that position 
as Ambassador Fisher has and I expect that Ambassador Fisher 
will apply that level of energy and expertise to her new 
position as Ambassador to Cyprus.
    Amid renewed tensions with Turkey and Russia's malign 
influence throughout Europe, we need a diplomat like Ambassador 
Fisher to promote American interests in the Mediterranean.
    I know she will continue to serve the American people well 
and I urge my colleagues to advance her nomination without 
delay.
    Congratulations, Ambassador Fisher.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Van Hollen?
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member 
Risch, Senator Shaheen, and I want to congratulate all the 
nominees here today and I think the President has chosen 
wisely.
    I am here to introduce the President's nominee to serve as 
the next director of the Peace Corps, Carol Spahn. The 
President has picked somebody with vast experience, impeccable 
character, and sharp intellect, and President Biden has also 
selected a Marylander for this role, which Senator Cardin and I 
think shows a special wisdom.
    But beyond being a Marylander and, very seriously, there is 
no doubt in my mind that Ms. Spahn has the background and the 
wisdom to excel in this role. From January 2021 to November 
2022, during some of the toughest days of the pandemic, she 
served as CEO of the Peace Corps and had to navigate the Corps 
through that difficult period.
    As most Corps members had to return home, many were then 
effectively deployed to support public health vaccination 
campaigns across the United States, including over 60 Corps 
volunteers in my state of Maryland.
    Her good stewardship of the Corps helped get shots in arms 
and save lives across our country. That effort was just the 
most recent chapter in a storied career of service.
    Ms. Spahn's connection to the Peace Corps dates all the way 
back to 1994 when she served as a volunteer in Romania. Since 
then she has been chief of operations in the Africa region and 
country director for Malawi, among other important assignments 
both inside and outside the Corps.
    Beyond this impressive resume and set of assignments, I am 
absolutely confident and I am confident that the committee will 
agree that Ms. Spahn has the character and qualities that will 
help her succeed in this important position.
    I had the opportunity to speak with her many months ago 
talking about the important role of the Peace Corps around the 
world, including in Africa where Senator Rounds and I as 
subcommittee chair and ranking member spend a lot of time.
    I was struck by Ms. Spahn's devotion to the Peace Corps and 
her determination to serve our fellow Americans and others 
around the world. That meeting left no doubt in my mind that 
she is ready for this important challenge at this important 
moment.
    Mr. Chairman, in my view, the Peace Corps is more than an 
opportunity for service. It is an important part of our 
identity as a nation and central to what we stand for.
    I have witnessed that truth firsthand. As many of you know, 
I grew up in a Foreign Service family and spent many early 
years overseas.
    One memory from that stands out with respect to the Peace 
Corps. I was traveling with my parents to a remote village in 
Sri Lanka as sort of an early teenager. It was a very remote 
village. We went into a hut there and there inside the hut hung 
a portrait of John F. Kennedy.
    And the reason that portrait was there even 10 years after 
President Kennedy had been assassinated and half a world away 
from the United States of America was that the Peace Corps had 
been in that village.
    The Peace Corps had been there helping dig wells, helping 
with sanitation projects, and that left an imprint and memory 
on all the villagers about what America stood for and the fact 
that we could be a force of good and for justice and hope 
around the world.
    And, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Risch, we must continue 
to live up to that standard and I am absolutely confident that 
Carol Spahn can help us do exactly that so that years from now 
there will continue to be a presence of the American force for 
good in villages halfway around the world and people know what 
the United States stands for, and I know she will continue to 
carry that torch and that tradition.
    Thank you.
    The Chairman. Thank you. Thank you to both of our 
colleagues, distinguished members of this committee.
    Let me say to all of our nominees congratulations, again, 
to you, to your families who are part of service in our 
country. We appreciate their willingness to sacrifice.
    Let me just go through a few of our nominees and then we 
will hold--we will listen to Senator Risch and then begin 
testimony.
    I will begin with Ms. Kavin. Is that the correct 
pronunciation?
    Ms. Kvien. Kvien.
    The Chairman. Kvien. Kvien. Okay. I am sorry.
    Who has been nominated to be the Ambassador to Armenia. It 
is a challenging moment for Armenia. We have seen recent 
attacks from Azerbaijan, videos of what appeared to be war 
crimes as well as a long-standing humanitarian crisis brought 
on by the war in Nagorno-Karabakh.
    I was incredibly disappointed by the State Department's 
responses in our recent hearing on the South Caucasus and so, 
Ms. Kvien, I expect you as well as all of our nominees today to 
respect the committee's oversight role and be responsive to the 
committee's requests for information.
    In the case of Armenia, it will be your responsibility to 
ensure that the American people do not look the other way when 
we uncover human rights violations and atrocities committed 
against Armenia.
    Armenia is connected to the United States by the love and 
concern of countless Armenian-American families. This is a 
diaspora community that is on the knife edge between the hope 
of peace and the terror of ethnic cleansing.
    Ambassador Fisher, your appointment to Cyprus comes as this 
important country is growing closer to the United States. 
Cyprus is a key part in the Western response to Russian 
aggression in Ukraine. Cyprus' energy resources can and should 
be part of the solution to Putin's energy warfare directed at 
Europe.
    At the same time, I look forward to hearing how you plan to 
tackle the challenge of an increasingly belligerent Erdogan in 
Turkey. I want to hear your views today on Erdogan's 
assertiveness in Varosha as well as what you will do to ensure 
the sustainability of the U.N. mandate in Cyprus.
    The Administration's decision to lift restrictions on the 
sale of U.S. military equipment to Cyprus as authorized in the 
Eastern Mediterranean Security and Energy Partnership Law that 
I authored was welcome news.
    I look forward to hearing your vision on how we can take 
this relationship to the next level in further developing our 
energy and security cooperation.
    I would also like to hear your views on the 3+1 regional 
format among the United States, Cyprus, Israel, and Greece, for 
which the Administration, unfortunately, has done little to 
promote over the past two years.
    Ms. Spahn, you will take charge of the Peace Corps as you 
continue to return thousands of volunteers back to the field. 
It has been two years since the Peace Corps had to make the 
difficult decision to send all volunteers home due to the 
pandemic.
    I know you have played an important role in this process, 
ensuring volunteer and host community safety and implementing 
reforms to adapt to a post-COVID world.
    The Peace Corps represents one of the United States' 
greatest foreign policy and diplomacy tools, helping those in 
need around the world.
    Even as competitors and adversaries try to challenge us in 
every corner of the globe, the Peace Corps represents the 
United States to the world who we truly are, a giving and 
generous nation.
    As you know, I introduced the Peace Corps Reauthorization 
Act with Senator Risch. The bill passed out of our committee by 
voice vote in July. We need to see it enacted this year.
    This bipartisan legislation supports the real-time needs of 
volunteers as they reenter the field as well as volunteers 
returning home, which are critical for a well-run Peace Corps.
    So I look forward to hearing from you about your vision for 
the Peace Corps as it meets these challenges and seizes the 
opportunities as a critical arm of U.S. foreign policy.
    Ms. Dyer, as director of the Office to Combat and Monitor 
Trafficking you will be tackling one of the most heinous crimes 
in the world, and despite progress in recent years modern day 
slavery remains prevalent.
    Human trafficking remains a horrific reality for tens of 
millions of people around the world. We need to redouble our 
effort to prevent trafficking, hold traffickers accountable, 
and to support victims.
    I expect you to be a strong, effective leader at the Office 
to Combat and Monitor Trafficking. You are exceptionally 
qualified for this position, given your extensive experience, 
and as a nominee of both the Bush and Biden administrations, it 
is clear that your commitment to the issue transcends party 
lines.
    As you know, I was proud to pass out of the committee 
earlier this year a bipartisan bill with Senator Risch, the 
International Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization 
Act.
    I urge my colleagues in the Senate to agree to its swift 
passage on the floor and I look forward to hearing about how 
you intend to elevate and advance this important fight.
    With that, let me turn to the distinguished ranking member, 
Senator Risch, for his comments.
    Senator Risch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to 
the panel for being here today. Certainly, four important 
appointments.
    On Armenia, the U.S. has a valuable role to play in 
resolving the tenuous relationship between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan. At the centerpiece of the conflict, of course, is 
the disputed territories and the need to find a stable solution 
that protects the rights of Armenians and Azeris living there.
    With Russia pulling back in the region there is now a 
limited opportunity for the U.S. to take a stronger role and to 
help end the bloodshed.
    With regard to Cyprus, our relationship is changing due to 
Cyprus' progress in cleaning up its financial sector as well as 
its growing ties with Greece and Israel.
    Just a few months ago, the State Department waived the arms 
embargo that it has had on Cyprus since 1987, which will open a 
door to closer cooperation and, hopefully, some improvements in 
areas of mutual interest in the Eastern Mediterranean.
    I expect that strong U.S. leadership will continue to 
advance this progress and closer bilateral relations will open 
up new opportunities for the United States to work with parties 
on the island to find a lasting and stable solution for 
reunification.
    I thank Ambassador Fisher for being willing to serve the 
United States in Cyprus and I look forward to hearing how you 
will approach these complex issues.
    I am glad to finally have a nominee for the important 
position of Ambassador-at-Large to Monitor and Combat 
Trafficking. Thus far, I have been disappointed with the Biden 
administration's communication with Congress on human 
trafficking and hope that filling this position will grant this 
important issue the attention that it deserves.
    As the chairman noted, he and I worked together on the 
International Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization 
Act, which would reform and modernize the State Department's 
efforts to combat and monitor human trafficking. We look 
forward to progress.
    I look forward to hearing from you, Ms. Dyer, on your views 
of how to improve U.S. efforts to combat human trafficking 
around the globe.
    And, finally, after COVID-19 forced a total global 
evacuation of the Peace Corps, the organization has taken some 
steps to increase safety measures as well as gradual reentry to 
countries of service.
    Additionally, it is no secret that the Peace Corps has had 
its share of safety and security concerns prior to this global 
evacuation. That is why I worked with the chairman on our Peace 
Corps reauthorization bill to address these challenges and 
ensure that today's volunteers are equipped with the best 
training and knowledge to reenter their countries of service.
    I want to thank you, Ms. Spahn, for your prior service in 
the Peace Corps and for the willingness to serve in this 
capacity. I look forward to hearing how you will approach the 
ongoing safety and security issues that many volunteers should 
you be confirmed and I know you have had quite a bit of 
experience in that direction.
    So, Ms. Spahn, we are looking forward to good and great and 
glorious things from you.
    With that, I will turn it back to the chair. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Okay. We will turn to our nominees. Your full 
statements will be included in the record, without objection. 
We ask that each of you summarize your statement in about five 
minutes so that members of the committee can engage with you in 
a conversation.
    We will start with you, Ambassador Fisher, and go down the 
line, okay?

STATEMENT OF HON. JULIE D. FISHER OF TENNESSEE, A CAREER MEMBER 
       OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-
    COUNSELOR,NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND 
PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC 
                           OF CYPRUS

    Ms. Fisher. Thank you, sir.
    Please allow me just to say a quick word of appreciation to 
Senator Shaheen for her kind words and for her support. She has 
shown so much leadership on issues on which I have worked--
NATO, Belarus, now Cyprus--and she has truly been a champion 
for those of us in the State Department. I very much appreciate 
that.
    Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Risch, members of this 
committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you 
today as President Biden's nominee to be the ambassador to the 
Republic of Cyprus.
    As ambassador designate for Belarus and then subsequently 
as Special Envoy, it was a privilege for me to work closely 
with the members and staff of this committee.
    If given the opportunity to serve as ambassador to Cyprus, 
I count on our continued consultation and coordination to 
advance key priorities in the context of our fundamental 
commitment to a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace.
    These objectives have defined my career and in my 
leadership roles I have sought to build teams with a clear view 
of our guiding mission to protect and advance the interests of 
the American people.
    I know firsthand there is no greater responsibility than 
the safety and security of American citizens and our embassy 
team. If confirmed, this would be my highest priority.
    So, in this context, I am committed to continuing our 
efforts to locate and return home three Americans still missing 
since the tragic events of 1974.
    This committee knows well that Cyprus sits on a critical 
seam between the Middle East and Europe. The Republic of Cyprus 
is a highly valued partner, and our bilateral relationship has 
deepened significantly in recent years on a range of priorities 
from strengthening security in the Eastern Med to expanding 
economic and commercial ties.
    The results of this cooperation have been most evident in 
the Republic of Cyprus' partnership in responding to Russia's 
brutal, full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Our National Security 
Strategy highlights Russia's immediate and persistent threat to 
international peace and stability, and calls for transatlantic 
unity in countering Russia's threat.
    The Republic of Cyprus has had a direct impact in holding 
the Kremlin to account for its war of choice against Ukraine. 
As a result of this values-based decision, Cyprus has weathered 
significant economic disruption and, despite this, continues to 
take actions that demonstrate its commitment to stand with 
Ukraine, including welcoming more than 14,000 Ukrainian 
refugees this year.
    I am pleased to see our bilateral cooperation growing in 
new and tangible ways. In April, we jointly opened the U.S.-
funded state-of-the-art Cyprus Center for Land, Open Seas, and 
Port Security to strengthen maritime and border security 
training across the region.
    We also signed a science and technology agreement, paving 
the way for increased scientific collaboration between our 
nations, and our shared commitment to combat trafficking in 
persons is yielding meaningful progress.
    Cyprus is an increasingly inviting market for American tech 
companies and American firms are leading the development of 
offshore hydrocarbon resources around the island.
    These investments will help Cyprus become a critical 
contributor to Europe's energy security, countering both 
Russia's weaponization of energy and PRC coercive economic 
influence in the region.
    If confirmed, I will work to ensure that American 
enterprise and American products are what come to mind when 
Cypriots look for trusted business partners, and specifically 
with the leadership of this committee Cyprus, Greece, and 
Israel plus the United States are forging new ground in the 3+1 
format to promote regional cooperation on a broad range of 
pressing issues.
    Mr. Chairman, let me say this regarding the division of 
Cyprus. The United States remains clear that the status quo is 
unacceptable.
    If given the opportunity to serve, I will use the full 
weight of my office to support Cypriot-led U.N.-facilitated 
efforts to reunify Cyprus as a bi-zonal bi-communal federation 
with political equality for all Cypriots.
    I will meet with Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to 
advance our unwavering commitment to human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, and seek their feedback as they work to 
realize the benefits of reaching the comprehensive settlement 
which has eluded them for decades.
    There is just no escaping the unjust costs of division that 
have fallen on all Cypriots.
    In a 2014 visit to Cyprus, then Vice President Biden 
outlined a vision for a future generation of Cypriots who might 
grow up without the burden of conflict. This vision can animate 
new efforts towards a reunified Cyprus, creating meaningful 
prosperity for all Cypriots and unlocking greater stability in 
this critical region.
    Finally, I would like to acknowledge that I am joined today 
by my husband, Matthew Fisher. I would not be before you 
without his support over my 27-year career. He has been my 
chief adviser on bidding, my chief morale officer on tough 
days, and chief of dinner procurement on late nights. I have 
been so very lucky to have him in my corner.
    Chairman, members of the committee, thank you again for the 
opportunity to appear today and I do look forward to your 
questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Fisher follows:]


               Prepared Statement of Hon. Julie D. Fisher

    Senator Shaheen, thank you for your kind words and for the support 
that you have shown to my State colleagues and me over many years. I am 
deeply grateful for your leadership on the range of issues on which I 
have worked--from NATO to Belarus and now Cyprus.

feedback as they work to realize the benefits of reaching the 
comprehensive settlement which has eluded them for decades. There is no 
escaping the unjust costs of division that have fallen on all Cypriots.
    In a 2014 visit to Cyprus, then-Vice President Biden outlined a 
vision for a future generation of Cypriots who might grow up without 
the burden of conflict. This vision can animate new efforts towards a 
reunified Cyprus, creating meaningful prosperity for all Cypriots and 
unlocking greater stability in this critical region.
    Finally, I'd like to acknowledge that I am joined today by my 
husband, Matthew Fisher. I would not be before you without his support 
over my 27-year career. He has been my chief advisor on bidding, my 
chief morale officer on tough days, and chief of dinner procurement on 
late nights. I have been so very lucky to have him in my corner.
    Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the committee, thank you 
again for the opportunity to appear before you today. I welcome your 
questions.


    The Chairman. Thank you for your testimony. I will just say 
out of all of those titles you gave your husband the dinner one 
is very important.
    [Laughter.]
    The Chairman. So as Senator Merkley has a request to speak 
to Ms. Spahn's nomination because he has to leave so I have 
agreed to do that.
    Senator Merkley?
    Senator Merkley. I am going to keep this extremely brief.
    First, to all four of you, thank you very much for your 
service to international diplomacy. It is so important that we 
get you into these key positions with various challenges we 
have in the world.
    I, unfortunately, do have a scheduling conflict and the 
hearing went a little longer than we anticipated. I am going to 
have to leave before the rest of the testimony and will not be 
able to ask questions, but I did want to say how pleased I am 
and how much I appreciate the ranking member and the chairman 
scheduling the hearing for the--our Peace Corps nominee, Carol 
Spahn.
    I believe in the beautiful work of the Peace Corps around 
the world, what the volunteers do in so many ways to assist 
some of the most challenging places. It is very challenging 
work.
    Having spent some time working in villages in different 
parts of the world I identify with it, though I was not a Peace 
Corps member, and this is an exciting time with COVID declining 
and the opportunity to send volunteers back into many parts of 
the world, and I know that one has to monitor the violence and 
the conflict to decide when and where one can reestablish 
nominees.
    I am very pleased to see the first delegation having gone 
to Vietnam and I just want to thank you specifically, Ms. 
Spahn, for your--bringing your Peace Corps experience to bear. 
I hope that all goes smoothly and we get you on the job very 
quickly.
    Thank you.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Merkley.
    Ms. Kvien?

 STATEMENT OF KRISTINA A. KVIEN OF CALIFORNIA, A CAREER MEMBER 
  OF THE SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-COUNSELOR, 
NOMINATED TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF 
    THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

    Ms. Kvien. Thank you, Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member 
Risch, and distinguished members of the committee for the 
opportunity to appear before you today.
    I am honored to be President Biden's nominee for the 
position of Ambassador to the Republic of Armenia and I am 
grateful for the trust and confidence the President and 
Secretary Blinken have placed in me.
    If confirmed, I commit to working closely with this 
committee and all members of Congress to advance U.S. interests 
in Armenia.
    I am a career Foreign Service officer with 30 years of 
experience. Most of my career has focused on Europe, guided by 
my conviction that a Europe whole, free, and at peace is in the 
best interests of the United States.
    Our successes in Europe since the breakup of the Soviet 
Union have created more stable and capable allies and partners, 
opened markets for U.S. goods and, ultimately, protected and 
defended the people of the United States.
    I am proud to have played a role in advancing U.S. 
strategic interests in Europe for over five administrations. I 
appreciate the leadership of the members of this committee and 
your work across Europe to resolve conflicts and support 
reforms in young democracies.
    I know firsthand that bipartisan support at home puts the 
United States in the strongest position to advance U.S. 
interests abroad.
    My recent diplomatic experience in Ukraine has only 
reinforced for me the importance of supporting the right of 
every country to choose its own path, forge its own alliances, 
and defend its own economic and political interests in line 
with the desires and aspirations of its people.
    If confirmed, I pledge to work with you to strengthen 
Armenia's democracy, security, and economy or, in a word, its 
sovereignty.
    If confirmed, I would prioritize the safety and security of 
American citizens and our talented embassy team and their 
families. I would also continue the efforts of my distinguished 
predecessor, Ambassador Lynne Tracy, to support Armenia's anti-
corruption initiatives, civil society, independent media, 
business development, regional integration, and efforts to 
counter malign influence.
    I would work with Armenians to help foster an impartial 
independent judiciary and to safeguard respect for freedom of 
expression.
    In doing so, I would focus on ensuring that U.S. taxpayer 
money is spent effectively in support of U.S. goals and 
objectives.
    The peaceful settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict 
is essential to a more secure and prosperous future for Armenia 
and for the South Caucasus.
    The United States is working through bilateral and 
multilateral channels to help the sides achieve a peaceful, 
lasting negotiated settlement of the conflict based on the 
principles of the U.N. Charter and the Helsinki Final Act.
    If confirmed, I will support the Administration's 
commitment to achieving this goal.
    I grew up in Fresno, California, home to one of the largest 
Armenian diaspora communities in the United States. My teachers 
and friends of Armenian heritage spoke of the Ottoman-era 
genocide that forced many of their families to seek new homes 
in America.
    As President Biden said on Armenian Remembrance Day this 
year, ``As we mourn the Meds Yeghern, let us redouble our 
efforts towards healing and building the better, more peaceful 
world that we wish for our children.''
    If confirmed, I commit to doing everything in my power to 
remember the victims of the Armenian genocide and support a 
peaceful future for Armenia. To this end, I will do all I can 
to encourage ongoing normalization discussions between Armenia 
and Turkey, which have made some step forward.
    I want to conclude by thanking those who have made it 
possible for me to be here today. I am joined by my husband, 
Tom White, who has been my partner through 13 moves and eight 
countries, and my daughter, Hanna White, who is applying what 
she learned in her overseas experiences as a high school 
teacher here in the District of Columbia.
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the committee, 
thank you again for this opportunity to appear before you 
today. I welcome your questions.

STATEMENT OF CAROL SPAHN OF MARYLAND, NOMINATED TO BE DIRECTOR 
                       OF THE PEACE CORPS

    Ms. Spahn. Thank you, Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member 
Risch, and distinguished members of the committee. I would also 
like to thank you for your kind words and support of Peace 
Corps and Peace Corps reauthorization legislation, and a 
special note of thanks to Senators Van Hollen and Merkley for 
their very kind remarks and support of Peace Corps.
    I would also like to thank my husband, Andy, who is here 
with me today, my daughters, Emily and Casey, my parents, Ralph 
and Janet, my very large, extended family for their unwavering 
love and support, and to my Peace Corps family, including the 
staff, volunteers, host families, and counterparts for the 
heart and soul with which they carry out our mission every day.
    I am deeply honored and humbled to appear before you today 
as President Biden's nominee for Director of the Peace Corps at 
this very unique point in the agency's history.
    Having started my career in the public sector, I am also 
incredibly grateful for the opportunity I had to serve as a 
small business development volunteer along with my husband, 
Andy, in Romania shortly after the fall of communism.
    As is true for many volunteers, my Peace Corps service 
challenged my perceptions, expanded my worldview, and 
fundamentally transformed my life. Living and working alongside 
Romanians during their pivotal transition to democracy gave me 
a deep appreciation for the power of human connection and the 
importance of engaging across difference with intention, 
humility, and respect.
    I carried this understanding with me as I took on various 
leadership roles at nonprofit organizations dedicated to 
supporting underserved communities around the world.
    In 2014, I returned to the Peace Corps, first serving as 
the Country Director in Malawi for five years, then as the 
Chief of Operations for the Africa region and Chief Executive 
Officer, and now as an expert consultant. It has been an 
incredible journey.
    But my service journey is not unique. We see time and again 
Peace Corps service extends well beyond a two-year commitment. 
It fosters a lifetime of global connection and national 
service.
    In the presence of volunteers in the furthest reaches of 
other countries speaking foreign languages and honoring 
cultures has an impact that goes far beyond the individual 
contributions of any one volunteer.
    I have had the distinct privilege of hearing from foreign 
ambassadors, ministers, and local leaders who tell me what a 
powerful signal of friendship it is to see Americans living in 
rural communities and working side by side with the people of 
their country, and American ambassadors regularly attest that 
the Peace Corps is the most cost-effective grassroots diplomacy 
that the United States has to offer.
    The Peace Corps' mission of world peace and friendship is 
more important now than ever. Not only are we just beginning to 
recover from an unprecedented global pandemic, but we are also 
reeling from the impacts of a global food crisis, climate 
change, and growing political and social division.
    As the world confronts these compounding crises, demand for 
the Peace Corps has grown, both from the countries we evacuated 
in 2020 as well as a growing list of countries requesting Peace 
Corps' support today.
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the committee, 
if confirmed as Director, my first priority is to safely return 
Peace Corps volunteers to service abroad and I will do so in a 
way that helps us to maintain the flexibility necessary to 
navigate uncertainty and respond effectively to evolving needs.
    Second, if confirmed, I will ensure that the Peace Corps 
remains a strong partner to communities and countries that 
request our support. This includes building on our long 
commitment to localization and people-centered development 
while modernizing and expanding service opportunities so that 
more Americans have the opportunity to serve.
    Third, if confirmed, I will prioritize youth engagement. 
Today, there are 1.8 billion people between the ages of 10 and 
24, the largest generation of youth in history, many of whom 
live in developing countries.
    This is not a problem to be solved. It is an opportunity to 
be met. In partnership, we will contribute to the next 
generation of global leaders and change makers, a critical 
investment for a secure, sustainable, and prosperous future.
    I would also like to, again, sincerely thank the committee, 
to thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, for your 
leadership on the Peace Corps Reauthorization Act. This 
legislation offers significant changes that will help us to 
further strengthen our ability to represent America abroad and 
to bring essential skills and understanding back to the United 
States.
    Thank you again for your support of the Peace Corps and for 
the opportunity to appear before you today. I look forward to 
your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Spahn follows:]


                  Prepared Statement of Carol A. Spahn

    Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Risch, and distinguished members 
of the committee, I am honored to appear today as President Biden's 
nominee to serve as Director of the Peace Corps during this unique 
moment in our agency's history.
    My journey here would not be possible without my family. I want to 
thank my husband, Andy; my daughters, Emily and Casey; my parents, 
Ralph and Janet; and my entire extended family for their unwavering 
love and support.
    I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity I had to serve as a 
Peace Corps volunteer with my husband in Romania shortly after the fall 
of communism. As is true for many volunteers, Peace Corps service 
challenged my perceptions, expanded my worldview, and fundamentally 
transformed my life. Living and working alongside Romanians during 
their pivotal transition to democracy gave me a deep appreciation for 
the importance of engaging across difference with intention, humility, 
and respect.
    Peace Corps service also altered my career path and led to 
leadership roles at organizations dedicated to supporting underserved 
communities around the world. In 2014, I returned to the Peace Corps, 
first serving as the Country Director in Malawi, then as the Chief of 
Operations for the Africa Region, and until last week, as the Chief 
Executive Officer.
    My journey is not unique. We see time and again that Peace Corps 
service extends well beyond a two-year commitment. It fosters a 
lifetime of global connection and national service. There are thousands 
of returned Peace Corps volunteers continuing to serve right here at 
home--in the foreign and civil service, non-profit, healthcare, 
education, and many more fields. The skills developed in the Peace 
Corps enable returned volunteers to contribute to America long after 
service overseas concludes.
    And, the presence of volunteers in the farthest reaches of 
countries, speaking local languages, and honoring local cultures has an 
impact that goes far beyond the individual contributions of any one 
volunteer. Foreign Ambassadors tell me what a powerful signal of 
friendship it is to see Americans in rural communities, working in 
close partnership with host country citizens, and American Ambassadors 
regularly attest that the Peace Corps is the most cost-effective, 
grassroots diplomacy the United States has.
    The Peace Corps' mission of promoting world peace and friendship is 
critical as we recover from the devastating effects of COVID-19. The 
pandemic has fundamentally changed our world and set back development 
progress. Its impact has been compounded by climate change, political 
and social division, and the global food crisis. At the same time, the 
pandemic has shown us how deeply connected we are. Demand for the Peace 
Corps remains strong, both from the countries we evacuated from in 2020 
as well as from a growing list of countries requesting volunteers.
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the committee, if 
confirmed as Director, my first priority is returning Peace Corps 
volunteers to service abroad, while maintaining the flexibility 
necessary to navigate uncertainty and respond effectively to countries' 
evolving needs. Over the past two years, we have strengthened our 
systems for volunteer safety and security, including for sexual assault 
prevention and response; expanded medical services, including mental 
health support; bolstered our technology infrastructure; and invested 
in developing a volunteer corps and staff that represents the full 
diversity of America.
    Second, if confirmed, I will ensure that the Peace Corps remains a 
strong partner around the world, retaining the critical components of 
our approach that drive long-term impact while modernizing and 
expanding service opportunities for the future. We will share our 
sixty-one years of expertise in localization and people-centered 
development and will leverage the robust network of returned 
volunteers, staff and host communities to build bridges and catalyze 
change both here and abroad.
    Third, if confirmed, I will prioritize youth engagement. Today, 
there are 1.8 billion young people between the ages of 10 and 24, the 
largest generation in history, approximately 90 percent of whom live in 
developing countries. This is not a problem to be solved; it is an 
opportunity to be met. Peace Corps volunteers are uniquely suited to 
work alongside youth on a range of development goals, from food 
security and disease prevention to gender equity and economic growth. 
Together, we will contribute to the development of the next generation 
of global leaders, a critical investment for a secure, sustainable, and 
prosperous future.
    Finally, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the 
committee, thank you for your leadership on the Peace Corps 
Reauthorization Act. This legislation will make a number of significant 
changes that will further strengthen the ability of the Peace Corps and 
its volunteers to represent America abroad and to bring those skills 
back to the United States.
    Thank you for your support of the Peace Corps, and for the 
opportunity to appear before you today. I look forward to your 
questions.


    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Ms. Dyer?

STATEMENT OF CYNTHIA DYER OF VIRGINIA, NOMINATED TO BE DIRECTOR 
OF THE OFFICE TO MONITOR AND COMBAT TRAFFICKING, WITH THE RANK 
                     OF AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE

    Ms. Dyer. Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Risch, 
distinguished senators, thank you for today's hearing to 
consider my nomination to be the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large to 
Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.
    I am honored by President Biden's nomination and the 
support of Secretary Blinken to lead the United States' global 
efforts to combat human trafficking.
    I want to thank my family, particularly my husband, Jason 
Ankele, whose support and sacrifice has allowed me to pursue a 
career which is also a passion. I am also thankful for my two 
children, Aubrey Scott and Evie Claire Ankele, who steadfastly 
provide me with enough joy and laughter to counter the 
sometimes heartbreaking challenges that are endemic to this 
work. And I am grateful for my late mother, Peggy Oswald, who 
would be so proud to see me sitting here today.
    I also want to recognize the team in the department's 
Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons who, thanks 
to sustained support from Congress, has been leading this cause 
for more than 20 years.
    If confirmed, I look forward to working closely with this 
committee and across the U.S. Congress to continue advancing 
this important work.
    I began my career more than 25 years ago as a prosecutor in 
the family violence unit in Dallas, Texas. For 13 years, I 
prosecuted cases at all levels, helping to bring justice to 
victims, including survivors of human trafficking, by holding 
offenders accountable.
    When I was later appointed in 2007 as director of the 
Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women, I led 
federal efforts to further strengthen our nation's capacity to 
address violence against women.
    And then, at Vital Voices Global Partnership, I 
collaborated with local governments and civil society 
organizations around the world to strengthen their capacities 
to respond to crimes and violence against women, including 
human trafficking.
    Throughout my work across the local, federal, and 
international levels, I have learned that successfully 
combating these crimes requires a sustained and comprehensive 
approach.
    In the early '90s when I first began prosecuting cases 
human trafficking was not recognized as a crime. We have come a 
long way since then, due in large part to the Trafficking 
Victims Protection Act of 2000 and the comprehensive framework 
it established to recognize human trafficking as a crime, hold 
traffickers accountable, and provide critical services to 
victims and survivors.
    If confirmed, I will prioritize maintaining the balanced 
and comprehensive approach the TIP office has carefully 
developed, focusing on the full spectrum of human trafficking 
and supporting efforts to prevent and respond to the crime by 
upholding international legal standards, addressing 
vulnerabilities that traffickers target, and integrating an 
equity-based approach throughout the TIP office's work.
    The role that survivors or those with lived experience of 
human trafficking can play in developing and informing anti-
trafficking efforts is critical and it will be among my highest 
priorities, if confirmed, to elevate their role and integrate 
their input even further.
    We need survivors at the table with us developing victim-
centered and trauma-informed solutions to combat sex 
trafficking and forced labor.
    If confirmed, I look forward to working closely with the 
U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking and the President's 
Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in 
Persons to ensure that we bring the full resources of the U.S. 
federal government to bear in the fight against human 
trafficking.
    The United States' global leadership on this issue is 
reflected nowhere clearer than the annual Trafficking in 
Persons Report, the world's most comprehensive resource on 
governmental anti-trafficking efforts and the U.S. Government's 
principal diplomatic tool to guide relations with foreign 
governments on human trafficking.
    If confirmed, I will strive to ensure the report remains 
objective and accurate and that tier rankings are based solely 
on a country's efforts to combat trafficking.
    The TIP office's targeted foreign assistance to build the 
capacity of governments and civil society and protect victims 
is integral to the department's holistic anti-trafficking 
approach.
    If confirmed, I will leverage the resources that Congress 
has entrusted to the TIP office to advance programming that is 
informed by the TIP Report and respond to emerging threats and 
opportunities.
    In the context of Russia's war on Ukraine, we have an 
opportunity and obligation to proactively address the threat of 
human trafficking by applying foreign assistance resources and 
urging governments to take steps to protect Ukrainian and third 
country nationals fleeing the war.
    Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, successfully 
combating human trafficking requires that we confront this 
crime aggressively.
    If confirmed, I will draw upon the many tools available at 
the TIP office--diplomacy, foreign assistance, robust 
interagency coordination--to prevent this crime from taking 
place, protect the victims, and prosecute the traffickers.
    Thank you for considering my nomination. I welcome your 
questions.

place, protect the victims, and prosecute the traffickers.
    Thank you for considering my nomination. I welcome your questions.


    The Chairman. Thank you all for your testimony.
    Before we start a round of five minutes of questions, I 
have questions that are on behalf of the committee as a whole 
and I simply need a yes or no answer to--by each of you to the 
following questions.
    These are questions that speak to the importance that this 
committee places on responsiveness by all officials in the 
executive branch within its purview.
    So the first question is do you agree to appear before this 
committee and make officials from your office available to the 
committee and designated staff when invited?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    The Chairman. Do you commit to keep this committee fully 
and currently informed about the activities under your purview?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    The Chairman. Do you commit to engaging in meaningful 
consultation while policies are being developed, not just 
providing notification after the fact?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    The Chairman. And, lastly, do you commit to promptly 
respond to requests for briefings and information requested by 
the committee and its designated staff?
    [All witnesses answer in the affirmative.]
    The Chairman. All right.
    So, for the record, since not everybody had their 
microphone on, let me just say that all of the nominees before 
the committee responded yes to each and every one of the 
questions.
    So we will start a series of five-minute rounds. Do not 
take the lack of members here as any negative fact that they 
are not concerned about your nominations or where you are 
headed. We have a lot of things going on. So there are 
different committees.
    Let me start with you, Ms. Fisher.
    Clearly, one of the challenges with Cyprus is that there 
has been an invasion and occupation that has lasted over four 
decades and that continues to be a challenge as we seek the 
reunification of the island under one nation bi-zonal bi-
communal federation.
    In our efforts to move towards that direction, I have--
believe that President Anastasiades has actually leaned more 
forward than any other Cypriot president as it relates to 
making I will not say concessions but to trying to find a way 
forward to do so, and one of the things that frustrates me 
about the State Department is they call on all sides.
    But when one side is the aggressor as, in my view, 
Azerbaijan is with Armenia, or in one case as in the case of 
Cyprus where one side is making concessions and the other is 
not, it is a little frustrating to be called on all sides when, 
in fact, when there is clarity, clarity should be ultimately 
called now.
    So how do you view--especially with President Erdogan 
seeking to more aggressively take over Varosha, which is in 
violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, how do you see 
your role in pushing back on that reality as the United States 
Ambassador to Cyprus?
    Ms. Fisher. Mr. Chairman, thank you, and I want to start by 
recognizing your deep experience on these questions and I, 
truly, appear before you today with a tremendous amount of 
humility about how much experience exists on this committee on 
these issues and how much experience my predecessors--if I were 
to be confirmed, how many incredibly capable diplomats have 
been at work on this case over decades.
    I do not underestimate how difficult the challenges are in 
Cyprus. I do think it is a place where there is tremendous 
opportunity if we can focus our energies on those on the 
island, those who are paying the highest price for the 
divisions currently and those who will benefit the most from 
that comprehensive settlement agreement should it be reached.
    Mr. Chairman, what I hope to bring to this is the ability 
to create space and to bring a sense of urgency to this 
process. We talk about this, and I do not mean to cite it as if 
I am some robot reciting lines that must be said.
    But the key part of these talks is that they are Cypriot 
led and U.N. facilitated and so, first and foremost, that is 
where I would look. That is where I will look to find the way 
forward. I think timing is absolutely critical on these issues 
and my experience is that we have no time to waste.
    The lesson that I have learned directly in the last 15 
years, being in Georgia during the Russian invasion, being on 
the margins of this conflict as I worked from Lithuania, and as 
Belarus was supporting Russia's aggression against Ukraine, 
what I know is that seams in Europe create opportunities for 
our adversaries, particularly seams within the transatlantic 
family. And so I intend to bring a sense of urgency to this 
effort.
    The Chairman. I appreciate that. A sense of urgency is 
important because this conflict has lasted way too long, and I 
agree with you. I have been doing this 30 years.
    If Turkish and Greek Cypriots were allowed to engage with 
each other there would be a solution. The problem is that 
Ankara puts their thumb on the scale and does not allow Turkish 
Cypriots to find their own way, which ultimately means that 
they decide, at the end of the day.
    And so these are some of the things that I think we need to 
consider as we are trying to create a sense of urgency to a 
resolution.
    Let me ask you--I am a strong proponent, as is generated by 
legislation that I passed and signed into law, on the East Med, 
the cooperation between Cyprus, Greece, and Israel as part of 
the 3+1 format.
    We are looking forward to the first meeting of the 3+1 
inter-parliamentary group to discuss energy cooperation as well 
as other important issues with our allies and partners in the 
region.
    But I have been disappointed that there has not been more 
support for the format from the Administration. Now, that is 
beyond your pay grade so I am not holding you responsible for 
that.
    But I am just saying that I hope that the next ambassador 
to Cyprus is an advocate within the interagency process to say 
we got a tremendous opportunity here.
    I mean, what opportunities do you see for us to work with 
Cyprus and our partners in the Eastern Mediterranean to bolster 
European energy security, to create a bigger ally as it relates 
to other security, not energy security?
    I give credit to the Cypriots that they stopped the Russian 
ships from ports of call before the invasion--before the 
invasion--which is incredibly important.
    So what do you see as some of those opportunities?
    Ms. Fisher. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I find that these kinds of formats, when we find that they 
work, when we find meaningful discussions in them that, truly, 
we have the opportunity to expand those agendas significantly.
    You have cited the energy issues as sort of--and some of 
the Eastern Med security as central questions for the 3+1 as it 
is getting started.
    My experience has been when we find a format where there is 
so much to share and so much to learn amongst a group of like-
minded partners that, truly, we can expand this in a multitude 
of directions.
    I am a--I have found these kinds of formats incredibly 
meaningful to building bilateral relationships. You can count 
on my support for this.
    I would also say, Mr. Chairman, that the inter-
parliamentary efforts--again, I will lean on my most recent 
experience--that the inter-parliamentary efforts to counter 
authoritarians in Russia and Belarus, the efforts of you and 
your counterparts and other parliaments in Europe are 
incredibly meaningful. They are quick, they are responsive to 
situations, and if you will allow me, it is an issue on which I 
would very much welcome the opportunity to continue to work 
with you and your team.
    The Chairman. All right. Thank you.
    I have many other questions for the panel but I will turn 
to Senator Van Hollen now.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Congratulations, again, to all of you on your nominations 
and, Ms. Kvien, if I could start with you.
    We had--as you know, our current nominee to be Ambassador 
to Russia has just formally been or is currently our Ambassador 
to Armenia and I just want to underscore some of the comments 
that Chairman Menendez made at that time, and I am not even 
going to ask a question of you at this point in time on this 
topic.
    But I do think that in order to be a credible party to any 
kind of negotiations we have to call out aggression when we see 
it, and it was very well documented in September by independent 
press sources that Azerbaijan launched attacks and also engaged 
in different kinds of atrocities.
    And we had a panel of representatives from the State 
Department a couple weeks ago, I think, Mr. Chairman, and some 
of us pressed on this very fundamental factual question, has 
the United States made a determination about who was the 
aggressor and have we made it clear that we agree with all the 
independent analyses that it was Azerbaijan, and we could not 
get a response.
    I understand the importance of being a mediator. But in 
order to be a credible mediator, in my view, you have got to at 
least begin with the facts and be willing to publicly state 
them.
    So you will be heading off to a very important country in a 
very conflicted part of the world, and I hope you will be 
willing to call out the facts as you see them.
    Ambassador Fisher, great to see you and congratulations 
again, and thank you for bringing the report I drafted as a 
staff member back in, I think, 1988 entitled--I think it was 
``New Opportunities for U.S. Policy in the Eastern 
Mediterranean.''
    Some things do not change. I still think there are 
opportunities but I think opportunities, again, will only make 
themselves happen and even then difficultly if we are willing 
to put pressure on different parties here.
    And I think you have followed probably very closely 
statements that Erdogan has made and actions he has taken. A 
little over a year ago he went to Cyprus. He talked about 
redeveloping Varosha, which, as you know, is a violation of 
various U.N. Security Council resolutions. And he was very 
brazen about how he said he did not care what others said, and 
he will not care as long as no action is taken.
    And so Senator Menendez and I actually drafted a letter at 
the time urging the Biden administration to work with our EU 
partners to make it clear in advance that those kind of actions 
will be met by some form of sanctions, that there is some 
penalty, some price, to be paid.
    And if there is not someone like Erdogan will keep on doing 
what he is doing. He may do it anyway. But he will, certainly, 
do it if there is no price to be paid.
    So as you head off on this assignment, if confirmed, and I 
expect you will, can you just talk a little bit about your role 
in the interagency process? Because whether it is Armenia and 
related to Azerbaijan and other issues in the region or whether 
it is Cyprus, Turkey, Greece, Eastern Med, you are there.
    We have a very good bilateral relationship now with the 
Republic of Cyprus and, obviously, your first assignment is to 
make sure we have strong bilateral relations with the Republic 
of Cyprus.
    But beyond that, some of these bigger issues that I know 
you want to try to challenge--you will get the Nobel Peace 
Prize if you do--but, seriously, you--on some of these issues 
we have got to be willing to push and that means you are going 
to have to be a voice in the interagency process to push the 
Administration.
    So I just--I want to know if that is something you have 
done previously and whether that is something you are committed 
to doing in this case.
    Ms. Fisher. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.
    And the report is--it, truly, is a wonderful reminder, and 
I am going to keep it with me. I might ask you to sign it 
before I leave because it really is a reminder about how many 
times we have seen opportunity only to be disappointed and how 
many people have wanted to help bring about that comprehensive 
settlement and have worked so hard--how many Americans have 
worked in support of that over decades.
    And so I was--it really was actually a wonderful find and I 
appreciate it. Thank you.
    Let me say, and I will--when it comes to the interagency 
process this is a particular skill set that I believe every 
nominee the State Department sends to you sits here with scars 
and scar tissue from that process. It has often been compared 
to a rugby scrum. I am not sure if that is sufficiently 
violent.
    But it is--a big part of our job is to be prepared to make 
the case and I think every American ambassador, every chief of 
mission, is committed to giving the best possible advice to the 
interagency that they possibly can and that means, in many 
cases, long nights due to time changes and time zones and these 
kinds of questions.
    I am absolutely committed to ensuring that the interagency 
has the full picture of what is happening in Cyprus just as I 
am committed to working with EU colleagues and others to ensure 
that there are consequences to actions.
    And I hope that from my record, particularly in my most 
recent position as Special Envoy to Belarus, that the committee 
can have confidence that I will not shy away from difficult 
issues, particularly when they involve international law, 
particularly when they involve human rights and fundamental 
freedoms--that these are of paramount importance.
    Senator Van Hollen. I appreciate that, and President Biden 
at one point sat right there where Chairman Menendez is and I 
recall him many times talking about justice on Cyprus and 
needing to push harder.
    I think if you can be a strong voice in the interagency 
process so it can reach the President's ears that you will have 
a willing partner in the President.
    Mr. Chairman, can I ask one question of the nominee?
    Ms. Spahn, congratulations again, and if you could just 
give us an update, and I apologize if you already did it. I 
mean, obviously, during COVID we had to bring everybody home--
just about everybody, if not everybody--and I mentioned in my 
remarks on your behalf that you had helped deploy many of those 
here at home to fight COVID.
    Where are we now in returning the Peace Corps personnel to 
countries around the world?
    Ms. Spahn. Thank you for that question. It has been a 
journey. We did evacuate all volunteers--almost 7,000 
volunteers in eight days amidst the closing of borders and 
cancellation of flights, which was a real testament to the 
relationships that Peace Corps has on the ground and our 
ability to move quickly in times of emergency.
    We currently have volunteers in 45 countries. We are 
inviting volunteers back to 56 countries and we have around 900 
volunteers in the field right now. We are building up gradually 
and very intentionally as we test our safety and security 
protocols both for the volunteers and for the communities that 
they serve.
    This is an evolving picture as we move from pandemic to 
endemic here in the United States. The picture is very 
different in every country around the world. So we have very 
strong systems in place to monitor those conditions.
    I was just in the Philippines where they just lifted the 
mask mandate outdoors. So our teams there have been supporting 
COVID vaccination efforts and moves towards normalcy. But we 
are very aware that different countries have different health 
care systems and different abilities to respond should there be 
another wave that comes along.
    So, I have tremendous confidence in the protocols that we 
have put in place and we will begin deploying more rapidly 
after those first groups go back.
    Senator Van Hollen. Great. I am looking forward to that. 
Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Let me return to Ms. Fisher--Ambassador Fisher--just on a 
couple of things.
    One is I was pleased to see the Department of State lift 
defense trade restrictions on the Republic of Cyprus in 
accordance with the Eastern Mediterranean Security and 
Partnership Act that Senator Rubio and I passed.
    I am also proud to see that after my recommendation the New 
Jersey National Guard has been selected as a new State partner 
for the Republic of Cyprus.
    Can I get your commitment to build on this progress to 
further strengthen the security partnership between the United 
States and Cyprus?
    Ms. Fisher. Mr. Chairman, absolutely.
    The Chairman. Both Senator Van Hollen and I have mentioned 
Varosha. Turkish activity in occupied Varosha including the 
opening of beaches violates U.N. Security Council Resolutions 
550 and 789. It is unacceptable.
    This is an example of a unilateral action that I was 
referring to, that when you have a unilateral action you cannot 
tell both sides to, ultimately, be better when only one side 
that has occupied Varosha is violating U.N. Security Council 
resolutions. It threatens the ability to achieve the goal of a 
bi-zonal bi-communal federation.
    If confirmed, can I get your commitment to push back 
against Turkish violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions 
regarding Varosha?
    Ms. Fisher. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
    The Chairman. I am pleased to see the U.N. extended the 
U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus through January of 2023. I do 
not know if you have ever visited Cyprus or not.
    But if you have not, when you go you will see the--what we 
call the Green Line, the dividing line between the occupied 
part of Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus. It is a rather 
impressive--impressive not in the positive sense, in the 
consequential sense.
    And Turkey's continued occupation and unauthorized 
activities in what is called the buffer zone, the zone between 
the areas where the Green Line is, is a threat to peace in the 
area.
    I hope we--I have spoken to our U.N. ambassador and--Linda 
Thomas-Greenfield. Appreciate that she got this extended to 
2023. These are short-term extensions. They do not really solve 
the ultimate problem.
    But will you commit to pushing for an extension of the U.N. 
peacekeeping force as long as we have this division at the 
Green Line?
    Ms. Fisher. Mr. Chairman, this peacekeeping force is 
absolutely playing an essential role--a stabilizing role. So 
yes, sir, you have my commitment.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Ms. Kvien, since Azerbaijan's attack in Armenia in 
September we have seen reports of Azerbaijani forces shooting 
unarmed Armenians, executing Armenian soldiers, mutilating a 
female Armenian soldier.
    This reports--these reports, I should say--reflect a long 
history of alleged Azerbaijani war crimes, including during the 
2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war.
    Would you commit, if you are confirmed, to leading embassy 
efforts to support the documentation of alleged atrocities 
committed against Armenians during this recent aggression?
    Ms. Kvien. Thank you, Senator.
    Yes, I have seen some of the horrific videos coming out 
recently of September and I would do my best to help with any 
requests the Armenians have to document.
    The Chairman. Okay. I do not want requests from Armenians. 
I want us to be proactive so we could make a determination.
    Something called Section 907 that we waive--under the 
Secretary's ability to waive that lets us send money to 
Azerbaijan. But we should know whether the Azerbaijanis are 
committing these types of actions so that we can make a 
determination whether that Section 907 should be waived or not 
of the Freedom Support Act.
    So I want an ambassador who is going to proactively help us 
determine whether these executions, whether these mutilations, 
whether these other activities, are true or not and to be able 
to tell the State Department and this committee that, in fact, 
they are, they are not, some of them are, some of them are not, 
so that then we, as policymakers, can make a decision.
    Can I depend upon you to do that?
    Ms. Kvien. Yes, Senator, and I can go further to say that 
accountability for crimes of this nature are very important to 
me and I will work to make sure that there is accountability as 
well.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    I am glad to see a nominee who actually calls the Armenian 
genocide genocide. I have actually in the past, unfortunately, 
been in the position of having to stop nominees because they 
will not consider the genocide a genocide. Genocide is 
genocide, at the end of the day. So I am glad to hear in your 
remarks you refer to the genocide.
    I am also deeply concerned that neither USAID nor the State 
Department has provided the humanitarian assistance necessary 
to meet the needs of almost 100,000 people displaced by the 
Nagorno-Karabakh war of 2020 or the current needs of the people 
who still reside in the region.
    If confirmed, would you commit to lead a need assessment or 
to advocate for a needs assessment? At least we should know 
what the needs are. We may not be the only suppliers of the 
response to those needs. It might be some type of donors 
conference.
    But we need to know what the needs are, at the end of the 
day. Will you support such a needs assessment with embassy--
within the embassy?
    Ms. Kvien. Yes, Senator, I would.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    Ms. Spahn, we have talked a little bit about some of what 
is to come. But why do you not tell us what your priorities 
will be for the agency?
    How will you work to address the lost development gains due 
to COVID-19, of course, including the increasing threat of 
climate change, dire humanitarian need in many parts of the 
globe, including as a result of Putin's ruthless aggression 
towards Ukraine that has affected global--some global food 
supplies? Talk to me a little bit about what your priorities 
would be.
    Ms. Spahn. Thank you. That is a very big question. In 
today's climate, there is a lot to address.
    Peace Corps, as you well know, goes into countries at the 
invitation of governments and works closely with them on their 
national priorities at the community level.
    There is tremendous value in Peace Corps' presence 
overseas. It is well beyond the work of the volunteers. It has 
symbolic presence as well.
    As I said in my opening statement, we have expressions of 
interest, letters of invitation, from 10 new countries around 
the world, including several countries in the Pacific.
    It is my intention to work very closely with those 
countries to assess their capacity and their ability to meet 
our safety and security--health, safety, and security 
conditions so that we can expand Peace Corps' presence in the 
Pacific, in Central America, and in other countries around the 
world.
    It is also a priority that we make Peace Corps service an 
option for a broader range of people within the United States. 
We are doing significant outreach into underrepresented 
communities, and we are looking at expanding beyond just recent 
graduates.
    We are looking at the great resignation. We are looking at 
quiet quitting. We are looking to engage, whether it is a 
farmer in Iowa or a recent graduate in New Mexico, a 
businessperson in the Bronx, to give people the opportunity to 
serve and to be a part of this amazing enterprise.
    The Chairman. And in this regard can you tell me what are 
your goals for restarting missions, and to the extent you have 
had those 10 invitations by countries how will you prioritize 
which countries you will send volunteers back to first?
    Ms. Spahn. So, we're returning volunteers first to the 
countries that we departed. So, we have invitations out to 56 
countries. We have several that are facing non-COVID threats, 
places like the Ukraine, Moldova, Ethiopia, and others that we 
are looking at the safety and security situation in those 
countries to evaluate if and when we can go back into those 
countries.
    As we look at new country invitations, we look holistically 
at the fit between the needs of the country and our ability to 
meet those needs; as well as the health, safety, and security 
considerations of those environments.
    The Chairman. And, finally, obviously, we care about the 
safety of volunteers--Peace Corps volunteers--they are our 
fellow Americans--as we would care about the safety and 
security of anybody at an embassy.
    How will you work to ensure that sites selected for 
volunteer placement are safe for volunteers? How will you judge 
where there is maybe active conflict zones and can I get your 
commitment that you will consult with me and my staff on 
oversight efforts with respect to reentry specifically in 
conflict areas?
    Ms. Spahn. So, first, to answer your last question, yes, 
you have my commitment to work with you and your teams.
    We do have security personnel in every country. They liaise 
very closely with the embassy and the RSO at the embassy to 
monitor the conditions in that country in different regions of 
that country.
    We also have regional security staff and a team at 
headquarters that are monitoring events. We know that there 
is--there are active conflict zones in a number of countries 
where we have traditionally had operations and we do not send 
volunteers back into those countries without doing an on-the-
ground assessment and without the collaboration and support of 
the embassy.
    The Chairman. Very good.
    Ms. Spahn. With respect to specific sites, I can say that 
those are also carefully monitored and selected with a set of 
criteria that are standard across all of our countries.
    The Chairman. Ms. Dyer, many victims of human trafficking 
are migrant domestic workers. Millions of women from South 
Asia, Africa, and elsewhere leave their homes in pursuit of 
decent work to provide for their families.
    Instead, many of these migrant women find themselves in 
conditions that amount to forced labor and experience 
extraordinary abuse, sometimes sexual abuse as well.
    What do you believe is the role of the Office to Monitor 
and Combat Trafficking in Persons, or JTIP as we refer to, in 
coordinating U.S. Government efforts to address the rights of 
vulnerable domestic workers and the underlying root causes that 
make these migrant women particularly vulnerable to forced 
labor, debt bondage, and other forms of human trafficking?
    Ms. Dyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that really 
thoughtful question, and I share your concern.
    One of the things that I observed during my years of 
working in trafficking is that domestic servants are uniquely 
vulnerable because they are so very isolated. They are 
frequently reliant on the owner of the home to give them care, 
to even let them out, and they do not have access sometimes to 
even some of the services or access to know that those services 
are available. So I share your concern.
    If I am confirmed, I would work closely to be sure that the 
Trafficking in Persons Report, which is our gold standard and 
our chief diplomatic and diagnostic tool, addresses these 
issues that each country that has this issue, and most 
countries do, that it is called out.
    I, particularly, appreciate the fact that this is something 
that we have even in the United States and when we see it we 
need to call it out here, too.
    I would especially look forward to using the Trafficking in 
Persons Report to not only help us determine what conversations 
we need to be having with other countries but specifically 
focusing on some countries that have visa programs that make it 
particularly vulnerable for migrant women who are in domestic 
servitude.
    We know specifically that the kafala system--that 
employment-based system--puts trafficking victims particularly 
at risk, makes them very--it makes it very challenging for them 
to even seek assistance or leave their home to go somewhere 
else because doing so puts them in violation of their visa.
    And I think that if I am confirmed that is definitely 
something that I would want to focus on and try to get some 
relief from.
    Thank you.
    The Chairman. I appreciate you recognizing the kafala 
system as one of our big challenges that we have.
    How sharp are your elbows?
    Ms. Dyer. You know what? I am currently working at the 
Department of Defense and the joke around the office is that I 
know when to be lapdog and I know when to be junkyard dog, and 
I just love junkyard dog days.
    And so if I am confirmed, I would look forward to being 
junkyard dog whenever it is necessary.
    The Chairman. I appreciate that, and here is the spirit in 
which I ask that question.
    There was a time--and I agree with you, the Trafficking in 
Persons Report is the gold standard globally to be able to call 
out countries in which human trafficking, sex exploitation, 
labor exploitation, and other things can be called out and then 
worked on in order--and have consequences.
    But that report is only as good as its integrity is, and we 
had a period of time in which the report really had political 
influences in which there were decisions that were made not on 
the merits of what the facts were but because we did not want 
to have country A, B, or C get upset.
    Well, then the trafficking report means nothing, especially 
when everybody knows that country A is doing all of these 
things but get put on a tier that does not suggest that they 
are violating, and country B, who may be in some respects less 
important to our national interest or security, ultimately gets 
the full wrath of the TIP report.
    We need to make sure that in the process of dealing with 
the regional bureaus and other entities as well as the 
embassies, who, obviously, are on the front line of dealing 
with these questions, we need to have a vigorous process that 
guarantees that the TIP Report is preserved in its integrity.
    It is what it is. Here is the law. Here are the facts. This 
should be on the list for whatever tier they should be. I hope 
we can count on you to do that.
    Ms. Dyer. Yes, sir. If I am confirmed, I would look forward 
to ensuring that the TIP Report maintains the focus on 
integrity, and I think that it is important not only from the 
U.S. because what is in the TIP Report determines what the 
United States does and what we are going to support.
    But it is also critically important--I know this from my 
work at a nonprofit--to the survivors and the civil society 
organizations that are working in the cracks and crevices of 
every country in the world.
    Our TIP Report speaks volumes for them because those 
survivors and those activists they can say, my country is not 
doing enough, and the country does not listen. But if the TIP 
Report that is issued by the United States of America says it, 
boy, does that speak volumes.
    And so we owe it not only for ourselves but for all of 
those activists and survivors out there who are relying on us. 
So I appreciate your interest. If I am confirmed, I can commit 
to focusing on that.
    The Chairman. I would like to be a golden retriever. Being 
a junkyard dog sometimes is necessary.
    [Laughter.]
    The Chairman. Lastly, there has been a--since 2015 there 
has been a reported 45 percent drop in global prosecutions. We 
know that prosecutions for forced labor and other forms of 
labor trafficking remain particularly low.
    How can you as Ambassador-at-Large at JTIP increase 
attention and resources to combating forced labor and other 
forms of labor trafficking, which is very important to us as 
well?
    We can--we will compete against anybody in the world. But 
if you are having your work done through labor trafficking, not 
only is it uncompetitive but it is humanly wrong to the 
individuals being labor trafficked.
    Ms. Dyer. Thank you so much for that--really, that very 
thoughtful question and as a former prosecutor I love your 
focus on accountability. Thank you so much.
    And I think that that is really important and particularly 
in the forced labor sphere. I think one thing--if I am 
confirmed, I would look forward to participating in the Forced 
Labor Enforcement Task Force in addition to the President's 
interagency task force and the Senior Policy Operating Group.
    But I think that that Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force 
is a great opportunity for us to have greater interagency 
support because I do believe that particularly in the forced 
labor sphere that the State Department needs to work hand in 
hand with the Department of Labor and Department of Homeland 
Security.
    And I think that, if I am confirmed, I would look forward 
to the opportunity to really increasing that level of 
cooperation and presenting a united front.
    The Chairman. Very good.
    Senator Van Hollen, I see you stayed. I just want to make 
sure you do not have anything else.
    All right. I think we have covered a good part of the 
waterfront here.
    So with the thanks of the committee for your appearance and 
your responses, we will have questions for the record. We urge 
you to respond to it expeditiously and fully because we often 
get members who feel their questions have not been answered 
except for one or two lines and then they will not agree to 
move the nominee forward.
    So if you can address it expeditiously and fully so that we 
can promote your names for a business meeting in which we can 
vote you out and send you to the floor.
    This record for the hearing will remain open until the 
close of business on Thursday, December 1st. Please ensure that 
questions for the record are submitted no later than Thursday.
    With the thanks of the committee, this hearing is 
adjourned.


    [Whereupon, at 5:13 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]



                              ----------

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
           to Hon. Lynne M. Tracy by Senator Robert Menendez

    Question. How will you use your position and voice to help lift up 
LGBTQ people, and support civil society organizations advocating for 
their rights?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will maintain the United States' 
longstanding support for the protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in Russia, including for LGBTQI+ persons, and I will continue 
to demonstrate solidarity with brave activists and human rights 
defenders, including those who advocate for the human rights of LGBTQI+ 
persons in Russia. Russia's proposed expansion of the ban on 
information regarding LGBTQI+ issues is extremely concerning; I will 
not hesitate to speak out against this and other measures that limit 
the rights of LGBTQI+ persons in Russia, consistent with the 
President's memorandum directing all agencies engaged abroad to ensure 
that U.S. diplomacy promotes and protects the human rights of LGBTQI+ 
persons.

    Question. How will you support those fleeing Russia as a result of 
persecution based on their sexual orientation or gender identity?

    Answer. Russian Federation citizens fleeing persecution based on 
their LGBTQI+ identities can face an increased threat of violence, 
harassment, and discrimination. If confirmed, I commit to working with 
the Bureau of Population, Refugee, and Migration, the Department of 
Homeland Security, and other stakeholders to ensure that LGBTQI+ 
refugees and asylum seekers have equal access to protection and 
assistance consistent with the President's Memorandum on Advancing the 
Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons Around the World.
Religious Liberty
    Question. The Russian government often targets those with what it 
calls ``nontraditional'' faiths with charges of ``extremism.'' Police 
in Russia have targeted Jehovah's Witnesses with home raids in cities 
nationwide, in some cases torturing members of the community. Do you 
commit to use your platform to speak up for Jehovah's Witnesses and 
other persecuted religious groups if confirmed?

    Answer. Russia's continued targeting for repression of members of 
minority religious groups is deeply disturbing. If confirmed, I will 
work closely with the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious 
Freedom to continue to hold Russia accountable for violations of 
religious freedom including of Jehovah's Witnesses and other persecuted 
religious groups and will amplify the voices of those advocating for 
their human rights.
Three Tech Companies
    Question. Tech companies like Apple and Google removed the ``Smart 
Vote'' app from their app stores in September 2021, limiting the 
Russian opposition's ability to organize during the Duma elections that 
year. Apple and Google cited specific threats against their employees 
as the reason for complying with a Russian government order to remove 
the app, but the opposition remains dependent on these types of 
technology companies to get their message out.

   What role should our Ambassador to Russia, and the Department of 
        State, play in offering support to American technology 
        companies to help them stand up to authoritarian threats?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will support efforts to expand connectivity 
to an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable Internet that affords 
all people access to unfiltered and unbiased information. I will also 
support any measures that advocate for or assist U.S. technology 
companies working to stand against threats from the Russian government.

    Question. What role should our Ambassador to Russia, and the 
Department of State, play in encouraging these technology companies not 
to comply with the Putin regime's orders if such orders will have a 
detrimental impact on the Russian opposition, civil society, 
journalists, or other vulnerable groups?

    Answer. If confirmed as Ambassador, I will continue to work with 
civil society and the private sector to help amplify independent 
Russian voices and promote the free flow of information and respect for 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, both online and offline in 
Russia.
    The Administration will not hesitate to call out Russian efforts to 
stifle Internet freedom and freedom of expression, domestically in 
Russia and abroad. Private sector technology companies play a crucial 
role in supporting these efforts, and as Ambassador, I will not 
hesitate to engage on their behalf if companies see it as beneficial to 
their efforts in opposition to Putin's threats.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
            to Hon. Lynne M. Tracy by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. Many U.S. Missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. What is your 
understanding of morale throughout Mission Russia?

    Answer. Morale is good under the circumstances but requires 
sustained leadership attention. In addition to the challenges already 
posed by COVID-19, the Embassy continues to face staffing and other 
challenges as the result of Russian actions, including the Russian 
Government's decision last year to force the termination of the 
Embassy's local and third country staff. Embassy staff also face 
harassment and are often prevented from doing their work, including 
visiting U.S. citizens in Russian prisons. We also continue to face 
challenges staffing the Embassy given the ongoing impasse with the 
Russians on diplomatic visas.

    Question. Many U.S. Missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. How do you intend to 
improve morale at Mission Russia?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work closely with the Embassy team at 
all levels and Washington to maintain morale and strengthen our 
Mission's operations, and I will engage the Russian Government to 
protest its actions against the Mission. Where possible, I will seek 
practical solutions to enable the Mission to continue is important 
diplomatic work.

    Question. Many U.S. Missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID. How do you intend to 
create a unified Mission and vision at Mission Russia?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to ensuring open and 
continuous communication at Embassy Moscow. We are all one team working 
together to pursue U.S. interests, so I will ensure this collaborative 
service focus is central to our work. Furthermore, I am committed to 
supporting a diverse and inclusive workforce. Diversity makes the 
Embassy stronger by bringing different perspectives and enhancing 
creativity. If confirmed, I look forward to working with the team to 
maximize innovation and effectiveness.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I believe it is important to maintain an open door to all 
members of the Mission team and encourage a supportive environment for 
the free flow of views. Although I am ultimately responsible for the 
Embassy as Chief of Mission, I believe the success of the Mission in 
advancing U.S. interests requires the effort of the entire team.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to berate 
subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No, it is never acceptable or constructive to berate 
subordinates, either in public or private.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How do you envision your leadership relationship with your Deputy Chief 
of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to a close and productive 
relationship with the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) and will work 
closely with the DCM to advance the U.S. Embassy's diplomatic and 
consular work.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you intend to entrust 
to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. Having been the Deputy Chief of Mission in Moscow, I know 
how important this role is. If confirmed, I will entrust the Deputy 
Chief of Mission with responsibility for the day-to-day operations of 
the Embassy. I will consult closely with the Deputy Chief of Mission on 
a range of issues to advance the diplomatic and consular work of our 
team at post and will remain engaged on key operational issues.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking. Do 
you believe that it is important to provide employees with accurate, 
constructive feedback on their performances in order to encourage 
improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their roles?

    Answer. Yes, I believe it is important to provide employees with 
accurate, constructive feedback on their performance to encourage 
improvement and reward those who most succeed in their roles. If 
confirmed, I will maintain an open-door policy to discuss constructive 
and timely feedback to enhance and lift the performance of the entire 
team.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking. If 
confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, accurate, and direct 
feedback to employees in order to improve performance and reward high 
achievers?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I would support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees to improve performance and 
reward high achievers.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Russia. In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our Embassy 
walls enough to accomplish fully their Missions?

    Answer. I firmly believe it is imperative that U.S. diplomats get 
outside of the Embassy to meet with local citizens, host government 
officials and representatives of non-governmental organizations. The 
Russians have severely curtailed Embassy Moscow's ability to travel and 
engage with others outside of the Embassy, but if confirmed, I will do 
my best to ensure we engage with local actors to the broadest extent 
possible.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Russia. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. diplomats to 
better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will engage the Russian Government to 
protest its restrictions on the Embassy and, where possible, seek 
practical solutions to enable Embassy staff to continue their important 
diplomatic work.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in 
Russia?

    Answer. Criticism of the West has increased dramatically since the 
Russian Government launched its full-scale invasion against Ukraine, 
and anti-West propaganda has also ramped up over the last 10 months. 
Propaganda, disinformation, and a more restricted internet has narrowed 
the information space and discourse in regard to the war but also more 
broadly in regard to free speech. That, combined with limited staffing 
at our Embassy, has necessitated more virtual programming and more 
creative avenues for engaging the Russian people, including via 
platforms like Telegram.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. The most obvious challenge to our public diplomacy efforts 
are Russia's foreign agent and censorship laws, which disincentivize 
Russian citizens from interacting with Embassy staff and even speaking 
their minds. Separately, freedom of movement is also a challenge to 
most Embassy staff, with the Russian Government placing limitations on 
staff travel.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country Mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. The Russian Government expends a lot of effort to discredit 
U.S. Government officials. First and foremost, it is key for us to 
deliver accurate, truthful information from credible sources. Second, 
we rely on the expertise of our public diplomacy section in Moscow and 
our Moscow Engagement Support Office in Riga to contextualize those 
messages and time their delivery to ensure that they are positioned to 
at least be heard by the Russian people and not dismissed out of hand.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel. If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat 
seriously?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed. There is nothing I will take more 
seriously than the health and security of the people who will be 
working with me.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Russia personnel?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I commit to sharing what information I 
can within the bounds of privacy and security concerns with Embassy 
Moscow personnel.

    Question. If confirmed, one of your primary responsibilities will 
be maintaining Embassy posture and ensuring the staff and facilities 
are functioning at the highest level possible. What is your familiarity 
with the state of Embassy Moscow's facilities?

    Answer. Embassy Moscow has faced numerous difficulties in 
sustaining its facilities due to the lack of personnel and the 
difficulty of shipping key equipment to Russia. If confirmed, I will 
work closely with my Embassy team and Washington to ensure that we do 
everything we can to overcome these constraints and ensure that we 
sustain this vital diplomatic platform.

    Question. If confirmed, one of your primary responsibilities will 
be maintaining Embassy posture and ensuring the staff and facilities 
are functioning at the highest level possible. What are your top 
priorities for the improvement and/or maintenance of the facilities at 
Embassy Moscow?

    Answer. If confirmed, one of my top priorities will be working 
together with Washington to ensure that we can get the human and 
material resources into Moscow that are necessary to ensure the safe 
and effective operation of our Embassy.

    Question. If confirmed, one of your primary responsibilities will 
be maintaining Embassy posture and ensuring the staff and facilities 
are functioning at the highest level possible. In the event that 
Embassy Moscow must be vacated, do you believe that the current Embassy 
posture could support a full and proper shutdown of the facility, 
including the destruction or removal of sensitive materials? If not, 
how will you implement a plan to prepare for such an eventuality?

    Answer. If confirmed, maintaining Embassy Moscow's ability to 
operate and fulfill its responsibilities will be one of my top 
priorities. At present, Embassy Moscow is not in a departure status and 
has sufficient staff to drawdown operations if necessary. If confirmed 
I will meet regularly with the Embassy's Emergency Action Committee to 
make contingency plans for evacuation and to ensure we have the 
personnel and resources necessary to support a full and proper shutdown 
of our facilities in Moscow should that be required.

    Question. There are number of Americans detained in Russia, some of 
whom have been labeled as wrongfully detained under the Levinson Act. 
How will you engage with the Russian Government to ensure detainees 
have proper consular access, as well as access to communication with 
their lawyers and family?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will press Russian authorities to adhere to 
their legal obligations to provide regular consular access to all U.S. 
citizens detained in Russia and ensure their health and welfare. I will 
also work with the Embassy team to provide support for the 
communication between the detained citizens and their families and 
lawyers. This will be one of my very highest priorities.

    Question. There are number of Americans detained in Russia, some of 
whom have been labeled as wrongfully detained under the Levinson Act. 
How do you envision the working relationship and organization of 
efforts between Embassy Moscow and SPEHA, the Bureau of Consular 
Affairs, and other State Department and interagency offices on the 
issue of detained Americans?

    Answer. The wrongful detention determination is a legal, fact-based 
review that looks at the totality of the circumstances for each case 
individually. The Department of State continuously monitors all cases 
for indications of a wrongful detention. If confirmed, I will work 
closely with SPEHA, the Bureau of Consular Affairs, and other 
Department and interagency offices in support of their efforts by 
providing regular and up-to-date information to aid the review of 
individual cases.

    Question. The administration's Iran policy has focused on a return 
to the nuclear deal (JCPOA) that would enrich Russian state-owned 
enterprises for nuclear material swaps, enrich Russia for continued 
work on the Bushehr reactor, and potentially provide Russia with an 
avenue to launder its oil and gas through Iran and into international 
markets. To what extent does the Administration's Iran policy make 
implementation of Russia policy more difficult or problematic?

    Answer. Our policies towards Russia and Iran are consistent. As we 
seek to isolate Russia, undermine its access to finance and technology 
for strategic sectors of its economy, and degrade its industrial 
capacity to support aggression for years to come, we are also exposing 
and countering Iran's contribution to that aggression. The United 
States is also working to expose and deter Iran's provision of weapons 
to Russia for use against the Ukrainian people. We will continue to 
vigorously enforce U.S. sanctions on both Russia and Iran.

    Question. The administration's Iran policy has focused on a return 
to the nuclear deal (JCPOA) that would enrich Russian state-owned 
enterprises for nuclear material swaps, enrich Russia for continued 
work on the Bushehr reactor, and potentially provide Russia with an 
avenue to launder its oil and gas through Iran and into international 
markets. Wouldn't a definitive stop to JCPOA negotiations bring Russia 
and Iran policies more into alignment?

    Answer. I am not privy to the current state of the JCPOA 
negotiations, but I can state that our policy is to isolate Russia and 
expose and counter Iran's role in contributing to Putin's aggression.
    The United States is also working to expose and deter Iran's 
provision of weapons to Russia for use against the Ukrainian people. If 
confirmed, I will continue to advocate vigorously for the enforcement 
of all U.S. sanctions against Russia.

    Question. The growing defense consortium between Iran and Russia is 
deeply problematic. Iran continues to provide armed drones to Russia 
that have been used on battlefields in Ukraine with great effect--
particularly targeting energy infrastructure. Worse, Iran has 
advertised that it will provide technical assistance to build these 
drones in Russia and has opened the door to the provision of short 
range ballistic missiles for Russia's war effort. How does the U.S. 
drive a wedge in the Russo-Iranian relationship?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will support all efforts to thwart Iran's 
provision of assistance to Russia's war and Moscow's use of these or 
any other military capabilities against the Ukrainian people. This 
includes sustained diplomatic efforts to bring multilateral pressure to 
bear on both Russia and Iran. The U.S. Government will continue to work 
to prevent such transfers from taking place and to use the full range 
of sanctions authorities and other accountability measures to impose 
costs on those involved.

    Question. The growing defense consortium between Iran and Russia is 
deeply problematic. Iran continues to provide armed drones to Russia 
that have been used on battlefields in Ukraine with great effect--
particularly targeting energy infrastructure. Worse, Iran has 
advertised that it will provide technical assistance to build these 
drones in Russia and has opened the door to the provision of short 
range ballistic missiles for Russia's war effort. What costs can the 
U.S. impose that would discourage continued Russo-Iranian cooperation?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will support all efforts to counter Iran's 
provision of assistance to Russia's war of aggression and Moscow's use 
of these or any other military capabilities against the Ukrainian 
people. This includes working with our partners and allies to identify 
entities and individuals for sanctions designations and other 
accountability measures.

    Question. There are many U.S. and allied-led efforts at and within 
the U.N. system to hold Russia accountable for its attack on Ukraine 
and subsequent war crimes. How can you bolster these efforts within the 
USG and the U.N.? Please be descriptive.

    Answer. We are supporting a range of international investigations 
into atrocities and other abuses in Ukraine. This includes those 
conducted by the International Criminal Court, the United Nations, and 
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The United 
States has further provided robust support for Ukrainian efforts to 
document and investigate Russia's atrocities in Ukraine, including by 
coordinating direct technical support to the Office of the Prosecutor 
General under the framework of the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group.
    If confirmed, I will ensure that we continue to work closely with 
our U.S. Mission to the United Nations and departments and agencies in 
Washington on efforts to hold Russia accountable, such as the 
overwhelming U.N. General Assembly vote condemning Russia's war against 
Ukraine. I will support efforts to censure and isolate Russia in 
relevant international bodies, as well as initiatives to hold Moscow 
accountable for the horrendous crimes being committed in Ukraine.

    Question. Do you believe that Russia is committing genocide in 
Ukraine? Why or why not?

    Answer. I cannot speak to any future assessment of whether specific 
acts constitute specific international crimes. But if confirmed, I will 
ensure that we are continuing to call out and document Russia's 
horrific abuses in Ukraine, including reports of conflict-related 
sexual violence. We know that words matter--as do actions. If 
confirmed, I will work to support all efforts to hold Russia to account 
for its terrible actions in Ukraine, including its horrendous human 
rights abuses, atrocities, and war crimes.

    Question. Do you believe current efforts by the U.S., allies, and 
partners in Europe to provide support for justice units in Ukraine are 
sufficient? Why or why not.

    Answer. Through the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group for Ukraine 
(ACA), the United States, the UK, and the EU are deploying the best 
subject-matter experts as mobile justice teams to support Ukraine's 
Office of the Prosecutor General in its investigation and prosecution 
of atrocity crimes. These specialists have decades of experience as war 
crimes investigators, international prosecutors, military analysts, and 
conflict-related sexual violence experts. As the demands on the 
domestic authorities in Ukraine grow, the ACA plans to establish more 
permanent field Missions to assist regional prosecutors working in 
other regions of the country. I believe continuing our efforts on 
accountability is critical, as the Ukrainian people deserve justice.

    Question. In the 2022 Trafficking in Persons report, Russia 
remained on tier 3 for its lack of effort to combat or monitor human 
trafficking. In your view, how can you best support civil society 
actors and fight government complicity in Russia regarding anti-
trafficking work?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue to advance the 
Administration's work to monitor and combat human trafficking, 
including by maintaining an unwavering commitment to hold Russia 
accountable to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act's minimum 
standards to combat human trafficking. I will also advocate strongly 
for continued robust U.S. support to civil society organizations in and 
out of Russia working to fight this scourge.

    Question. In the 2021 International Religious freedom report, 
Russia was listed as being wholly intolerant of religious freedom and 
making significant efforts to curb the rights of religious minorities. 
What, in your view, can be done to bolster religious freedom both 
inside Russia and in its spheres of influence globally?

    Answer. Russia's continued targeting for repression of members of 
minority religious groups is deeply disturbing. If confirmed, I will 
work closely with the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International 
Religious Freedom to expose and speak out against Russia's violations 
of religious freedom, as well as amplify the voices of those advocating 
for their human rights.

    Question. In the 2021 Human Rights Report, Russia was listed as 
committing and baring witness to countless human rights abuses both 
inside Russia and outside, particularly in Ukraine. How, if you 
confirmed, can you bolster human rights on the ground? What tools will 
you make available or use within your Mission to further the crumbling 
human rights of civil society in country?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will maintain the United States' 
longstanding support for the protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in Russia and for brave activists and human rights defenders. 
The Administration coordinates regularly with Allies and partners to 
demonstrate our shared solidarity with independent Russian civil 
society and media.

    Question. Negative attitudes towards the U.S. have increased among 
Russians. How do you intend to work with civil society given the 
restrictive environment in the country?

    Answer. The United States is a beacon of freedom in the world, 
including in Russia. If confirmed, I will speak out proudly in the 
advocacy of our principles and lend my support to human rights 
defenders, independent civil society, and objective media. I will 
continue to advocate for our sustained support of organizations that 
protect Russians resisting Putin's repression, organizations that work 
to provide independent news and political analysis to Russian audiences 
in Russia, and other civil society elements.

    Question. Negative attitudes towards the U.S. have increased among 
Russians. If confirmed, what form do you envision your engagement and 
outreach to public taking?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will pursue all opportunities to 
communicate with the Russian people to convey to them not only the 
truth about what their own government is doing, but also making clear 
that our issues and concerns are with Russia's Government, not its 
people.

    Question. Negative attitudes towards the U.S. have increased among 
Russians. Given the restrictive media and internet environment, where 
state-controlled television remains the main source of information 
across the country, what will you do to break through to the Russian 
people?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will use all available means to provide 
clear and effective messaging to the Russian people. The U.S. 
Department of State hosts a wide variety of content across social media 
platforms, some of which are accessible in Russia, such as Telegram and 
YouTube. Russian citizens also widely use VPNs and other tools to view 
restricted content.

    Question. Negative attitudes towards the U.S. have increased among 
Russians. How will you maintain dialogue between the U.S. and Russia to 
prevent misunderstandings or miscalculations?

    Answer. Even as we seek to isolate Russia and undermine diplomatic 
and economic support for its war effort, we are also working to 
maintain our Embassy's mission to provide consular assistance, preserve 
channels of communication, and pursue people-to-people exchanges. If 
confirmed, I will spare no effort to sustain essential channels of 
communication with Moscow.

    Question. Negative attitudes towards the U.S. have increased among 
Russians. What is your view of the possibility of removing Russia's 
permanent appointment to the U.N. Security Council? How to you think 
Russia would react to such an action?

    Answer. The current structure of the U.N. Security Council does not 
provide a ready means to remove a permanent member.

    Question. Negative attitudes towards the U.S. have increased among 
Russians. The Russian Government has previously conducted aggressive 
transnational repression activities abroad, including assassinations. 
How do you intend to raise U.S. concerns about this?

    Answer. Exposure and disruption of Russia's malign activities 
imposes a cost on the individuals and entities that engage in these 
efforts. Such actors include both government officials, namely in the 
Russian intelligence services, and unofficial proxies. Continuing to 
deter the most dangerous Russian hybrid threats is critical. The United 
States works with likeminded Allies and partners to counter Russian 
malign influence and activities through a variety of multilateral and 
bilateral avenues. If confirmed, I will continue to report back to 
Washington on these Russian malign activities to help inform the 
ongoing interagency efforts to counter them.

    Question. How do you envision coordination between the Embassy and 
the State Department, White House, and the rest of the interagency back 
in Washington?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will pursue close coordination in all 
available communication channels with the White House, the Department 
of State, and the rest of the interagency to ensure the Embassy's view 
is factored into policy decision-making as well as to address emerging 
challenges. If confirmed, I will be available to Washington 24 hours a 
day, seven days a week to support the interests of the U.S. Government 
and people.

    Question. Which issues will Embassy Moscow take a lead on? On which 
issues will the Embassy play a supporting role?

    Answer. If confirmed, the Embassy team and I will coordinate with 
Washington and other U.S. Missions in the field on all Russia-related 
matters. The U.S. Embassy remains at the forefront of U.S. engagement 
with Russians from all aspects of society and the Government in Russia. 
The Embassy will feed into policy decision-making and other activities 
in support of a whole-of-government approach to U.S. policy toward 
Russia.

    Question. Despite significant issues in the relationship, are there 
issues that the U.S. and Russia can cooperate on? If so, what are those 
issues, and what would cooperation look like?

    Answer. As you know, the United States continues to maintain a 
diplomatic presence in Moscow because it is important to continue to 
have a channel for bilateral dialogue. The Administration engages as 
appropriate on issues deemed critical to national security, including 
nuclear nonproliferation and arms control. The Administration also 
engages at multilateral institutions and in treaty-based organizations 
to ensure that we protect and advance U.S. interests in the U.N. and 
elsewhere and enforce U.S. rights under bilateral and multilateral 
treaties.

            to Hon. Lynne M. Tracy by Senator Jeanne Shaheen

    Question. How can the U.S. support democratic spaces in Russia, 
including free and independent media such as RFE/RL, to continue to try 
and convey the truth of what is happening in Ukraine to the Russian 
people?

    Answer. The Administration coordinates regularly with Allies and 
partners to support and demonstrate our shared solidarity with 
independent Russian civil society and media, as well as to use 
multilateral platforms to condemn and promote accountability for the 
Kremlin's abuses against human rights defenders. The United States also 
continues to support organizations, including Radio Free Europe/Radio 
Liberty, which provide independent news and political analysis, 
including about Russia's ongoing aggression against Ukraine, to Russian 
audiences.

    Question. More broadly, how will you advance the causes of Russia's 
pro-democracy activists and ensure continued U.S. support for the small 
but important democratic space in Russia that Putin and his cronies are 
working to quash?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will support and amplify the 
Administration's public condemnation of Russia's deepening repression, 
including against pro-democracy activists, independent voices, and 
civil society.
    I will maintain the United States' longstanding support for groups 
and individuals who work to protect human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in Russia. I also will coordinate closely with Allies and 
partners to demonstrate our shared solidarity with independent voices 
in Russia and promote accountability for the Kremlin's abuses and 
repression.

    Question. What additional efforts can the U.S. Government undertake 
to deter future Russian election interference, both in the U.S. and 
around the world?

    Answer. While the threat of foreign interference against our 
election infrastructure remains, our election systems are resilient. 
The Administration works on a whole-of-government basis--together with 
an integrated public-private coalition--to ensure the security of 
America's elections. This Administration has imposed sanctions on 
Russian actors for attempts at election interference. This includes 
multiple rounds of sanctions against Yevgeniy Prigozhin and Internet 
Research Agency-linked actors. We continue to denounce any attempt to 
influence or interfere in our electoral process and will continue to 
inflict serious consequences should Russia or its proxies attempt to 
influence or interfere in our electoral process again. If confirmed, I 
will continue to emphasize this point and support interagency efforts 
to hold Prigozhin and any other Russian malign actors accountable.

    Question. What do you assess to be the risks of Russian election 
interference and Russian-promoted election disinformation in Eastern 
Europe and sub-Saharan Africa, regions that have already experienced 
Russian meddling? How can the U.S. more effectively combat the 
international reach of Russian election interference?

    Answer. Russia continues to threaten nations around the world to 
achieve its political goals and remains committed to undermining 
democratic governments and processes through covert and overt means, 
including but not limited to election interference. By weakening 
election integrity, Russia hopes to shape foreign political 
environments in its own interests. The United States Government 
continues to focus on rebutting and countering Russian disinformation 
and exposing Russia's malign influence operations targeting democratic 
elections and institutions beyond. This includes through information 
sharing with Allies and partners and by working with partners to 
disrupt and impose sanctions against Russian entities and actors for 
attempts to influence elections, sow societal divisions, or erode trust 
of democratic societies and institutions.

    Question. Can I receive your commitment that, if confirmed, you 
will work to advance the cause of Vladimir Kara-Murza, and encourage 
the British Ambassador in Moscow to prioritize the release of Mr. Kara-
Murza, who is a British citizen?

    Answer. The United States regularly speaks out against the 
Kremlin's targeting of those who seek to defend human rights and 
exercise their fundamental freedoms in an increasingly repressive and 
authoritarian environment. Mr. Kara-Murza has been a particularly 
courageous proponent for a more democratic future for Russia. If 
confirmed, I commit to making it a top priority to coordinate with 
Allies and partners on messaging and advocacy for the release of Mr. 
Kara-Murza and the more than 400 other political prisoners Russia 
imprisons unjustly.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
             to Hon. Lynne M. Tracy by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. As we speak, the Party is 
cracking down on unprecedented student protests across the country. 
With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry, the CCP 
could stop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. The President made it clear in his National Security 
Strategy that the People's Republic of China (PRC) harbors the 
intention and, increasingly, the capacity to attempt to reshape the 
international order to its benefit. As Secretary Blinken said on May 
26, we will invest in America, align with our Allies and partners, and 
compete with the PRC to defend our interests and build our vision for 
the future.

    Question. Does the CCP undertake any activities that are beneficial 
to U.S. interests?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors with the PRC, as the 
President laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United States 
does not seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our Allies and 
partners have an opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in 
a way that influences their behavior even as we compete with them. The 
United States' approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the 
PRC where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them 
when they align.

    Question. Do you believe there are any areas within which the CCP 
would constructively work with the United States in good faith?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors, as the President 
laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United States does not 
seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our Allies and partners have an 
opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in a way that 
influences their behavior even as we compete with them. The United 
States' approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC 
where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them when 
they align.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China in 
the Russian Federation?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue our close work with 
likeminded Allies and partners to benefit the United States and advance 
our shared security, prosperity, and values. Given our opposing policy 
priorities and values, I do not foresee working with the People's 
Republic of China on any joint activities in Russia.

    Question. The United States, with NATO allies and other partners, 
are currently providing vital assistance to Ukraine as it defends 
itself against Vladimir Putin's unjustified and unprovoked invasion. 
The administration has levied broad sanctions on Russia's ability to 
wage war and requested $66 billion in supplemental funding for 
humanitarian and security assistance among other efforts. Ukraine's 
ability to repel Russian advances have been buoyed by the international 
community's assistance and their fierce sense of independence. This, in 
addition to European sanctions on Russia and assistance to Ukraine, has 
diminished Russia's standing on the global stage, exposed the Russian 
military's eroded capacity and capability, and caused the mass 
emigration of Russians to avoid military conscription. Throughout the 
conflict Russian officials have repeatedly hinted at the possibility of 
using nuclear weapons, while hardliners in Russia have even called for 
Russia to attack neighboring countries, including NATO members.

   What is your assessment of the likelihood of nuclear weapons use by 
        Russia in the current conflict?

    Answer. As President Biden has said repeatedly, any use of such 
weapons would be unacceptable and result in severe consequences. 
Putin's continued nuclear saber-rattling is highly irresponsible and 
destabilizing. In January 2022, Presidents Putin and Biden joined a 
statement by leaders of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security 
Council that affirmed the principle that ``a nuclear war cannot be won 
and must never be fought.'' We have pressed Russia to live up to that 
statement.

    Question. If confirmed, in your capacity as the primary American 
representative to Russia, what actions will you take to ensure the 
conflict in Ukraine does not evolve into a wider conflict between 
Russia and NATO?

    Answer. Since February, the Alliance has enhanced its defensive 
posture along the Eastern Flank and has plussed up the readiness of our 
forces. NATO also made a dramatic shift at the Madrid Summit last 
summer to move to a centralized, strengthened, and expanded NATO force 
posture and command structure, which it is now working to implement. 
This will strengthen our overall deterrence and defense.
    The Alliance is, and will be, even better equipped and more 
responsive to threats in the new security reality we find ourselves in.

    Question. In your opinion, how will mobilization affect Russia's 
ability to continue its war in Ukraine?

    Answer. Russia's partial mobilization shows that Russia is losing 
its war against Ukraine. It also has further negatively impacted 
Russia's economy and caused tens of thousands of Russians to flee the 
country. The United States will continue to support Ukraine to defend 
its independence and territorial integrity.

    Question. In your view, to what extent will mobilization motivate 
the general population against the war?

    Answer. Forced mobilization has caused newfound criticism by 
Russian elites over Putin's prosecution of the war, which could 
increase domestic opposition to the war given the now increased direct 
costs to average Russians. It has also resulted in tens of thousands of 
Russian men fleeing the country to avoid mobilization, which will have 
impacts on both society and the economy. However, Putin still controls 
the main levers of information and thus propaganda to present false 
narratives about the war against Ukraine.

    Question. What effect might popular dissatisfaction have on the 
Russian leadership's ability to continue to wage war?

    Answer. The dissatisfaction among some elites signals 
dissatisfaction at high levels with the reality that Russia is losing 
the war in Ukraine. The more money and resources that the Russian 
government spends, the more dissatisfied the population could become.

    Question. If confirmed, how will the American Embassy and 
consulates in Russia handle cases where Russian citizens apply for 
refuge in order to escape mobilization?

    Answer. We are not aware of requests for assistance of our Embassy 
by Russians seeking to depart Russia. We are aware of cases of Russian 
citizens fleeing to other countries in which they may be able to seek 
protection. Under U.S. law, asylum requests can only be made by a 
person who is physically present in or has arrived in the United 
States. Requests for asylum or refugee status are considered on a case-
by-case basis and in accordance with U.S. law.

    Question. What is your assessment of the effectiveness of the 
economic sanctions imposed by the international community on Russia and 
how can those sanctions be strengthened?

    Answer. Sanctions and export controls are having significant and 
long-lasting consequences on Russia's ability to wage war, in Ukraine 
and in the future. Since February 2022, the United States and our 
Allies and partners have coordinated to use export controls and 
sanctions to restrict Russia's access to financing, supplies and spare 
parts, and advanced technology, all of which have degraded Russia's 
ability to produce and stockpile weapons to replace those that have 
been destroyed in the war. The Administration continues to work with 
Allies and partners to develop options to tighten those sanctions while 
intensifying efforts to crack down on those attempting to evade our 
unprecedented sanctions.

    Question. If confirmed, representatives of the Russian government 
will approach you with requests to ease sanctions on specific 
industries, individuals, or sectors. What is your message to Russian 
Government officials?

    Answer. As long as the Kremlin continues its unprovoked and brutal 
war against Ukraine and its people, the United States will stand united 
with Allies and partners in imposing additional costs on Russia. We 
will continue to mobilize support for the tightening of restrictions on 
Russia until its stops its aggression and fully withdraws its troops 
from Ukraine's internationally-recognized borders. If confirmed as 
Ambassador, I will reinforce this message to Russian officials.

    Question. How do you assess the current state of the Russia's 
bilateral relationship with the CCP and their joint efforts to diminish 
international norms, human rights, and laws?

    Answer. Given Russia's failings on the battlefield in Ukraine, and 
the extensive sanctions that have been applied to segments of the 
Russian economy, Russia's relationship with the People's Republic of 
China seems to be increasingly tilted in the PRC's favor. It is likely 
Russia will continue working with the PRC to undermine the rules-based 
international order, as China is increasingly one of the few neighbors 
willing to engage with Russia at a time when it is most isolated.

    Question. If confirmed, what can be done to increase the Russian 
public's awareness of Russia's growing dependence on the CCP?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will continue to work with our public 
diplomacy staff, as well as likeminded Allies and partners, to message 
to the Russian people that Russia's relationship with the People's 
Republic of China is becoming increasingly unequal. We can draw on 
numerous examples from around the world which show the negative long-
term effects of such relationships with the People's Republic of China.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
            to Hon. Lynne M. Tracy by Senator John Barrasso

    Question. Is it the position of the United States that Russia and 
President Putin committed war crimes in Ukraine?

    Answer. The Secretary has stated that the U.S. Government assesses 
that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.

    Question. What efforts is the United States taking to help document 
the war crimes being committed by Russia in Ukraine?

    Answer. The United States is fully committed to ensuring 
accountability for all those responsible for Russia's atrocities and 
abuses in Ukraine. We are supporting a range of international 
investigations into atrocities and other abuses in Ukraine. This 
includes those conducted by the International Criminal Court, the 
United Nations, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe. The United States has further provided robust support for 
Ukrainian efforts to document and investigate Russia's atrocities in 
Ukraine, including by coordinating direct technical support to the 
Office of the Prosecutor General under the framework of the Atrocity 
Crimes Advisory Group.

    Question. What is the current state of operations of the U.S. 
Embassy and Consulates in Russia?

    Answer. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow remains our sole operating 
diplomatic post in Russia. Operations at the Consulates General in St. 
Petersburg, Vladivostok, and Yekaterinburg remain suspended.

    Question. In October, the Estonian Prime Minister said Russia is 
near its ``breaking point.'' She claimed Putin's allies are wavering in 
their support for the war in Ukraine. What countries are currently 
supporting Russia's war in Ukraine?

    Answer. Belarus has been complicit in Russia's renewed aggression 
since the start, hosting Russian forces and serving as a launch pad for 
Russia's full-scale invasion. We continue to hold Belarus accountable 
for enabling Russia's war. The Administration is also concerned about 
Russia's growing defense relationship with Iran, including Iran's 
supply of unmanned aerial systems and military trainers to Russia for 
use against Ukrainian civilians. The DPRK's support for Russia's war is 
also of growing concern. The DPRK was one of the few countries to 
recognize the ``independence'' of the so-called ``Luhansk and Donetsk 
People's Republics.'' Moreover, our information indicates the DPRK is 
covertly supplying Russia with a significant number of artillery 
shells.
    The PRC has offered Russia diplomatic support for its war against 
Ukraine and has amplified Russian disinformation regarding the war. The 
United States has warned the PRC that any military support for Russia's 
war effort, or help in evading sanctions, would have serious 
consequences. We have not seen evidence of such activity so far.

    Question. Do you believe the allies of President Putin are 
rethinking their support for the war in Ukraine? If so, what lead you 
to that conclusion?

    Answer. Some leaders of states with longstanding relationships with 
Moscow have indicated growing concern about the war in Ukraine. For 
example, in September Indian PM Modi told Putin that ``today's era is 
not of war.'' Russia's renewal of the Black Sea Grain Initiative 
likewise suggests Russian sensitivity to opinion in the ``global 
south.'' The Administration is committed to diplomatic efforts to 
further isolate Russia and is urging more of the ``fence-sitter'' 
states to use their contacts with Russia to urge Putin to end this war.

    Question. How has Russia's military mobilization impacted the view 
of the Russian people on Putin's war?

    Answer. The fact that so many Russians voted with their feet when 
Putin announced the military mobilization suggests that a significant 
segment of the Russian public does not support this unprovoked war in 
Ukraine. It is estimated that as many Russians fled the country in the 
weeks following the mobilization announcement as were mobilized. Given 
the severe curtailment of expression in Russia and the steep penalties 
for criticizing Putin or the war, it is also likely that many more 
Russians disapproved of the war but remain silent.

    Question. This week Russia unilaterally postponed a technical 
meeting with U.S. officials on the NEW START (the new Strategic Arms 
Reduction Treaty.) In August, Russia prevented U.S. inspections of its 
nuclear arms facilities while continuing to threaten to use nuclear 
weapons. Marshall Billingslea, the former U.S. presidential envoy for 
arms control at the State Department, called Russia's actions an 
``obvious and undeniable violation of the only arms control agreement 
that it hadn't been violating.'' Is Russia currently in violation of 
its New START obligations and commitments?

    Answer. The United States has serious concerns with Russia's 
decision to exempt all of its New START facilities from inspections on 
an indefinite basis. There is an interagency process to evaluate any 
country's compliance with its arms control, disarmament, and 
nonproliferation obligations, which considers a variety of factors. 
These include the nature and precise language of the obligations 
undertaken in the context of international law, information regarding 
the country's activities--including that acquired by so-called National 
Technical Means of verification, cooperative verification measures, 
open-source information, and diplomatic means--and any information 
provided by the country in question over the course of implementation.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you address Russia's attempts to 
use the New START as a bargaining chip for sanctions relief or to 
change its stance on Ukraine?

    Answer. Russia must fulfill its obligations under the New START 
Treaty. The Administration will not link the requirement for Russia's 
full implementation of these existing obligations to unrelated issues.

    Question. In August, President Biden stated he was ready to 
``expeditiously negotiate'' a new nuclear arms control framework with 
Russia to replace New START when it expires in 2026. He added that it 
would require ``a willing partner operating in good faith.'' Do you 
believe Russia is currently operating in good faith?

    Answer. No. Right now, Russia does not meet that requirement, and 
its refusal to allow resumption of New START inspection activities on 
its territory.

    Question. What leverage does the United States have to negotiate an 
extension or broader treaty agreement with Russia?

    Answer. Strategic stability is in the interest of the United States 
and our Allies and partners. It is also in Russia's interest. Russia's 
refusal to resume inspections impacts its ability to monitor 
accountable U.S. nuclear forces and confirm declared data. As both 
countries modernize their nuclear arsenals, resuming inspection 
activity is essential.

    Question. In future arms control negotiations with Russia, are you 
committed to ensuring that the United States is not entering into one 
sided arms control agreements where the United States is the only party 
required to actually make reductions?

    Answer. The fundamental purpose of nuclear arms control is to 
promote nuclear stability and lower the danger of unintended 
escalation. The New START Treaty makes the United States, Russia, and 
the world safer by preserving verified restrictions on both countries' 
strategic nuclear arsenals and avoiding an arms race. If confirmed, I 
will support arms control agreements that are in the national security 
interests of the United States and its Allies and partners.

    Question. In February, President Putin ordered his nuclear forces 
into special combat readiness. As the Russian army has lost ground in 
its war in Ukraine, Putin has increased his threats to use nuclear 
weapons. How close is President Putin to using a nuclear weapon?

    Answer. Putin's nuclear saber-rattling is highly irresponsible. The 
Intelligence Community has reported that it has not seen signs of 
Russian preparations for nuclear weapon use and the Administration has 
no reason to change its strategic deterrence posture to defend itself, 
allies, or partners at this time.

    Question. What actions would you recommend the U.S. and NATO take 
should President Putin use a nuclear weapon?

    Answer. As President Biden has said, any use of nuclear weapons 
would be unacceptable and result in severe consequences.

    Question. U.S.-Eastern Mediterranean Energy Center: When the 
Eastern Mediterranean Security and Energy Partnership Act of 2019

        security?

    Answer. Yes, I commit to supporting on-going efforts to establish a 
U.S.-Eastern Mediterranean Energy Center. The Department of Energy has 
the lead on the East Med Energy Center, and if confirmed, I will work 
closely with DOE colleagues to advance this effort and ensure such a 
Center would support the region's energy transition as well as provide 
opportunities to learn from each other on new energy technologies.

State Department Manangement and Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID.

   What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission Cyprus?

    Answer. Like many missions, U.S. Embassy Nicosia faced challenges 
posed by COVID-19. I understand the Embassy team has shown great 
resilience in their continued service. If confirmed, I can assure you 
the health and safety of the Mission's personnel and family members 
will be my top priority. I look forward to working with the talented 
team and ensuring U.S. Embassy Nicosia is an environment in which all 
can succeed and grow.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Cyprus?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will ensure every member of the U.S. 
Embassy community is treated professionally and with respect. I commit 
to being accessible to all members of the team including U.S. Direct 
Hires, Foreign Service Nationals, Eligible Family Members, Members of 
Household, and contractors. I will work to ensure they are safe and 
secure, and have the resources and guidance necessary to perform their 
jobs successfully. We are at our best when we are supported.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at Mission Cyprus?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will ensure open and continuous 
communication throughout the Mission. I will clearly and regularly 
outline our Mission priorities. It is critical every member of the team 
understands the Mission's priorities and how each individual's work 
contributes to the Mission's success. We are at our best when we work 
together as one team to protect and advance U.S. interests. 
Furthermore, I am committed to supporting a diverse and inclusive 
workforce at U.S. Embassy Nicosia. Diversity makes the Mission strong 
by bringing different perspectives and enhancing creativity and if 
confirmed, I look forward to working with the team to maximize 
innovation and effectiveness.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for Chiefs of Mission. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. Over my 27-year career with the Department of State, I have 
sought to build diverse teams with a clear view of our guiding mission. 
In prior leadership positions--including as U.S. Special Envoy for 
Belarus, as Deputy Assistant Secretary, and as Director of the 
Department's Operations Center--I have led teams and interagency 
processes with an eye to consensus building among diverse stakeholders. 
If confirmed, I will seek to create a space that enables and empowers 
all members of the team to use their voice and find success.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No, it is not acceptable or constructive to berate 
subordinates, either in public or private. If confirmed, I commit to 
leading the U.S. Embassy Nicosia team with respect and professionalism, 
as I have in previous leadership roles. I will not tolerate 
unprofessional behavior including bullying or hazing.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to a close and productive 
relationship with the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM). If confirmed, I 
will work closely with the DCM to advance U.S. priorities in Cyprus, 
including protecting the safety and security of Americans, expanding 
our economic relationship, and advancing shared priorities.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will entrust the Deputy Chief of Mission 
(DCM) with responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the Mission 
and to serve as Charge d'Affaires in my absence. If confirmed, I will 
consult closely with the DCM on a broad range of issues, recognizing 
the extensive experience she brings to this role.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Yes, I believe it is important to provide employees with 
accurate, constructive feedback on their performance to encourage 
improvement and reward those who succeed in their roles. If confirmed, 
I hope to be an inspiring leader with an open-door policy to discuss 
constructive and timely feedback to enhance and lift the performance of 
the entire team.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I would support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees to improve performance and 
reward high achievers, as I have done in previous roles.

    Question. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts 
abroad to meet with local actors, including host government officials, 
non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats stationed in 
Cyprus.

   In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our Embassy walls 
        enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. I firmly believe it is imperative that U.S. diplomats get 
outside of the Embassy to meet with local citizens, including host 
government officials, non-governmental organizations and Americans 
resident in country. In my most recent role, as U.S. Special Envoy for 
Belarus, I was based in Vilnius, Lithuania because the Belarusian 
regime refused to grant my visa. I led our engagement with Belarusian 
citizens in Lithuania, Poland, and other neighboring countries who were 
fighting for their rights and fundamental freedoms from a neighboring 
country. If confirmed, I look forward to traveling throughout Cyprus 
and meeting Cypriots of all backgrounds.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to working closely with U.S. 
Embassy Nicosia's Public Affairs Section to use both social and 
traditional media to reach people across Cyprus. Diversity, equity, 
inclusion, and accessibility are also an important part of public 
diplomacy outreach to ensure efforts reflect the diversity of U.S. 
society and societies abroad and encourage the involvement of people 
from traditionally underrepresented audiences. Given the importance of 
language in signaling respect, I intend to study both Greek and Turkish 
to be able to communicate directly with the island's two communities. 
If confirmed, I will work with the Embassy team to leverage engagements 
with the media, cultural and educational exchange organizations, and 
individual interactions to expand the people-to-people bonds that are 
the foundation of our strong bilateral relationship.

    Question. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts. What is the public diplomacy environment like in 
Cyprus?

    Answer. The United States has strong academic, cultural, and 
professional exchanges with the people of Cyprus. As I understand it, 
despite significant challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, 
U.S. Embassy Nicosia continues to facilitate meaningful cultural 
exchange across the island's ethnic and political divide. If confirmed, 
I will work with the Embassy team to leverage relationships with the 
media, cultural and educational exchange organizations, and individuals 
to expand the people-to-people bonds that are the foundation of our 
strong relationship with the Cypriot people.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge for U.S. 
diplomats to travel and fully engage face-to-face with host country 
nationals. As conditions improve, U.S. diplomats have re-started in-
person engagements and programs. I understand shrinking media freedoms 
in the area administered by the Turkish Cypriots also poses a challenge 
to U.S. Embassy outreach. If confirmed, I look forward to utilizing 
both traditional and social media targeting Greek- and Turkish-speaking 
audiences to engage with the Cypriot people, in addition to in-person 
programs.

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to working with all offices at 
Main State to advance U.S. foreign policy goals in Cyprus. Throughout 
my career, I have worked in Washington and in the field; I know 
firsthand that we are one team working to advance the interests of the 
United States and the American people. I will work to leverage public 
diplomacy tools to advance bilateral economic and security cooperation, 
defend democratic values, and deepen people-to-people ties. I will also 
work to counter adverse influence and mis- and disinformation through 
engagements with traditional media, communication via social media, 
institutional outreach, and personal interactions, and through a 
variety of public diplomacy programming. Working with the public 
diplomacy team, we will tailor our messaging in a way that is most 
appropriate for Cypriot audiences.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, there is nothing I will take more 
seriously than the health and security of the people who will be 
working with me.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Nicosia personnel?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I commit to sharing what information I 
can within the bounds of privacy and security concerns with U.S. 
Embassy Nicosia personnel.

Democracy, Human Rights and International Organizations
    Question. In the 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report, Cyprus was 
upgraded to Tier 1 for its sustained efforts to combat human 
trafficking.

   How will you work with both Turkish and Cypriot leaders to continue 
        to address these issues if you are confirmed as Ambassador?

    Answer. The Government of the Republic of Cyprus (ROC) fully meets 
the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and was 
therefore upgraded to Tier 1 in this year's report. If confirmed, I 
will work with ROC Government counterparts, civil society activists, 
and non-governmental organizations to ensure the ROC continues this 
positive trajectory to combat trafficking. I would focus on the 
prioritized recommendations outlined in the 2022 report, including on 
the investigation, prosecution, and conviction of traffickers. I would 
also work with Turkish Cypriot community leaders, civil society 
activists, and organizations to address the serious U.S. concerns 
related to human trafficking in the area outside of ROC government 
control.

    Question. Do you commit to reporting accurate portrayals of the 
realities of trafficking on the ground in Cyprus to Congress?

    Answer. Yes. If given the opportunity to serve, accurate reporting 
to Congress on human trafficking will remain a priority for me.

    Question. In the 2021 International Religious Freedom report, 
Cyprus was identified as tolerant of religious freedom.

   What is your assessment of this particular issue and if confirmed, 
        how will you work with the Ambassador-at-Large for 
        International Religious Freedom to bolster religious freedom 
        in-country?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will coordinate closely with the U.S. 
Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom and their team 
to advance religious freedom throughout Cyprus. Specific issues noted 
in the most recent report to Congress: Republic of Cyprus (ROC) 
officials continued to deny the right to religious practices of animal 
slaughter and Muslim community leaders reported the government denied 
community access for religious services at 13 of the 19 mosques 
designated as cultural heritage sites, while Greek Orthodox, Maronite 
Catholic, and Armenian Orthodox worshippers reported the ``Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus'' sometimes denied requests to access 
religious sites. Jewish community representatives reported authorities 
performed autopsies on some members of the community whose deaths were 
not suspicious, which violates Jewish religious beliefs and practice. 
If confirmed, I plan to meet with community leaders of all faiths, 
civil society organizations, and ROC government officials to seek their 
views on religious freedom and tolerance.

    Question. In the 2021 Human Rights Report, Cyprus was listed as 
having significant human rights abuses, including refoulement of 
refugees, corruption, and threats of violence against minority groups.

   If confirmed, what steps will you take to address these instances 
        with the host government?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will press the Republic of Cyprus 
government and community leaders to address concerns regarding 
treatment of refugees, corruption, and safety of minority populations 
among other priorities concerning respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms on the island. I will utilize our annual reporting 
to Congress to focus U.S. Embassy Nicosia's engagement on human rights 
issues. I will also use the weight of my office to bring attention to 
the importance the United States places on these issues and amplify the 
voices of civil society and other leaders championing progress in those 
arenas, including via public diplomacy engagements.

    Question. How will you direct your Embassy to work with civil 
society organizations to improve the human rights situation on the 
ground?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would support and encourage my team's 
outreach to a broad range of civil society organizations to address 
human rights across the island. I would prioritize meeting with civil 
society organizations to learn about their work and look for 
opportunities to champion their contributions and achievements, 
including by encouraging Cypriot leaders to regularly engage and 
consult civil society as part of their political process. I understand 
third country nationals are among the most vulnerable to trafficking 
and other human rights abuses. Given this, I would include this 
community as a focus area for U.S. Embassy Nicosia's outreach and 
support.

    Question. Please describe your assessment of the human rights 
situation in Cyprus.

    Answer. I understand the Republic of Cyprus (ROC) government has 
taken steps to identify, investigate, prosecute, and punish officials 
who committed human rights abuses and acts of corruptions. However, as 
highlighted in the 2021 Human Rights Report, there are several 
significant remaining human rights issues in the ROC. These include 
substantial interference with the freedom of association of 
nongovernment organizations; refoulement of asylum seekers; 
mistreatment of migrants and asylum seekers; serious acts of government 
corruption; and crimes involving violence or threats of violence 
targeting members of national or ethnic or minority groups. In the area 
administered by the Turkish Cypriots, human rights remain a serious 
concern on many fronts, from freedom of speech and assembly to 
trafficking in persons. If confirmed, I commit to working with 
Department of State colleagues to promote human rights issues in my 
engagements with ROC and Turkish Cypriot counterparts, local non-
governmental organizations, and victims.

    Question. As Ambassador, how will you help Cyprus confront 
migration and refugee issues on the island, specifically regarding 
refugees who have been stranded in the buffer zone between the Republic 
of Cyprus and northern Cyprus?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will partner with the Republic of Cyprus 
(ROC) government, community leaders, and non-governmental organizations 
across the island to address the migration and refugee issues on the 
island. Seams in Europe--including the decades-long division of the 
island--create serious vulnerabilities for our partners on a diverse 
set of issues. The issue of refugees stranded in the buffer zone is 
just one example. If confirmed, I will engage with all relevant parties 
to ensure such cases are resolved expeditiously and in a manner that 
respects human dignity. I understand overcrowding and resource gaps are 
key challenges in immigration reception and detention centers. This is 
particularly troubling when we know that many unaccompanied children 
are being housed in unsuitable accommodation and do not have a clear 
path forward for protection and a durable solution. If given the 
opportunity to serve, I commit to continuing to prioritize U.S. Embassy 
Nicosia's participation in programs such as the Julia Taft grant 
program, which currently supports vulnerable populations in the ROC's 
primary migrant reception center.

    Question. The U.N. peacekeeping mission, UNFICYP, has been in place 
since the early 1970s and continues to monitor the buffer zone and 
various points of disagreement between the Republic of Cyprus and the 
TRNC.

   How will you engage with the U.N. interlocutors on this issue?

    Answer. The U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) plays a 
critical and stabilizing role on the island. If confirmed, I will 
continue U.S. engagement with the U.N. Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General and Head of UNFICYP to ensure their important work 
continues. As a member of the U.N. Security Council, the United States 
plays a key role in the biannual renewal of UNFICYP's mandate. If 
confirmed, I will work with U.S. Department of State colleagues in 
Washington and New York to ensure they have an accurate and timely 
understanding of the situation on the ground.

    Question. The U.S. Mission to the U.N. has led previous efforts to 
streamline U.N. peacekeeping budgets and missions.

   Do you believe that UNFICYP is meeting its mandate? Why or why not?

    Answer. The U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) has a 
three-part mandate: (1) to prevent a recurrence of fighting, (2) to 
contribute to the maintenance and restoration of law and order, and (3) 
to contribute to a return to ``normal conditions.'' On July 28, the 
U.N. Security Council ``expressed its full support for UNFICYP'' and 
unanimously extended UNFICYP's mandate through January 31, 2023. Based 
on the Council's assessment, I believe UNFICYP is meeting its mandate. 
If confirmed, I will work with colleagues in Washington and New York to 
ensure UNFICYP continues to meet its mandate.

Reunification Efforts
    Question. How can you work with the U.S. Ambassador in Turkey to 
assist in de-escalating the narrative around Varosha?

    Answer. The United States views Turkish Cypriot actions in Varosha, 
with the support of Turkey, as provocative, unacceptable, and 
incompatible with their past commitments to engage constructively on 
settlement talks. If confirmed, I will work in coordination with 
colleagues in Washington, New York, and Ankara to continue to urge 
Turkish Cypriots and Turkey to reverse all steps taken in Varosha since 
October 2020.
    The U.S. has a valuable role to play in the effort to reunify the 
island of Cyprus. We should work to elevate dialogue between the 
Republic of Cyprus and Turkish Cypriot leaders in the north, and resist 
meddling influence coming from Turkey.

    Question. As Ambassador, how would you work to mediate discussions 
between Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders and facilitate progress 
toward their unification?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to using the full weight of my 
office to support Cypriot-led, U.N.-facilitated efforts to reunify 
Cyprus as a bizonal, bicommunal federation with political equality for 
all Cypriots and consistent with relevant U.N. Security Council 
Resolutions. I would actively support U.N.-facilitated efforts at the 
technical level to expand bicommunal cooperation that improves the 
quality of life for all Cypriots and would seek to focus on this voices 
and views of those on the island. I would also meet with the Greek 
Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot negotiators to underscore U.S. support for 
progress on mutually agreeable issues.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
           to Hon. Julie D. Fisher by Senator Jeanne Shaheen

    Question. What efforts can the U.S. promote in Cyprus to combat 
Russian disinformation about the war in Ukraine?

    Answer. I have seen firsthand the positive impact of U.S. 
leadership in countering Russia's disinformation. If confirmed, I will 
champion democratic values throughout my engagements, centering the 
Ukrainian people's fight for democracy as a fight for democracy 
everywhere. I will leverage public diplomacy tools to counter the 
Kremlin's disinformation machine through traditional and non-
traditional media. I will highlight this issue as I travel across the 
island and get to know Cypriots of all backgrounds and as I engage with 
the media. Given the island's long history of political, economic, 
religious, and cultural ties with Russia--including through the 
Orthodox faith and a large Russian expatriate community in Cyprus--I 
will ensure the Embassy's public diplomacy team continues to tailor our 
messaging to reach Cypriot audiences in a meaningful way. Ensuring 
Cypriots see the direct, positive impact of alignment with 
transatlantic partners will be key to countering Russia's 
disinformation.

    Question. What role does the U.S. have in promoting dialogue 
between Cyprus and Turkey?

    Answer. The United States is committed to an Eastern Mediterranean 
region that is free, peaceful, prosperous, and stable. In this vein, 
the United States supports efforts to promote dialogue between our NATO 
Ally Turkey and our partner the Republic of Cyprus. The division of the 
island remains a significant obstacle to relations between these two 
countries. If confirmed, I commit to using the full weight of my office 
to support Cypriot-led, U.N.-facilitated efforts to reunify Cyprus as a 
bizonal, bicommunal federation with political equality for all Cypriots 
and consistent with the relevant U.N. Security Council Resolutions. 
Guarantor powers--the UK, Greece, and Turkey--will all continue to play 
central roles in this process; I will coordinate closely with my 
counterpart Chiefs of Mission in those capitals.

    Question. Does the United States' current role in the Eastern 
Mediterranean adequately promote American energy interests?

    Answer. Yes, and if confirmed, I commit to continuing to promote 
U.S. energy interests in Cyprus, in concert with my counterparts 
throughout the Eastern Mediterranean. Putin's unprovoked war against 
Ukraine and weaponization of gas underscores our longstanding position 
that energy cooperation in the Eastern Mediterranean provides a 
foundation for durable energy security in Europe. The United States 
supports efforts to develop natural gas resources in the region as part 
of our policy to support diversification of energy sources and routes 
in Europe. Currently, U.S. companies Chevron and ExxonMobil have 
licenses from the Republic of Cyprus (ROC) to explore and develop 
hydrocarbon resources in three offshore blocks south of the island. 
These American investments will help Cyprus contribute to European and 
regional energy security. The ROC also has significant solar energy 
potential. If confirmed, I will work to promote opportunities for U.S. 
businesses as Cyprus expands its use of renewable energy. Finally, if 
confirmed I will build on existing U.S. support for regional 
electricity interconnector projects--such as the EuroAsia 
Interconnector--that can support both natural gas and renewable energy 
sources.

    Question. How can the U.S. work more closely with the EU, including 
in Cyprus, to guarantee continued broad compliance with sanctions 
against Russia?

    Answer. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine proved a powerful 
catalyst for the Republic of Cyprus (ROC) to build significantly on the 
progress it has made in recent years to counter illicit finance. While 
the ROC has supported all EU sanction packages and actions--including 
advocating for de-SWIFTing certain Russian institutions ahead of EU 
unity--enforcement capacity lags. At the request of the ROC government, 
the Department of State provided a series of technical workshops 
focused on sanctions compliance and is working with the ROC Government, 
regulatory authorities, and banking sector to build implementation 
capacity, including ability to identify sanctioned or Russian or 
Belarusian-linked entities operating in Cyprus, prevent establishment 
of new legal entities, trusts, or shell companies in Cyprus by 
sanctioned Russian individuals, and take appropriate enforcement or 
mitigating measures against actors that may be connected to the evasion 
of EU, U.S., or other sanctions regimes. Thus far, ROC officials closed 
27 bank accounts tied to sanctioned entities, revoked passports of 
eight sanctioned Russians and their 27 family members, denied port 
access to Russian vessels, and took steps to strengthen private sector 
cooperation through rigorous certification programs. Due to the success 
of these workshops, the Department has provided similar trainings for 
additional EU partners vulnerable to sanctions evasion, including the 
Baltic states. If confirmed, I will be an advocate for continued 
sanctions cooperation in Cyprus to ensure we deny access to the ill-
gotten gains of key enablers of Putin's war of choice.



                               __________


       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
             to Hon. Julie D. Fisher by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. As we speak, the Party is 
cracking down on unprecedented student protests across the country. 
With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry, the CCP 
could stop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. The President made it clear in his National Security 
Strategy that the People's Republic of China (PRC) harbors the 
intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international 
order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its 
benefit. As Secretary Blinken said on May 26, we will invest in 
America, align with our Allies, and compete with the PRC to defend our 
interests and build our vision for the future. If confirmed, I will 
strengthen our partnership with the Republic of Cyprus (ROC), including 
working with the ROC to implement investment screening mechanisms to 
key technologies, data, and infrastructure from national security 
risks.

    Question. Does the CCP undertake any activities that are beneficial 
to U.S. interests?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors, as the President 
laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United States does not 
seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our allies and partners have an 
opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in a way that 
influences their behavior even as we compete with them. The United 
States' approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC 
where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them when 
they align. If confirmed, I will continue working closely with the 
Republic of Cyprus to strengthen our shared values of democracy and 
support for the rules-based order.

    Question. Do you believe there are any areas within which the CCP 
would constructively work with the United States in good faith?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors, as the President 
laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United States does not 
seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our allies and partners have an 
opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in a way that 
influences their behavior even as we compete with them. The United 
States' approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC 
where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them when 
they align. If confirmed, I will continue working closely with the 
Republic of Cyprus to strengthen our shared values of democracy and 
support for the rules-based order.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China in 
Cyprus?

    Answer. As the United States National Security Strategy makes clear 
and as Secretary Blinken said in October, the People's Republic of 
China (PRC) is the greatest geopolitical challenge that we face because 
it is the only competitor with the intent, and increasingly the 
capability, to remake the international order. And Beijing's actions 
suggest PRC officials have the intention to do so. PRC companies 
continue to invest in Republic of Cyprus (ROC) infrastructure and the 
ROC's current mobile telecommunications infrastructure is dominated by 
Huawei. Both government and private communications companies have been 
reluctant to adopt measures requiring rapid replacement of this 
equipment but are increasingly receptive to the U.S. Government 
arguments about security and data privacy risks. The United States' 
approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC where our 
interests and values differ and cooperating with them when they align. 
If confirmed, I will support the Administration's policy on the PRC.

    Question. Cyprus has been divided since 1974 and remains a source 
of tension in the region between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. 
Turkish Cypriots administer the northern third of the island, backed by 
Turkish military presence. A U.N. peacekeeping mission monitors a 
buffer zone dividing the two areas. For decades, the U.N. has 
facilitated Cypriot-led negotiations on reunification, which have been 
unsuccessful to date. Cyprus' foreign policy is driven by close ties to 
Greece and continual disputes with Turkey. The U.S. cooperates with 
Cyprus bilaterally through the ``Greece-Israel-Cyprus + U.S.'' format 
and is at a historic high. My and Senator Menendez' 2019 Eastern 
Mediterranean Security and Energy Partnership Act authorizes new 
International Military Education Training program assistance for 
Cyprus. Despite closer ties, the U.S.-Cyprus relationship may be 
impacted by developments in the U.S.-Turkey relationship and Cyprus' 
traditionally close relationship with Russia.

   How do you assess the U.S.-Cyprus bilateral relationship?

    Answer. The Republic of Cyprus is a highly valued partner. The 
United States collaborates bilaterally with the Republic of Cyprus on 
issues of mutual interest including combatting terrorism, enhancing 
maritime and border security, and promoting regional stability. Our 
security cooperation allows us to better respond to challenges in the 
region. The U.S.-funded regional training center known as CYCLOPS--the 
Cyprus Center for Land, Open Seas, and Port Security--is an example of 
bilateral cooperation that benefits the security of the broader region. 
Our cooperation in multilateral fora, including the 3+1 format, plays 
an important role in promoting regional cooperation on a broad range of 
issues. If confirmed, I will work to deepen our efforts in these fields 
and seek opportunities to expand it into others.

    Question. As Ambassador, what would be your priorities for 
enhancing the relationship and countering Russian malign influence?

    Answer. If confirmed, my top bilateral priority will be to continue 
building our partnership with the Republic of Cyprus (ROC) in the 
security and economic arenas. I will protect American interests and 
focus on ensuring a positive role for the ROC in advancing regional 
security and stability.
    I have seen firsthand the positive impact of U.S. leadership in 
countering Russia's malign influence and disinformation. If confirmed, 
I will champion democratic values throughout my engagements including 
highlighting to government and civil society counterparts the Kremlin's 
malign actions in Cyprus, Europe, and around the globe. I will leverage 
public diplomacy tools to counter the Kremlin's disinformation machine 
through traditional and non-traditional media, as I have done in 
previous roles. I will highlight this issue as I travel across the 
island and get to know Cypriots of all backgrounds and as I engage with 
the media. Given the island's long history of political, economic, 
religious, and cultural ties with Russia--including through the 
Orthodox faith and a large Russian expatriate community in Cyprus--I 
will ensure the Embassy's political-economic and public diplomacy teams 
continue to tailor our private and public messaging to reach Cypriot 
audiences in a meaningful way. Ensuring Cypriots see the direct, 
positive impact of alignment with transatlantic partners will be key to 
countering Russia's malign influence. If confirmed, I will work with 
the ROC Government to limit the resonance of Russia's malign activity 
on the island.

    Question. How has Russia's 2022 war on Ukraine impacted the economy 
and security situation of Cyprus?

    Answer. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine called for a 
unified transatlantic response reflecting the depth of our shared 
values and respect for the rules-based international order. Beyond the 
conflict in Ukraine, Putin's war of choice has had second and third-
order impacts. Cyprus, a member of the EU since 2004, has weathered 
significant economic disruption, particularly in the tourism and 
services sector. In 2019, before the pandemic and EU sanctions 
following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian tourists 
accounted for a fifth of tourists to Cyprus--780,000 out of a total of 
4 million. In 2022, Russian tourists to Cyprus totaled approximately 
20,000. According to the European Commission's May 2022 Economic 
Forecast, economic activity on the island slowed from 5.5 percent in 
2021 to 2.3 percent in 2023 due to the negative impact of Russia's 
invasion of Ukraine and inflation. I understand the ROC Government 
views solidarity with Ukraine as a values-based position which will 
likely continue in any future government. If confirmed, I will work 
with the ROC Government and engage with the Cypriot people to encourage 
their continued solidarity with Ukraine.

    Question. Cypriot banks have a disproportionately high share of 
Russian deposits. While Cyprus has tightened its anti-money laundering 
banking framework, it remains susceptible to exploitation and 
corruption. To what extent, if any, has the Cypriot economy's exposure 
to Russia changed since Russia's invasion of Ukraine?

    Answer. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine proved a powerful 
catalyst for the Republic of Cyprus (ROC) to build significantly on the 
progress it has made in recent years to counter illicit finance. While 
the ROC has supported all EU sanction packages and actions--including 
advocating for de-SWIFTing certain Russian institutions ahead of EU 
unity--enforcement capacity lags. At the ROC government's request, the 
U.S. Department of State provided a series of technical workshops 
focused on sanctions compliance and is working with the government, 
regulatory authorities, and banking sector to build implementation 
capacity, including ability to identify sanctioned or Russia or 
Belarus-linked entities operating in Cyprus, prevent establishment of 
new legal entities, trusts, or shell companies in Cyprus by sanctioned 
Russian citizens, and take appropriate enforcement or mitigating 
measures against actors that may be connected to the evasion of EU, 
U.S., or other sanctions regimes. Thus far, ROC officials closed 27 
bank accounts tied to sanctioned entities, revoked passports of eight 
sanctioned Russian citizens and their 27 family members and took steps 
to strengthen private sector cooperation through rigorous certification 
programs. Due to the workshops' success, the Department has provided 
similar trainings for additional EU partners vulnerable to sanctions 
evasion, including the Baltic states. If confirmed, I will be an 
advocate for continued sanctions cooperation in Cyprus to ensure we 
deny access to the ill-gotten gains of key enablers of Putin's war of 
choice.

    Question. How do you assess the Republic of Cyprus' response to the 
war?

    Answer. The Republic of Cyprus (ROC) has a long history of 
political, economic, religious, and cultural ties with Russia, 
traditionally reaffirmed by regular senior-level visits between Nicosia 
and Moscow. Despite this, the ROC Government made a clear decision in 
the wake of Russia's invasion to stand with Ukraine. The ROC has 
supported all EU sanction packages and actions--including advocating 
for de-SWIFTing certain Russian institutions ahead of EU unity. In 
response to Russia's brutal war, the ROC closed its ports to Russian 
military vessels even before the EU-wide ban, denying refueling and 
servicing to vessels which engaged in destabilizing actions in Syria, 
harmed regional security, and contributed to forced displacement. Since 
February 24, the ROC has welcomed more than 30,000 Ukrainian refugees 
to Cyprus. Of those 30,000, more than 14,000 have sought temporary 
protected status in Cyprus. The ROC government provided its largest 
humanitarian donation in history to Ukraine, including food, medicine, 
and other critical supplies. The Cypriot people have demonstrated great 
generosity and humanity in their humanitarian outreach to Ukrainians. 
They have raised funds, held concerts, attended rallies, and provided 
food, shelter, and financial assistance to Ukrainians in need. If 
confirmed, I will work with the ROC Government and the Cypriot people 
to maintain their important support for Ukraine and international 
order.

    Question. Absent progress by the U.N., how might the United States 
help reduce tensions in the region, including between Cyprus and 
Turkey?

    Answer. The United States is committed to an Eastern Mediterranean 
region that is free, peaceful, prosperous, and stable. In this vein, 
the United States supports efforts to promote dialogue between our NATO 
Ally Turkey and our partner the Republic of Cyprus. The division of the 
island remains a significant obstacle to relations between these two 
countries. If confirmed, I commit to using the full weight of my office 
to support Cypriot-led, U.N.-facilitated efforts to reunify Cyprus as a 
bizonal, bicommunal federation with political equality for all Cypriots 
and consistent with the relevant U.N. Security Council Resolutions. 
Guarantor powers--the UK, Greece, and Turkey--will all continue to play 
central roles in this process; if confirmed, I will coordinate closely 
with my counterpart Chiefs of Mission in those capitals.

    Question. What role should the U.S. play surrounding the East Med 
gas pipeline proposal, which has increased tensions between Cyprus and 
Turkey?

    Answer. Putin's aggression in Ukraine and subsequent actions to 
disrupt gas supplies to European consumers underscores our longstanding 
position that energy cooperation in the East Mediterranean provides a 
foundation for durable energy security and economic prosperity in the 
East Mediterranean region and the rest of Europe. We remain committed 
to physically interconnecting East Mediterranean and Middle East energy 
to Europe. The Administration's stance on the Eastern Mediterranean Gas 
Pipeline (EMGP) has not changed. We are continuing to shift our focus 
to electricity interconnectors that can support both natural gas and 
renewable energy sources. A new pipeline such as the EMGP, which is not 
under construction, would not contribute to European energy security in 
the immediate or even medium term. The United States welcomed the 
agreement reached June 15 among Israel, Egypt, and the EU to provide 
additional gas from the East Mediterranean to Europe via LNG. This 
agreement takes advantage of existing infrastructure and will directly 
improve Europe's energy security over the short term by reducing 
dependence on Russian energy sources. If confirmed, I will be an 
advocate for regional cooperation that can bring sustainable and 
durable energy security to Cyprus and the region.

             to Hon. Julie D. Fisher by Senator Todd Young

    Question. If confirmed, how would you support the ongoing efforts 
to unify the two Cypriot factions?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to using the full weight of my 
office to support Cypriot-led, U.N.-facilitated efforts to reunify 
Cyprus as a bizonal, bicommunal federation with political equality for 
all Cypriots and consistent with the relevant U.N. Security Council 
Resolutions. With that goal in mind, I would actively support U.N.-
facilitated efforts at the technical level to expand bicommunal 
cooperation that improves the quality of life for all Cypriots. I would 
meet with the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot negotiators to 
underscore U.S. support for progress on mutually agreeable issues. I 
would also be an advocate for continued U.S. Government support for the 
Committee on Missing Persons, a group committed to returning home the 
1,027 victims, including three U.S. citizens, still missing from the 
1963-1974 periods of intercommunal violence.

    Question. As recently as last month, Al Jazeera reported that 
Turkish-Cypriot authorities have threatened ousting U.N. peacekeeping 
officials from their territory. This is due in part to the U.S. 
decision to remove an embargo on arms sales to Cyprus. Do you agree 
with the decision to lift the arms embargo to Cyprus?

    Answer. I agree with the Secretary's decision to lift defense trade 
restrictions on the Republic of Cyprus (ROC) for FY 2023. This decision 
is based on the U.S. Government's assessment the ROC has met the 
necessary legislative conditions and is consistent with our broader 
goals of increasing interoperability with our partners and countering 
potential malign influence by certain actors. I understand the decision 
was in no way linked to the decades long division of the island and 
does not signal a change in U.S. policy with respect to Cypriot-led, 
U.N.-facilitated efforts to reunify the island.
    Specifically, the decision was based on the determination that the 
ROC Government has met the necessary conditions outlined in the Eastern 
Mediterranean Security and Energy Partnership Act of 2019 and the 
National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2020. The ROC Government met 
the first condition by continuing to cooperate with the United States 
on anti-money laundering regulations and financial regulatory 
oversight. The ROC Government met the second condition by taking steps 
to deny Russian military vessels access to Cypriot ports for refueling 
and servicing. These Russian military vessels engaged in destabilizing 
actions in Syria, harmed regional security, and contributed to forced 
displacement.

    Question. How will the decision to lift the embargo and the 
Turkish-Cypriot reaction affect efforts to unify Cyprus?

    Answer. The Secretary's decision to lift defense trade restrictions 
on the Republic of Cyprus for FY 2023 does not reflect a change in the 
U.S. position on a Cyprus settlement. The United States continues to 
support a comprehensive settlement to reunify the island as a bizonal, 
bicommunal federation with political equality for all Cypriots. If 
confirmed, I will work to counter false narratives related to the U.S. 
decision to lift defense trade restrictions and seek to build 
confidence in efforts to reunify Cyprus through U.S. support for issues 
of mutual benefit to both communities on the island.

Regions Impacted by Armenia's Attack
    Question. Close to a third of Armenian territory was directly 
impacted by Azerbaijan's September attack.

   Will you commit to visiting the regions impacted by Azerbaijan's 
        recent invasion to better understand the assistance required to 
        help make those communities whole?

    Answer. Yes. If confirmed, I will travel to the regions effected by 
the violence early in my tenure to assess the ongoing impact on those 
communities and identify resources the United States could provide to 
meet their needs.

Armenian Genocide
    Question. I have long championed recognition of the Armenian 
genocide. It is important that we recognize this history not only when 
it is easy, but when it is hard.

   If confirmed, will you raise recognition of the Armenian genocide 
        in regional formats that require you to interact with 
        interlocutors from Turkey and Azerbaijan?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to doing everything in my power to 
remember the victims of the Armenian genocide and support a peaceful 
future for Armenia. I will not hesitate to raise the importance of 
recognizing and remembering the Armenian genocide in any appropriate 
forum.

Nagorno-Karabakh
    Question. There is serious concern for the wellbeing of ethnic 
Armenians living in Azerbaijan-controlled Nagorno-Karabakh.

   Does the U.S. believe that specific rights or legal status should 
        be guaranteed to ethnic Armenians living there? If so, what 
        specific rights or legal status should they be guaranteed?

    Answer. The ethnic Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh is 
entitled to security, human rights, and fundamental freedoms. The State 
Department will continue to press Azerbaijan to explain and clarify to 
this population and the international community, in a way that is 
transparent and verifiable, how this population will be protected. The 
State Department continues to raise the need for rights and security 
for the population of Nagorno-Karabakh in every engagement with 
Azerbaijan--including with President Aliyev.
    Armenia has acknowledged that a conversation between the 
representatives of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh and the 
Azerbaijani Government is essential for securing the rights and 
security of the ethnic Armenian population. The United States has long 
supported the Helsinki Final Act (1975) principles of Non-Use of Force, 
Territorial Integrity, and the Equal Rights and Self-Determination of 
Peoples. While these can serve as guiding principles, the parties to 
the conflict need to have an honest, open conversation about rights and 
security and reach an agreement that is acceptable to all sides. This 
is not something the United States or any outside party can or should 
decide for them.

    Question. What barriers remain before Turkey and Armenia can come 
to an agreement to open up their borders to each other?

    Answer. The United States strongly supports Armenia-Turkey 
normalization, which would be good for the entire region, and is 
working bilaterally with both Turkey and Armenia to encourage progress. 
Both Turkey and Armenia have appointed special envoys for 
normalization. These envoys have met multiple times and agreed on some 
initial confidence-building measures. While more needs to be done to 
advance these negotiations and to implement agreed measures, the 
Department commends both Armenia and Turkey for taking initial steps in 
this direction.

    Question. What role have we seen the Russian ``peacekeepers'' play 
in Nagorno-Karabakh?

    Answer. The United States was not involved in the November 9, 2020, 
ceasefire brokered by Russia between Armenia and Azerbaijan that 
resulted in the deployment of Russian ``peacekeepers'' to the region 
for a term of five years.
    A comprehensive settlement to the conflict between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan that addresses rights and security and resolves other 
outstanding issues would obviate the need for Russian ``peacekeepers'' 
to remain in the area.
    The State Department has not seen anything to indicate that the 
Russian military presence in Armenia played a mediating role in 
fighting that broke out in Nagorno-Karabakh in March or along the 
Armenia-Azerbaijan border in September 2022.

    Question. Has the role of Russian ``peacekeepers'' in Nagorno-
Karabakh changed since Russia invaded Ukraine? If so, how has their 
role changed?

    Answer. As with the Russia-brokered ceasefire, the State Department 
has little visibility into the Russian ``peacekeepers'' actions in 
Nagorno-Karabakh.
    Armenia and Azerbaijan have both complained publicly about Russian 
``peacekeeper'' responsiveness to developments in and around Nagorno-
Karabakh.
    Because the United States was not party to the 2020 ceasefire and 
do not have direct access to the region patrolled by Russian 
peacekeepers, the State Department is not in a position to 
independently assess any change in their behavior since February 2022.

    Question. How can the U.S., and specifically of U.S. Embassy 
Yerevan, support conflict prevention and stabilization efforts in 
conjunction with the OSCE?

    Answer. Direct, open constructive discussion and negotiation is 
essential to the prevention of conflict and the successful conclusion 
of a sustainable peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The United 
States is helping facilitate this through robust engagement. Recent 
engagements by the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, 
and other senior Administration officials highlight the extent to which 
the United States is committed to helping Armenia and Azerbaijan 
negotiate a long-term political settlement to the conflict.
    The United States is engaging bilaterally, with likeminded partners 
such as the EU, and through international institutions like the OSCE, 
to facilitate direct dialogue between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
    The Department and U.S. Embassy Yerevan continue to develop 
programs to strengthen and advance ties between the peoples of the 
region to foster the necessary conditions for developing a shared 
vision for a peaceful, prosperous, and stable South Caucasus. These 
programs include Track II initiatives to bring together youth, to 
strengthen economic ties, and to develop relationships between future 
political leaders.

Foreign Influence in Armenia and the Caucasus
    Question. What is the U.S. doing to stop bad actors like Iran and 
China from taking advantage of the recent deterioration of Russian 
influence in the Caucasus region, especially with regard to Armenia?

    Answer. While the Department recognizes Armenia's and Azerbaijan's 
delicate geographic position vis-a-vis Iran, it has consistently 
encouraged both countries to assess Iran's intentions in the region 
comprehensively, and to proceed with caution in all dealings involving 
the Iranian regime. Armenia has committed to implementing U.S. 
sanctions against Iran, despite the negative economic impact that could 
result to Armenia's economy.
    While the PRC continues to seek inroads into Azerbaijan and Armenia 
due to its geostrategic neighborhood and its location at regional trade 
crossroads, so far, the PRC has a limited presence. In Armenia, the 
Department's priority vis-a-vis China is to urge Armenia to establish 
fair and reciprocal economic relationships that do not disadvantage 
American companies. Toward this end, the Department is advocating for 
passage and implementation of robust investment screening legislation 
to safeguard regional security and data privacy.

    Question. What is your assessment of Armenia-Iran relations and its 
impact on US national security?

    Answer. The Department is aware of efforts by Iran to make headway 
in the south Caucasus by expanding its political, security, and 
economic presence. While Armenia and Iran enjoy cordial relations, 
their ties are mostly official and declarative. Iran cannot offer the 
types of partnerships the United States can in the economic, political, 
security, and people-to-people spheres.
    While the Department recognizes Armenia's delicate geographic 
position vis-a-vis Iran, we consistently encourage Armenia to assess 
Iran's intentions in the region comprehensively, and to proceed with 
caution in all dealings involving the Iranian regime. Armenia has also 
committed repeatedly to complying fully with all U.S. sanctions, 
including against Iran, and has demonstrated good faith in these 
efforts.

    Question. What role do you believe the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia 
should play in negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan?

    Answer. I believe the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia should serve as an 
honest broker with the Government of Armenia and provide Washington 
with a clear-eyed view of the position of the Government and the 
situation on the ground, including in the border regions. The Secretary 
has consistently said that direct dialogue between Armenian and 
Azerbaijan is the only way to achieve a sustainable peace. The 
Department and our Missions in Yerevan and Baku play a critical role to 
facilitate that dialogue. If confirmed I will continue this effort and 
work with the Department, my colleagues in Baku, and the U.S. Senior 
Advisor for Caucasus Negotiations to help further Armenia and 
Azerbaijan's work toward a comprehensive peace agreement.

    Question. What role do you believe the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia 
should play in negotiations between Armenia and Turkey?

    Answer. The State Department strongly supports Armenia-Turkey 
normalization, which would be good for the entire region.
    Both Turkey and Armenia have appointed special envoys for 
normalization. These envoys have met multiple times and agreed on some 
initial confidence-building measures. While more needs to be done to 
advance these negotiations and to implement agreed measures, the 
Department commends both Armenia and Turkey for taking initial steps in 
this direction.
    If confirmed, I will work with the Department and my counterpart in 
Turkey, Ambassador Flake, to help facilitate ongoing dialogue between 
Armenia and Turkey and assist in the implementation of important 
confidence building measures that the special envoys have agreed to 
during their recent engagements.

    Question. How can the U.S. work in conjunction with the EU efforts 
toward normalization between Armenia and its neighbors in the region?

    Answer. As the Department has said publicly, the United States 
stands ready to support the peace process bilaterally, multilaterally, 
and together with partners. This includes our strong support for 
efforts by EU Council President Charles Michel to bring the leaders 
together in support of a lasting peace. The Department is in regular 
contact with our EU counterparts both in Brussels and in capitals and 
calibrate our bilateral efforts to work in tandem with the EU and 
maintain momentum for concrete progress toward peace between Armenia 
and Azerbaijan.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you leverage your experience as 
charge d'affaires to Ukraine, given the similarities between Armenia 
and Ukraine in dealing with a hostile neighbor?

    Answer. I saw first-hand in Ukraine the methods Russia uses to 
exert malign influence and pressure on sovereign nations it considers 
part of its ``sphere of influence,'' and learned lessons on effective 
strategies to counter them. If confirmed, I would deploy all the tools 
at my disposal to strengthen Armenia's ability to freely choose its 
partners and allies, and to counter Russian disinformation and 
misinformation. Areas of focus would include strengthening democracy, 
rule of law, and anti-corruption and other institutions; promoting a 
diverse energy market that does not rely on a single source; and 
broadening trade and investment relationships, particularly with the 
United States.

    Question. How do you intend to combat Russian, Iranian, and Chinese 
disinformation and malign influence in Armenia?

    Answer. The best defense against disinformation is a strong U.S. 
public presence that delivers accurate U.S. messages directly to the 
public. If confirmed, I would have an active public presence aimed at 
delivering and defending U.S. messages. The Department has also 
developed strong tools, such as journalism training and media literacy 
programs, to combat misinformation and disinformation. If confirmed, I 
would actively deploy these tools to push back on Russian, Iranian and 
Chinese disinformation.

    Question. In your view, what can the U.S. do to help prevent future 
outbreaks of armed conflict in the South Caucasus?

    Answer. Recent engagements by the Secretary of State, the National 
Security Advisor, and other senior Administration officials highlight 
the extent to which the United States is committed to helping Armenia 
and Azerbaijan negotiate a long-term political settlement to the 
conflict.
    The United States is ready to engage bilaterally, and with 
likeminded partners such as the EU, and through international 
institutions like the OSCE, to facilitate direct dialogue between 
Azerbaijan and Armenia.
    Both Armenia and Azerbaijan continue to seek our engagement in the 
peace process and have continued to engage directly in peace efforts.

Democracy, Human Rights and Reforms
    Question. Given the tension between PM Pashinyan and opposition 
lawmakers in Armenia, how do you intend to engage with both sides to 
promote stability and democratic reform?

    Answer. Nikol Pashinyan's election in 2018 and again during 
parliamentary elections in 2021 reflects the direction Armenian 
citizens want their country to go--towards a democratic and inclusive 
government. I commend PM Pashinyan's democratic reform efforts, which 
the United States recognized by inviting Armenia to participate in the 
Summit for Democracy. But I know more work is necessary to help the 
Armenian Government and its people realize their vision for a durable, 
vibrant, and inclusive democracy that is economically resilient and 
responsive to its citizens. If confirmed, I will engage with all 
stakeholders, including civil society, opposition parties in 
parliament, and political parties currently outside of government to 
help Armenia realize this vision.

    Question. Reforms to strengthen democratic structures, rule of law, 
including constitutional reform, reform of the judiciary and combat of 
fraud and corruption remain tenuous in Armenia.

   In your view, what can be done to ensure systemic and institutional 
        solutions to the governance issues that persist in Armenia?

    Answer. Institutions matter. Strong democratic institutions will 
form the backbone for a fair and inclusive government that meets the 
needs of all its citizens and makes Armenia a stronger nation better 
able to defend its sovereignty. An effective and transparent legal and 
regulatory environment is essential to creating the strong institutions 
necessary to ensure continued democratic growth. If confirmed, I will 
work with the Armenian Government, civil society, and opposition 
leaders, to urge Armenia to adopt important constitutional reforms and 
enact other key legislation. This is particularly necessary to ensure 
judicial impartiality and independence and to help a free press grow in 
Armenia.

    Question. What can be done in Armenia to combat gender-based 
discrimination, particularly gender-biased sex selection in pregnancy? 
Do you believe that the U.S. Government should be more active in this 
arena?

    Answer. Having the appropriate protections under the law is an 
essential step in combating discrimination and ensuring equal treatment 
for all citizens, including women and girls. I understand that Armenia 
has drafted a law on ensuring equality. If confirmed I will press for 
Armenia to consider that draft legislation closely to make sure it 
protects all, including the most vulnerable among Armenian society. I 
will also urge Armenia to pass and implement the legislation.

    Question. In the 2022 Trafficking in Persons report, Armenia 
remained on Tier 2 for a lack of sustained efforts to combat 
trafficking in persons. How will you work with civil society and the 
interagency to bolster anti-trafficking work in country?

    Answer. I understand that the Government of Armenia is making 
significant strides in improving its trafficking in persons record, but 
more work is needed. If confirmed, I will continue the important reform 
assistance the Department is providing Armenian law enforcement to 
deliver security in a manner that is transparent and respects human 
rights, institutionalizing those reforms and making sure they are 
adopted throughout Armenia. I will also urge Armenia to adopt all of 
the U.S. prioritized TIP Report recommendations including making sure 
first responders consistently screen vulnerable populations for 
trafficking indicators, adequate training is provided to investigators 
and prosecutors, and victim-centered policies are established within 
the judicial process.

    Question. In the 2021 Human Rights Report, Armenia was listed as 
having a litany of human rights abuses, including censorship, child 
labor, torture, and more. If confirmed, what will you do as Chief of 
Mission to bolster human rights in country?

    Answer. I know that Armenia has taken some steps to ameliorate some 
human rights concerns, but progress has been uneven. If confirmed, I 
will work with the Government and all relevant stakeholders to better 
protect and strengthen the rights of all, including the most vulnerable 
individuals in Armenia. I will urge the Government to take all 
necessary steps to prevent any regression in the protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms.

Democracy, Human Rights and Reforms
    Question. Do you see U.S. economic engagement with Armenia and its 
neighbors as a means toward building trust, interdependency, and 
stability in the region?

    Answer. Absolutely. As a relatively small, land-locked country with 
large sections of its borders closed to trade and commerce, Armenia 
recognizes the importance of improving its economic trajectory by 
reducing barriers to trade and increasing broad-based economic growth 
by diversifying its economic and energy base and trading partners. The 
United States similarly seeks to expand economic prosperity and 
opportunity in Armenia through increased trade and investment, energy 
diversification, and market-oriented economic reforms. If confirmed, I 
would continue to work with the Government to increase competitiveness, 
reduce trade and investment barriers, and improve the business-enabling 
environment in the country. I would also seek to resolve outstanding U. 
S. company business disputes in Armenia. The United States seeks to 
deepen our engagement among regional actors by strengthening regional 
cooperation, advancing reconciliation efforts, resolving lingering 
disputes relating to international borders, and participating in 
independent and western-supported economic initiatives and people-to-
people programs.

    Question. If so, how can the U.S. support economic engagement and 
integration between Armenia and its neighbors?

    Answer. Armenia can improve its economic trajectory by reducing 
barriers to trade and increasing broad-based economic growth. Promoting 
increased trade and investment as well as energy diversification and 
supporting market-oriented economic reforms will directly support 
regional reconciliation. If confirmed, I would support Armenia's 
economic resilience and inclusive economic growth by advocating for a 
level economic playing field and a free-market economy. I would seek to 
help Armenia improve its capacity to manage natural resources and work 
with my regional counterparts to increase energy and water security by 
encouraging engagement among regional neighbors. Ongoing normalization 
efforts between Armenia and its neighbors Turkey and Azerbaijan are key 
to this overall effort and have the greatest potential for a positive 
economic outcome for both Armenia and the wider South Caucasus region.

    Question. How can the U.S. encourage investment, including from the 
U.S. and other countries' private sectors in Armenia?

    Answer. Armenia presents a variety of opportunities for investors, 
and the country's legal framework and government policy aim to attract 
investment, but the investment climate is not without challenges. 
Obstacles include Armenia's small market size, relative geographic 
isolation due to closed borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan, weaknesses 
in the rule of law and judiciary, and a legacy of corruption.
    In May 2015, Armenia signed a Trade and Investment Framework 
Agreement with the United States. This agreement established a United 
States-Armenia Council on Trade and Investment to discuss bilateral 
trade and investment and related issues. In November 2017, Armenia 
signed a Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement with the 
European Union, which aimed in part to improve Armenia's investment 
climate and business environment.
    The U.S. supports ongoing anti-corruption efforts to encourage a 
transparent, fair, and predictable business climate. If confirmed, I 
will also support dialogue between investors and government officials 
to resolve problems in an expeditious manner. I would also work to 
resolve investment disputes between U.S. and Armenian companies, which 
would send a positive signal about Armenia's investment climate and 
benefit U.S. investors.

State Department Manangement and Public Diplomacy
    Question. Many U.S. Missions have been under enormous stress over 
the last few years, in large part due to COVID.

   What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission Yerevan?

    Answer. My understanding is that Mission Yerevan is very well 
managed, but morale has been adversely impacted by the 2020 and 
September 2022 fighting, and the COVID epidemic.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Yerevan?

    Answer. As a leader, I have found that frequent direct 
communication and interaction with Embassy teammates, both formal and 
informal, provide a platform for employees to share their concerns and 
suggest steps to address those concerns. If confirmed, I would 
prioritize engagement with all Embassy staff, and follow up quickly and 
fully when concerns are raised. I would also expect Country Team 
members to adopt a similar policy, and I would make clear that all 
Embassy staff must be treated with respect, and that issues of concern 
be proactively elicited and addressed.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified Mission and vision 
at Mission Yerevan?

    Answer. I am a strong believer in communication and would hold 
regular town halls and section meetings to reinforce a whole-of-Mission 
approach, and regularly host informal Mission gatherings to encourage 
cross-section relationships.
    If confirmed, I would begin my tenure by working with the Country 
Team to develop a clear set of objectives and actions to meet them. I 
would regularly review these with the Team to gauge progress and make 
adjustments as necessary. I would reinforce these objectives in my 
Embassy-wide engagements and make clear my expectation that section 
chiefs would do the same with their teams.

    Question. How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I always strive to create an environment in which team 
members enjoy their work and feel supported by the Mission.
    I consider my management style to be open and inclusive. I believe 
in engaging all members of my team directly when possible and making 
clear that my door is open if there is a serious problem to address. I 
would hold members of my team accountable for inappropriate or illegal 
behavior.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. It is never acceptable to berate subordinates, and, if 
confirmed, I would make clear to all managers that they are to apply 
this management principle.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. I consider the relationship with a Deputy Chief of Mission 
to be fundamentally important, and would seek to include him/her in all 
decision-making, with an ability to stand in for me if needed. I 
consider the DCM to be an advisor and second pair of eyes on overall 
Embassy morale and effectiveness. I would look to my DCM to keep a 
close watch on Embassy operations and inform me of any significant 
issues so we can agree on a path forward.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your Deputy Chief of Mission?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would ask my DCM to meet regularly with 
Country Team members to track the work and operations of each Embassy 
section. I would ask the DCM to chair the Emergency Action Committee, 
the Law Enforcement Working Group, and other groups that require 
coordination among the interagency at Post. I would also ask the DCM to 
lead the First and Second Tour Officer Working Group, aimed at 
supporting the development of new diplomats, and identify opportunities 
for me to regularly engage with the members.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Yes, I strongly believe that regular feedback is vital to 
encourage improvement and award high performance. If confirmed, I would 
personally ensure the timely, complete, and accurate completion of all 
Embassy EERs, working with section heads and our management team.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. Yes, I would work with my DCM, Management Counselor and 
Country Team to ensure that all supervisors provide regular feedback--
whether positive or developmental--to their staff. I would also 
encourage supervisors to take full advantage of the Department Awards 
Program to recognize high achievers.

    Question. In your opinion, do U.S. diplomats get outside of our 
Embassy walls enough to accomplish fully their missions?

    Answer. I consider it imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of 
the Embassy to meet with local actors, including host government 
officials, non-government organizations, and fellow foreign diplomats 
stationed in Armenia. If confirmed, I pledge to work closely with the 
Regional Security Office and my management team to keep our employees 
safe while giving them maximum flexibility to travel the country and 
meet regional officials and people across Armenia.

    Question. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. 
diplomats to better access all local populations?

    Answer. I would set an example by spending a significant portion of 
my time outside the Embassy conducting public diplomacy and meeting 
with Armenian interlocutors. I would schedule regular travel outside 
Yerevan to better understand views outside the capital. I would 
encourage all Embassy personnel to do the same, and would ensure that 
supervisors apply workload management practices that would allow 
regular outside engagement. I would leverage the five ``American 
Corners'' located throughout Armenia to conduct outreach and public 
diplomacy.

    Question. What is the public diplomacy environment like in Armenia?

    Answer. Armenia has a diverse free press and active civil society. 
The media environment--while rated ``not free'' by Freedom House--does 
allow for some independent voices, especially online. Armenia has 
strong political and economic ties to Russia and the people of Armenia 
are greatly influenced by Russian media. But there are abundant 
opportunities for engagement and public diplomacy, as Armenians 
maintain generally positive attitudes towards the United States and are 
interested in American views and opinions. Public diplomacy efforts are 
dedicated to strengthening civil society, exchange opportunities 
especially from marginalized groups, expanding STEM education and 
English language learning opportunities, supporting an independent 
media, and countering disinformation through media literacy.

    Question. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face 
there?

    Answer. The Armenian media and information space continues to face 
challenges amidst growing polarization and an increase in 
disinformation following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
Russia plays an outsized role in Armenia's media landscape, 
particularly in covering foreign news. The Public Diplomacy Section is 
bolstering media literacy, professional exchanges, and education to 
build up a cadre of professional, independent journalists essential for 
a functioning democracy

    Question. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus 
the in-country Mission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy 
messages for foreign audiences?

    Answer. It is important to continue to train, resource, and support 
Public Diplomacy professionals who are best positioned to listen, 
engage with, and understand key local audiences, develop targeted 
strategic communication and outreach plans, and translate foreign 
policy priorities into effective, tailored messages, as well as monitor 
and evaluate the success of their programs. Our core Mission objectives 
align closely with top Department and Administration priorities--
strengthening democracy, combating corruption, advancing shared 
security, and building prosperity--and our Public Diplomacy team 
creatively tailors and deploys high-level USG messaging to our local 
audiences. If confirmed, I will work with the Public Diplomacy Section 
to ensure a continued unified approach to highlighting key U.S. 
messages and policies in Armenia. The Public Diplomacy Section 
routinely engages in a wide range of public outreach--through 
traditional and social media, and in person engagements to inform and 
engage Armenians about U.S. policy; promote Embassy activities and 
events; enhance the image of the United States; and provide information 
on security, voting, and other topics of interest to U.S. citizens; and 
communicate with the Armenian public.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. I take these incidents extremely seriously. I am very aware 
of Anomalous Health Incidents--including the interagency efforts to 
protect and care for our personnel and uncover the cause of these 
incidents. These incidents are an absolute priority for the Department, 
and it would be an absolute priority for me if I am confirmed.
    As the President has said, the health and well-being of American 
public servants is of paramount importance to the Administration. On a 
personal level, I have no higher priority than the safety of the 
members of my Embassy team and their family members.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Mission Yerevan personnel?

    Answer. Yes, I believe strongly in as open and honest communication 
as possible with all Embassy team members.

    Question. How can the U.S. continue to engage with Armenia to 
reduce their military and political reliance on Russia, while 
maintaining our ongoing commitment to peace in Nagorno-Karabakh?

    Answer. A strong, democratic Armenia will be in a better position 
to freely choose their own partners and allies. The assistance provided 
by the United States to support civil society, electoral processes, 
energy security, anti-corruption reforms, and trade expansion will all 
contribute to a stronger Armenia. State Department support for a 
durable peace agreement with Azerbaijan and normalization with Turkey 
seeks to broaden Armenia's options for economic and energy 
diversification.
    We regularly discuss security issues with Armenia as part of the 
U.S.-Armenia Strategic Dialogue mechanism, focusing on areas where we 
can help Armenia improve capacity and resilience to chart a more 
independent course. Our assistance fosters interoperability with U.S. 
and NATO forces, bolsters Armenia's international peacekeeping 
contributions, supports Armenia's Individual Partnership Action Plan 
with NATO, and assists with defense reforms. Under the State 
Partnership Program, the Kansas National Guard works closely with the 
Armenian military to build capabilities and interoperability with the 
United States.

    Question. The Collective Security Treaty Organization, or CSTO, has 
allowed Russia to retain influence in the post-Soviet sphere and 
develop its own regional military alliance, although I understand there 
are frustrations from the Armenian government in how Russia has reacted 
to the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The U.S. must continue to 
work for a peaceful and lasting solution to this conflict.

   To what extent does the CSTO allow Russia to spread disinformation 
        and bolster its military presence in Eastern Europe, and how 
        can the U.S. and Armenia effectively engage to reduce these 
        malign influences?

    Answer. Armenia, like every other country--regardless of their 
geography or history--has the right to pursue its foreign relations as 
it chooses, in the furtherance of its own interests, and in accordance 
with international law. No country should attempt to undermine that 
right.
    Russia has utilized CSTO deployments and missions in member states, 
including Armenia, to create a perception of Russia being a good faith 
mediator to conflicts in the former USSR. The Kremlin creates and 
spreads disinformation in an attempt to confuse and overwhelm people 
about Russia's real actions in Ukraine, Georgia, and elsewhere in 
Europe. The United States government continues to focus on rebutting 
and countering Russian disinformation and on shining a light on 
Russia's malign influence operations.

       Responses to Additional Questions for the Record Submitted
              to Kristina A. Kvien by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. As we speak, the Party is 
cracking down on unprecedented student protests across the country. 
With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry, the CCP 
could stop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. The President made it clear in his National Security 
Strategy that the People's Republic of China (PRC) harbors the 
intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international 
order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its 
benefit. As Secretary Blinken said on May 26, we will invest in 
America, align with our Allies, and compete with the PRC to defend our 
interests and build our vision for the future.
    If confirmed, I will immediately establish a China working group at 
Embassy Yerevan to ensure all sections and agencies are tracking and 
responding to coercive PRC practices in Armenia. I will work closely 
with the Government of Armenia to defend against these practices, 
including implementing a robust investment screening mechanism to 
protect sensitive Armenian industries and critical infrastructure.

    Question. Does the CCP undertake any activities that are beneficial 
to U.S. interests?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors, as the President 
laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United States does not 
seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our allies and partners have an 
opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in a way that 
influences their behavior even as we compete with them. The United 
States' approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC 
where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them when 
they align. If confirmed, I will continue working with Armenia to 
identify PRC attempts to undermine Armenia's security or economy, while 
strengthening our shared values of democracy and support for a rules-
based order.

    Question. Do you believe there are any areas within which the CCP 
would constructively work with the United States in good faith?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors, as the President 
laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United States does not 
seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our allies and partners have an 
opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in a way that 
influences their behavior even as we compete with them. The United 
States' approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC 
where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them when 
they align. If confirmed, I will continue working with Armenia to 
identify PRC attempts to undermine Armenia's security or economy, while 
strengthening our shared values of democracy and support for a rules-
based order.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China in 
Armenia?

    Answer. As the United States National Security Strategy makes clear 
and as Secretary Blinken said in October, the People's Republic of 
China (PRC) is the greatest geopolitical challenge that we face because 
it is the only competitor with the intent and increasingly the 
capability to remake the international order. Beijing's actions suggest 
PRC officials have the intention to do so. The United States' approach 
towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC where our interests 
and values differ and cooperating with them when they align. If 
confirmed, I will support the Administration's policy on the PRC.

    Question. Armenia remains in a fragile state after the end of a 
conflict with Azerbaijan in 2020. Armenia's dependence on Russia is a 
prominent feature of Armenia's foreign policy, security, and economic 
sector. Armenia has remained neutral to Russia's Ukraine war and has 
become a destination for many Russian nationals who left Russia's 
economy, repressive environment, and military mobilization. Some 
Armenians have questioned Russia's reliability as a security and 
economic partner, given Putin's Ukraine conflict and failure to prevent 
Azerbaijan from launching attacks in 2020. Since March 2022, Armenia 
has indicated a readiness to negotiate with Azerbaijan regarding 
borders and the status of Nagorno-Karabakh region. Despite the close 
ties to Russia, the U.S. and Armenia have enjoyed positive relations 
since 1991. The current government of Nikol Pashinyan had even 
indicated a break with Armenia's history of pro-Russian foreign policy.

   In your view, how have the events of the past year set the stage 
        for enhancing U.S.-Armenia relations, including a break from 
        Russia?

    Answer. Russia's unprovoked, unjustified attack on Ukraine in 
February made clear to all of Russia's regional allies that Russia is 
not a reliable partner nor a force for stability in the region. Despite 
its economic and security ties to Russia, Armenia has not supported 
Russia's war against Ukraine, and has committed to upholding U.S. and 
European financial sanctions.
    An internally strong, democratic Armenia will be in a better 
position to freely choose its own partners and allies. The assistance 
provided by the United States to support civil society, electoral 
processes, energy security, anti-corruption reforms, and trade 
expansion will all contribute to a stronger Armenia. U.S. support for a 
durable peace agreement with Azerbaijan and normalization with Turkey 
seeks to broaden Armenia's options for economic and energy 
diversification.
    We regularly discuss regional security issues with Armenia as part 
of the U.S.-Armenia Strategic Dialogue mechanism, focusing on areas 
where we can help Armenia improve capacity and resilience to chart a 
more independent course. Our assistance fosters interoperability with 
U.S. and NATO forces, bolsters Armenia's international peacekeeping 
contributions, supports Armenia's Individual Partnership Action Plan 
with NATO, and assists with defense reforms. Under the State 
Partnership Program, the Kansas National Guard works closely with the 
Armenian military to build capabilities and interoperability with the 
United States.

    Question. In your view, should the U.S. provide more security 
assistance to Armenia than Azerbaijan?

    Answer. If confirmed, once on the ground in Yerevan, I would 
carefully review Armenia's assistance needs, including in the security 
area, and make recommendations to Washington, working closely with 
Congress. I would take full advantage of the Security and Defense 
Working Group of our U.S.-Armenia Strategic Dialogue mechanism to 
address these issues.
    Our security assistance fosters interoperability with U.S. and NATO 
forces, bolsters Armenia's international peacekeeping contributions, 
supports Armenia's Individual Partnership Action Plan with NATO, and 
assists with defense reforms. Under the State Partnership Program, the 
Kansas National Guard works closely with the Armenian military to build 
capabilities and interoperability with the United States.

    Question. In your opinion, what is the future of the Minsk Group 
and on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh region?

    Answer. The United States supports any process that will result in 
a durable peace. We'll continue to engage in all constructive paths 
forward, bilaterally and with partners like the EU or the OSCE, in 
support of a lasting solution to the conflict and the issues stemming 
from it.
    The ethnic Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh is entitled to 
security, human rights and fundamental freedoms. The State Department 
will continue to press Azerbaijan to explain and clarify to this 
population and the international community, in a way that is 
transparent and verifiable, how this population will be protected. The 
State Department continues to raise the need for rights and security 
for the population of Nagorno-Karabakh in every engagement with 
Azerbaijan--including with President Aliyev.
    Armenia has acknowledged that a conversation between the 
representatives of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh and the 
Azerbaijani government is essential for securing the rights and 
security of the ethnic Armenian population. The United States has long 
supported the Helsinki Final Act (1975) principles of Non-Use of Force, 
Territorial Integrity, and the Equal Rights and Self-Determination of 
Peoples. While these can serve as guiding principles, the parties to 
the conflict need to have an honest, open conversation about rights and 
security and reach an agreement that is acceptable to all sides.

    Question. What is the U.S. position on Russian military forces in 
Nagorno-Karabakh?

    Answer. The United States was not involved in the November 9, 2020, 
ceasefire brokered by Russia between Armenia and Azerbaijan that 
resulted in the deployment of Russian ``peacekeepers'' to the region 
for a term of five years. The U.S. Department of State has not seen 
anything to indicate that the Russian military presence in Armenia 
played a mediating role in fighting that broke out in Nagorno-Karabakh 
in March or along the Armenia-Azerbaijan border in September.
    A comprehensive settlement to the conflict between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan that addresses rights and security and resolves other 
outstanding issues would obviate the need for Russian ``peacekeepers'' 
to remain in the area. If confirmed, I would do all in my power to 
support such a settlement.

    Question. What is your assessment of Armenia's position and 
policies with respect to Russia's war against Ukraine?

    Answer. The Armenian government has not supported Russia in recent 
U.N. Security Council Resolutions condemning Russian actions. Armenia 
has also committed to complying with all financial sanctions against 
Russia. It is doing so even though these sanctions are potentially 
detrimental to Armenia's own economy.
    I saw first-hand in Ukraine the methods Russia uses to exert malign 
influence and pressure on sovereign nations it considers part of its 
``sphere of influence,'' and learned lessons on effective strategies to 
counter them. If confirmed, I would deploy all the tools at my disposal 
to strengthen Armenia's ability to freely choose its partners and 
allies, and to counter Russian disinformation and misinformation. Areas 
of focus would include strengthening democracy, rule of law, and anti-
corruption and other institutions; promoting a diverse energy market 
that does not rely on a single source; and broadening trade and 
investment relationships, particularly with the United States.

Congressional Notifications
    Question. Do you commit to ensuring that the Peace Corps keeps the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee fully and currently informed of its 
activities and to ensure that the Congressional Notifications the 
agency transmits to the committee are not older than two years?

    Answer. Yes

    Question. Do you commit to instructing the Peace Corps to discard 
any Congressional Notification (CN) of more than two years of age so as 
to ensure that CNs are current when transmitted to the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee?

    Answer. Yes

Peace Corps Return to Service
    Question. In March 2020, Peace Corps made the difficult decision to 
suspend volunteer operations overseas due to the pandemic. This year, 
Peace Corps has successfully sent over 750 volunteers and Trainees to 
serve in 32 countries.

   What are your plans for returning to a full cohort of volunteers?

    Answer. As of December 2022, the Peace Corps has returned 
volunteers to service in 45 countries with approximately 900 volunteers 
on the ground. Currently, the Peace Corps is issuing invitations for 
volunteers to serve in 11 additional countries, bringing the total up 
to 56. The agency's top priority is returning volunteers to service 
overseas in a way that is safe for them, our staff, and the host 
communities in which volunteers live and work. To that end, that is why 
the Peace Corps has developed and applied a comprehensive re-entry 
strategy and assessment process and began service return with small 
cohorts to ensure systems function effectively to support scale-up.
    The Peace Corps is making every effort to return to pre-pandemic 
service levels. The agency is keenly aware of areas of attention and 
monitoring that may impact our immediate success, such as recruitment 
challenges and conflict in countries where the Peace Corps maintains a 
presence.
    Like other employers, including service-oriented organizations, the 
Peace Corps is facing challenges with recruitment of qualified 
candidates. This is exacerbated by continued uncertainty related to 
COVID-19 and its impact around the world. To attract new candidates, 
the Peace Corps has launched a robust social media campaign, is 
reinvigorating its in-person recruiting schedule, and will begin a new 
marketing campaign specifically designed to target the young Americans 
that make up the bulk of our volunteer cohorts.
    As we navigate the challenges of conflict and instability in some 
countries where the agency has had a strong presence in the past, we 
are also working on country agreements for a return to Solomon Islands 
and El Salvador. We have also received and are assessing formal 
invitations from additional countries that have requested Peace Corps 
presence.
    The agency is moving ahead with returning volunteers to service and 
I am confident that the Peace Corps will have a robust cohort of 
qualified volunteers serving globally by 2025.

    Question. What do you believe are the appropriate health and safety 
protocols in order to continue sending volunteers abroad and how do you 
plan to implement these protocols?

    Answer. The health, safety, and security of Peace Corps volunteers 
are the agency's highest priorities. The Peace Corps has traditionally 
operated in some very challenging environments across the globe, and 
the very nature of Peace Corps service entails risk. The Peace Corps' 
approach to safety and security is an engaged partnership involving the 
agency, the volunteer, and the communities we serve. Each entity plays 
a unique and important role in enhancing the safety of the volunteer. 
Therefore, we devote significant resources to train staff, community 
members and volunteers; a robust site selection process; and the 
implementation of comprehensive emergency response systems. We engage 
and coordinate closely with the United States Embassy in each Peace 
Corps country, as well as with our local and community partners who 
play a fundamental role in assisting our volunteers to identify risks 
and adopt culturally appropriate strategies to enhance their own safety 
and security, reducing risk where possible.
    To ensure that the agency is ready to meet today's security 
challenges, the Peace Corps has made a number of systemic improvements 
to our safety and security tools including: enhanced site development 
and site selection criteria; a comprehensive review and update of our 
emergency action planning process; updated global safety and security 
core training sessions; and a new security management system to track 
crimes committed against volunteers and the support services offered by 
the agency. The Office of Safety and Security (OSS) at headquarters has 
invested significant time to train Safety and Security Managers at each 
post on the updated policies, systems, and operational changes. 
Additionally, the agency provides applicants with safety data specific 
to their proposed country of service, so that applicants can make 
informed decisions before accepting the invitation to serve.
    In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Peace Corps has 
taken concrete steps to improve its capacity to anticipate and meet 
challenges associated with public health emergencies. These steps 
include establishing new and alternative medical evacuation options, 
devising specific protocols and emergency plans for volunteers to 
prevent or address infection, adapting medical clearance requirements 
to take into consideration COVID risk factors, and reengineering 
virtually every aspect of programming and operations to mitigate risk, 
wherever possible. As anticipated, volunteers have tested positive for 
COVID-19 since returning to service; however, all individuals have 
experienced mild symptoms, and the impacts to the local community have 
been minimized, largely due to protocols and emergency plans in place.
    The agency also recognizes the need for expanded mental health 
support for volunteers following the pandemic. The agency has enhanced 
our capabilities to provide coaching and support available to 
volunteers. The Peace Corps will rely on our decades of experience in 
emergency response to continuously monitor COVID-19 conditions and make 
informed decisions. If confirmed, I will continue to support these 
efforts with a keen focus on agility and adaptability, which have 
always been central to how the Peace Corps operates.

    Question. What specific steps will you take to ensure that all 
sites selected for volunteer placement are safe for volunteers? What 
criteria would you use?

    Answer. The Peace Corps devotes significant resources toward the 
identification, review, and selection of sites for volunteer 
placements. Each Peace Corps post (``post'' is the term for a Peace 
Corps office in a host country) has country-specific criteria and 
procedures that it uses to assess prospective sites that address local 
safety, security, housing standards, communication, transportation, and 
emergency medical services. In 2021, in a major enhancement of our 
information technology with regard to security, the agency implemented 
our Site Incident Management System (SIMS), which allows us to better 
document and analyze crimes and specifically match them with individual 
sites to ensure that proposed sites do not have a history of crime 
incidents that would preclude placement of future volunteers. SIMS also 
enables the Peace Corps to provide a complete record of support and 
services provided to volunteers who experience any crime during 
service. Each site is reviewed and approved by a multi-disciplinary 
team that consists of security, medical, and programming staff. 
Furthermore, site-specific information collected during this process is 
stored in our online database for future use and reference. If 
confirmed, I will continue to support the offices involved in site 
selection to ensure that all of our sites meet the agency's criteria 
for our volunteers.
    Our staff are trained in their roles and responsibilities within 
this process and the Peace Corps' regional Safety and Security Officers 
routinely visit each post to evaluate local systems and work with local 
staff to enhance and strengthen the overall process where needed. On a 
broader level, Peace Corps Country Directors at each post are part of 
the U.S. Embassy's Emergency Action Committee and work closely with 
State Department officials and local and community partners to stay 
abreast of new or emerging trends.

    Question. As Peace Corps volunteers return to conflict ridden 
countries, how will you assess whether volunteers are safe to return 
and what safety mechanism will you put in place in case of an emergency 
while volunteers were in-country?

    Answer. Our top priority is returning volunteers to service 
overseas in a way that is safe for them, our staff, and the host 
communities in which they will live and work. Since the global 
evacuation of Peace Corps volunteers, the agency has developed and 
applied a comprehensive re-entry strategy and assessment process, that 
includes specific medical, security, programmatic, administrative, and 
logistical criteria that each post must meet prior to consideration for 
re-entry. As part of this process, the Peace Corps coordinates closely 
with post staff, host country partners and government officials, as 
well as with our interagency partners, to continuously monitor 
conditions on the ground and guide site placement.
    The Peace Corps has significant experience working in a variety of 
complex settings and has robust systems to identify and respond to 
risk. For example, each Peace Corps post has a comprehensive Emergency 
Action Plan (EAP) that is designed to address threats specific to that 
country. These plans provide in-depth guidance and instructions to both 
staff and volunteers on how to plan for and respond to emergency 
situations. Staff and volunteers are trained on their roles and 
responsibilities within the EAP. The U.S. Embassy in country is also 
provided with a copy of the Peace Corps EAP.
    If conditions in a country deteriorate from the time of initial 
invitation to a volunteer's enter-on-duty date, such that it is no 
longer safe for volunteer service the Peace Corps works with invitees 
to offer an alternate placement.

    Question. What are the strategies that you are implementing to 
ensure that volunteer recruitment is both robust and high quality, so 
that it meets the needs of our partners abroad and our goals for an 
agency that advances core equity and inclusion goals?

    Answer. As a people-to-people development agency operating in a 
complex global environment, understanding and respecting other cultures 
while representing the diversity of the U.S. is crucial to the Peace 
Corps' success in fulfilling its mission to promote world peace and 
friendship. The Peace Corps will continue to prioritize the recruitment 
of, and support for, volunteers who represent the full diversity of the 
United States and who can support the development priorities of host 
communities. The Peace Corps' Office of volunteer Recruitment and 
Selection (VRS) prioritizes attracting applicants that meet the needs 
of posts and the local communities we serve. To that end, we work to 
match potential volunteer skillsets with host community requirements. 
Recruiters work with applicants to successfully navigate and address 
each element of the application to be as competitive as possible. 
Furthermore, placement staff carefully review and assess each 
application to ensure they are invited to serve in a country where 
their skills and experience are best suited.
    One of our focus areas, as outlined in the agency's strategic plan, 
is to recruit and retain a volunteer cadre that reflects the diversity 
of America. To meet that goal, VRS is executing a targeted recruitment 
strategy designed to increase the Peace Corps' presence and awareness 
in underrepresented and underserved communities. Ultimately, this work 
will help build a pipeline of individuals from diverse backgrounds, who 
will become future Peace Corps volunteers. VRS fosters formal 
partnerships and pursues other engagement opportunities with 
educational institutions, including several Minority Serving 
Institutions (MSIs). This calendar year, VRS has placed an emphasis on 
greater engagement with smaller, often less resourced MSIs, to learn 
more about the needs of each institution and their unique student body. 
To this end, we are working to establish and sustain university 
partnerships that are instrumental to introducing the opportunities 
that exist in international service through the Peace Corps to diverse 
student audiences and prepare them for success in the application 
process and eventual service.
    At the interagency level, the Peace Corps also actively 
participates in the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational 
Equity, Excellence and Economic Opportunity through Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Through this initiative, the Peace 
Corps promotes service opportunities within the HBCU community by 
engaging directly with faculty and staff to develop and sustain 
mutually beneficial relationships.
    Additionally, VRS is working to build strong partnerships with 
organizations, institutions, and community groups that support and 
reflect the diversity of our nation. VRS is training the entire 
recruitment team to effectively recruit future volunteers from all 
backgrounds. This ensures that every Peace Corps recruiter has the 
language, tools, resources, and strategies necessary to successfully 
conduct outreach to underrepresented populations in communities across 
the nation.
    The agency is also working to attract Americans of all 
socioeconomic backgrounds to Peace Corps service, which requires 
intentional work to reduce financial barriers in the application 
process. In support of this effort, the Peace Corps has determined that 
applicants can be fully reimbursed for all eligible expenses required 
for medical clearance. Additionally, in calendar year 2023, the Peace 
Corps will conduct a barrier analysis, as called for in our strategic 
plan, and use the resulting data to determine how to identify and 
reduce barriers along the path to and through service., including 
socioeconomic ones.
    As the Peace Corps returns to service in an uncertain environment, 
I am committed to continuous review and evaluation of our strategies 
and structures to attract a robust and diverse cadre of volunteers.

Safety of Peace Corps Volunteers
    Question. A key provision in the Sam Farr and Nick Castle Reform 
Act, passed by Congress in 2018, outlines seven criteria to be met in 
the hiring of well-qualified and capable medical officers and support 
staff for overseas Peace Corps posts, and for the Agency to review and 
evaluate performance and health care delivery of all Peace Corp medical 
staff.

   How would you assess the success rate of the agency hiring overseas 
        medical staff who meet the criteria outlined in this 
        legislation? If you are facing difficulties, what are the 
        challenges in fulfilling this provision?

    Answer. The Peace Corps has been able to hire candidates who meet 
the criteria set forth in the Farr-Castle Act through the agency's 
improved Peace Corps Medical Officer (PCMO) hiring process, employing a 
multi-faceted recruitment strategy and a rigorous interview and 
credentialing process that establishes standards for the review and 
verification of the education, training, expertise, and license of PCMO 
candidates. To date, 100 percent of the PCMO roles are filled in an 
average time of 7 months from vacancy to start date.
    New PCMOs participate in an intensive mentoring process, whereby an 
experienced PCMO provides guidance to the new PCMO for a minimum of 
three months. New PCMOs also attend Overseas Staff Training where they 
receive an in-depth overview of key Peace Corps' policies and 
procedures. They are required to obtain 50 hours per year of continuing 
medical education and participate in annual Peace Corps Continuing 
Medical Education conferences. PCMOs receive annual evaluations, which 
include an assessment of their professional performance, and clinical 
and technical skills.
    The agency has developed a formal process to assess the health 
staffing needs of each post based on criteria such as the number of 
volunteers, the number of medical accommodations, country conditions, 
and health care services available in the country.
    The primary challenge in filling vacancies is the length of time 
required to recruit, credential, train, and clear new PCMOs for 
service. To ensure compliance with requirements to have two PCMOs at 
each post, the agency utilizes temporary assignments, rovers, and 
intermittent experts.

    Question. There is an apparent need to update and codify many 
reforms and improvement to the agency's work. What is your view of the 
Peace Corps Reauthorization Act of 2022, and what are the benefits to 
the Peace Corps that this legislation will bring?

    Answer. I welcome the committee's bipartisan leadership to 
strengthen the Peace Corps by addressing a number of issues through the 
Peace Corps Reauthorization Act of 2022. This legislation will make 
several significant changes that will further enhance the ability of 
the Peace Corps and our volunteers to represent America abroad and to 
bring those skills back to the United States. Some of the specific 
benefits to the agency and volunteers in the bill include:


   Increasing the statutory minimum for volunteer monthly readjustment 
        allowance from $125 to $375;

   Codifying the suspension of loan payment obligations and accrual of 
        interest on certain federal student loans during service by 
        volunteers and granting credit for any federal loan forgiveness 
        program;

   Making it easier for volunteers whose service has been disrupted by 
        emergencies to resume service;

   Enhancing post-service support for volunteers, which will help 
        their transition back to the United States;

   Codifying the extension of non-competitive eligibility for federal 
        employment for returned volunteers, which can strengthen 
        recruitment of volunteers and should also benefit the State 
        Department, U.S. Agency for International Development, and 
        other federal agencies by making it easier for returned 
        volunteers to continue their public service at those agencies;

   Renewing the Sexual Assault Advisory Committee, which, if 
        confirmed, I will continue even in the absence of legislation;

   Codifying and enhancing existing policies protecting volunteers 
        against reprisal or retaliation; and

   Issuing authority to suspend employees without pay pending 
        investigations leading up to final decisions on cases of 
        removal for misconduct (an authority the Peace Corps currently 
        does not have).

OIG Semi-Annual Report
    Question. The most recent Peace Corps Office of Inspector General 
semi-annual report outlined two areas of concern: the incomplete 
migration of crime data to the new volunteer Information Database 
Application system due to technical issues and its potential impact on 
volunteer safety and the need to establish a comprehensive Enterprise 
Risk Management program and develop a strategy and structure that 
integrates information security into business operations:

   Do you commit to working to implement the recommended changes from 
        the Peace Corps Office of the Inspector General semi-annual 
        report?

    Answer. Yes. I will also note that during the time that I served as 
Acting Director or Chief Executive Officer of the Peace Corps, starting 
in January 2021 until November 2022, the agency reduced the number of 
open recommendations from the Office of the Inspector General by 80 
percent. I am committed to continuing this effort, if confirmed.

Ethiopia Re-Entry
    Question. The Peace Corps recently notified Congress of its 
intention to resume the mission to Ethiopia, where there is ongoing 
unrest in various parts of the country, and the Abiy Ahmed regime's 
record of governance and human rights violations is troubling.

   Can you explain how the Peace Corps reached its decision to resume 
        the Peace Corps mission to Ethiopia?

    Answer. In April of this year, Peace Corps security staff conducted 
an in-depth, on-theground assessment that focused on the conflict, 
terrorism, crime, environmental threats, and emergency planning. During 
the assessment, Peace Corps security staff met with U.S. Embassy 
officials, local and regional law enforcement, local partners, United 
Nations officials, and international non-governmental organizations. 
The 2022 assessment included significant travel in the areas around the 
Peace Corps regional offices in Jimma and Hawassa, as well as the 
Butajira training site. Based on the information gathered during the 
assessment, the Peace Corps security staff recommended restricting 
volunteer travel and site placements to these regions in the southern 
half of the country, along with sites that could be supported out of 
the main Peace Corps office in Addis Ababa.
    The overall security situation in the country deteriorated after 
our assessment was concluded and after a Congressional Notification was 
submitted to Congress to begin the re-entry process of volunteers. As a 
result, the Peace Corps has paused the reentry process. We have 
identified a series of decision points to assist in monitoring 
developments on the ground to determine when and if conditions permit 
the return of volunteers. These include, but are not limited to, the 
successful implementation of the peace treaty, a prolonged and 
sustained cease-fire, resumption of humanitarian aid to the north, and 
withdrawal of Eritrean forces.
    I commit, if confirmed, to continued consultation with you, the 
Ranking Member, and your respective staff regarding the Peace Corps' 
presence in Ethiopia.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
           Submitted to Carol Spahn by Senator James E. Risch

Management
    Question. What is your understanding of morale throughout the Peace 
Corps?

    Answer. Volunteer morale is an area we closely monitor. In the last 
available five years of data (20142019), we have seen a high level of 
satisfaction among volunteers, with more than 80 percent saying they 
would recommend Peace Corps service to others. Voluntary resignations 
have remained relatively stable and at a low level, with between 6 
percent and 7 percent of volunteers resigning annually between 2015 and 
2019.
    We prioritize staff morale; it is critical to the success of the 
agency. Based on the 2021 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS), 82 
percent of Peace Corps staff say it is a good place to work and 75 
percent say they are very satisfied or satisfied with their job.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale within the Peace 
Corps?

    Answer. Since the global evacuation, the Peace Corps has received 
feedback from a variety of stakeholders, including staff, returned 
volunteers, and the National Peace Corps Association. This feedback 
encompassed a broad range of topics that impact our stakeholders at a 
deeply personal level, including diversity, equity, inclusion, 
accountability, and sexual assault. As I was serving as Acting Director 
and Chief Executive Officer, we embraced this feedback, listened, and 
adjusted our training, systems, and policies accordingly to ensure that 
all volunteers not only have a positive service experience in the 
communities in which they serve, but also have a positive experience 
with the Peace Corps, as an agency.
    To date, our work to improve morale has included extensive training 
with staff to expand skill sets in diversity, equity and inclusion as 
well as in active listening and trauma-informed care. As an agency, we 
are also acutely aware of the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 
pandemic and how it may impact the volunteer experience. To that end, 
we have expanded mental health and coaching services. In addition, we 
have established a return to service working group that is continuously 
evaluating reentry challenges that may impact volunteer morale, and 
proposing policy and other changes, when appropriate.
    Robust training, effective site management, and responsive, 
empathetic volunteer support also contribute to a productive and 
rewarding service experience. During the period without volunteers 
abroad, the Peace Corps intensified implementation of process 
improvements, training, and quality checks in these areas. This 
includes the culmination of a multi-year project, in collaboration with 
host country partners and volunteers, to implement logical project 
frameworks, streamline reporting, and roll out a new competency-based 
training model.
    While the agency made significant, meaningful reforms and engaged 
in urgent COVID-19 response and recovery efforts during the period with 
no volunteers in the field, it has been a challenging time for Peace 
Corps staff. In addition to managing significant uncertainty on a 
personal and professional level, it has required constant adaptation. 
During this period, I have prioritized proactive and transparent 
communication, implemented remote and hybrid work structures, and 
ensured broad engagement in strategic planning and implementation. We 
have also engaged staff across functions and across borders in new 
communities of practice, supported staff development, celebrated the 
accomplishments of teams across the agency, and focused on wellness. To 
guide this work, we utilized FEVS and host country staff surveys to 
ensure that staff in the U.S. and overseas are supported and have the 
tools they need to do their jobs effectively and efficiently.
    If confirmed, I am committed to a continuous process of proactive 
engagement and learning as we navigate the complexities of operating in 
today's environment, and to adapt, as necessary, to the evolving needs 
of a global workforce to attract and retain talent.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at the Peace Corps?

    Answer. The Peace Corps' mission and three goals are codified in 
the Peace Corps Act and are incorporated into everything we do as an 
agency. I have never served in an organization whose mission is so 
clear and whose staff, volunteers, returned volunteers and other 
stakeholders identify so closely with the values that drive the 
implementation of that mission.
    When I was serving as Acting Director, the agency engaged staff at 
all levels in the development of the agency's Fiscal Year 2022-2026 
Strategic Plan. This process allowed us to collaborate and identify 
shared priorities for how we will further our mission over the next 
four years. Progress towards the plan is reviewed quarterly to ensure 
focus and prioritization. If confirmed, I will continue efforts to 
engage broadly as we adapt and innovate to meet the evolving needs of 
volunteers and host countries.

    Question. Management is a key responsibility for agency executives. 
How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I would describe my management style as adaptive. The 
uncertainty inherent in today's global environment requires continuous 
evaluation and adjustment in response to a rapidly changing context.
    The Peace Corps is a very dynamic agency working in complex 
environments around the world. Strong systems and clear decision making 
are essential. Having managed in a variety of functional and 
programmatic areas, cross-cultural settings, and external environments, 
I am able to manage holistically and strategically.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your deputy?

    Answer. I envision my leadership relationship with my deputy to be 
driven by deep trust and strategic and operational alignment; and I 
would invest significant time and energy into developing a seamless 
working relationship.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your deputy?

    Answer. I believe in fully leveraging complementary skill sets to 
maximize the effectiveness of leadership teams. Generally speaking, I 
would entrust significant day-to-day management responsibilities to the 
deputy and would focus primarily on strategic and representational 
duties of the Director, if confirmed.

    Question. ``Anomalous health incidents,'' commonly referred to as 
``Havana Syndrome,'' have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. 
diplomats around the world for years. They have caused serious, 
negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy, yet many believe that the 
Department is not doing enough to care for, protect, and communicate to 
its personnel.

   If confirmed, do you commit to taking this threat seriously?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. If confirmed, do you commit to talking as openly as you 
can to Peace Corps employees and volunteers about this serious issue?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. As you may be aware, there is significant congressional 
concern in re-opening the Peace Corps in Ethiopia. However, due to the 
unpredictable nature of the conflict and serious security concerns, it 
is my opinion that this not go forward at this time. Therefore, I have 
placed a formal hold on the Congressional Notification (CN) currently 
before the committee.

   Do you commit to honoring this hold and pausing re-entry protocol 
        into Ethiopia?

    Answer. Given the change in the overall security situation in the 
country after the CN was sent to the Committee, the Peace Corps has 
paused the re-entry process, and will not contest the hold. I commit, 
if confirmed, to continued consultation with your staff and that of the 
Chairman should conditions change on the ground, as indicated in the 
response to the next question.

    Question. What criteria did the Peace Corps use to assess the 
safety and security of volunteers in the country? Please be detailed.

    Answer. In April of this year, Peace Corps security staff conducted 
an in-depth, on-the-ground assessment that focused on the conflict, 
terrorism, crime, environmental threats, and emergency planning. During 
the assessment, Peace Corps security staff met with U.S. Embassy 
officials, local and regional law enforcement, local partners, United 
Nations officials, and international non-governmental organizations. 
The 2022 assessment included significant travel in the areas around the 
Peace Corps regional offices in Jimma and Hawassa as well as the 
Butajira training site. Based on the information gathered during the 
assessment, the Peace Corps security staff recommended restricting 
volunteer travel and site placements to these regions in the southern 
half of the country, along with sites that could be supported out of 
the main Peace Corps office in Addis Ababa.
    Given that the overall security situation in the country changed 
after our assessment was concluded and the CN was submitted, the Peace 
Corps has paused the re-entry process. We have developed a series of 
decision points to assist us in monitoring developments on the ground 
to determine when and if conditions permit the return of volunteers. 
These include, but are not limited to, the successful implementation of 
the peace treaty, a prolonged and sustained ceasefire, resumption of 
humanitarian aid to the north, and withdrawal of Eritrean forces.
    I commit, if confirmed, to continued consultation with you, the 
Chairman, and your respective staff regarding the Peace Corps presence 
in Ethiopia.

    Question. There have been several public incidents presenting major 
safety and security concerns regarding Peace Corps volunteers. What 
steps has the Peace Corps taken in the last two years (since the global 
evacuation in March 2020) to address this short fall, and how have 
safety and security measures improved for those re-entering service? 
Please be detailed.

    Answer. The health, safety, and security of Peace Corps volunteers 
are the agency's highest priorities. The Peace Corps has traditionally 
operated in some very challenging environments across the globe, and 
the very nature of Peace Corps service entails risk. The Peace Corps 
approach to safety and security is an engaged partnership involving the 
agency, the volunteer, and the communities we serve. Each has a unique 
and important role to play in enhancing the safety of the volunteer.
    Therefore, we devote significant resources towards the training of 
our staff, community members and volunteers, a robust site selection 
process, and the implementation of comprehensive emergency response 
systems. We engage and coordinate closely with the United States 
Embassy in each Peace Corps country, as well as with our local and 
community partners who play a fundamental role in assisting our 
volunteers in identifying risks and adopting culturally appropriate 
strategies to enhance their own safety and security, reducing risk 
where possible.
    To ensure that the agency is ready to meet today's security 
challenges, the Peace Corps has made a number of systemic improvements 
to our safety and security tools including: enhancing our site 
development and site selection criteria; conducting a comprehensive 
review and update of our emergency action planning process; updating 
our global safety and security core training sessions; and rolling out 
a new security management system to track crimes committed against and 
services offered to volunteers. We have also devoted significant time 
to providing our onthe-ground Safety and Security Managers with 
training on these updates and we are providing applicants with crime 
data specific to their proposed country of service prior to service.

    Question. Sexual assault of volunteers continues to generate 
significant public and congressional attention. Thanks to the 2011 Kate 
Puzey Act and the Farr-Castle Act, the Peace Corps was given new tools 
to curb this scourge. Please explain the Peace Corps efforts to 
continue to combat sexual assault of volunteers in the field.

    Answer. The health, safety, security, and wellbeing of volunteers 
is paramount and lies at the center of all our operational decisions; 
any crime against a volunteer is one too many. Our work in sexual 
assault prevention, risk reduction, and response is rooted in the 
fundamental values of equity and human dignity. volunteers who are 
victims of sexual assault during their service receive extensive 
support as it relates to their safety, medical and psychological care, 
legal options, and continued service with the Peace Corps. This is a 
whole-of agency effort and our work to continuously improve the program 
is an agency priority.
    I am grateful for the support of Congress for the Peace Corps' work 
in this regard and particularly for the authorities provided in the 
Kate Puzey and Farr-Castle Acts. In fact, as Acting Director, I 
utilized the authorities provided by the Farr-Castle Act to exempt key 
personnel in the Office of Health Services, including our behavioral 
health team, from the time limits placed on career staff service under 
the Peace Corps Act.
    In March 2022, we released a roadmap, Peace Corps Commits to 
Broadening its Approach to Sexual Assault Prevention in New Brief and 
Roadmap, detailing the agency's commitment to further strengthening our 
systems, programming and approach to sexual assault prevention and to 
improving trauma-informed approaches to supporting survivors. This 
approach expands beyond the safety and security of individuals and 
takes into account the health, safety, and wellbeing of entire 
populations. With a public health lens, practitioners consider how 
context, norms, and social determinants impact behavior, such as 
perpetrating sexual violence.
    Since the evacuation, and in preparation for returning volunteers 
to service abroad, the Peace Corps rolled out a new post-level case 
management process that ensures our overseas staff proactively and 
formally review sexual assault cases, identify challenges and areas for 
improvement with every documented case, and confirm that all 
appropriate measures are followed. We have improved our systems to 
ensure that volunteers who experience sexual assault and request 
counseling services receive timely follow-up and care through 
telehealth services to ensure rapid access to clinical care. We have 
also enhanced orientation of host families, standardized vetting 
protocols, and implemented a number of new policies and procedures. 
This has included significant new training for post staff, including 
Peace Corps Medical Officers and Sexual Assault Response Liaisons.
    Earlier this year, the Peace Corps hired a Prevention Specialist 
who is currently developing a formal, comprehensive sexual assault 
prevention and response strategy by evaluating agencywide activities 
and applying promising practices and evidence-based research. The 
specialist is conducting a gap analysis and needs assessment to inform 
our overall prevention strategy.
    The intra-agency team has also prioritized and worked diligently to 
resolve all of the Office of Inspector General's outstanding 
recommendations related to sexual assault. The closure of each of these 
recommendations represents a new approach to enhance the safety and 
security of our volunteers.
    Sexual assault is a pervasive global issue, and it is every 
individual and organization's responsibility to do everything possible 
to prevent sexual violence, challenge norms, and provide trauma 
informed responses when it occurs. If confirmed, I commit to continuing 
to work with our Sexual Assault Advisory Committee to ensure that we 
are staying abreast of best practices and are implementing them 
consistent with the unique operating environments in which Peace Corps 
volunteers serve.

    Question. If confirmed, how will you engage with new countries who 
are asking for the Peace Corps to return to their communities?

    Answer. The Peace Corps serves at the invitation of the host 
governments from countries around the world. If confirmed, I will work 
closely with countries that have expressed interest in the Peace Corps, 
whether for the first time or to return to their communities.
    As part of the agency's Country Portfolio Review process, the Peace 
Corps regularly assesses and prioritizes potential new country entries 
based on preliminary reviews of safety and security conditions; quality 
of available medical care for volunteers; host country need; host 
country commitment and engagement; potential programmatic impact; and 
post management and cost.
    For selected countries, the Peace Corps Director authorizes 
discussions with the Department of State, other relevant U.S. agencies, 
and the host country government. A positive outcome from these 
discussions leads to a field-based, multi-functional assessment 
designed to answer two questions:


   Given the mission of the Peace Corps and its current portfolio of 
        country programs, should the Peace Corps open a post in the 
        identified country?

   Given sufficient resources and current agency standards and 
        practices, could the Peace Corps open a safe and effective 
        program in the identified country?


    After review of the assessment report, the agency holds 
consultations with the Department of State, the Office of Management 
and Budget, and other relevant agencies and sends a Congressional 
Notification to the appropriate Congressional committees prior to 
finalizing the decision to move forward with opening or re-establishing 
a Peace Corps program. The potential opening of a new post has 
budgetary implications that will be carefully considered in the context 
of the overall scope and scale of operations and as a part of those 
consultations.

    Question. There has been significant Congressional concern about 
the Peace Corps returning to closed and/or unsafe missions. Please 
explain the safety protocol for such decisions.

    Answer. Our top priority is returning volunteers to service 
overseas in a way that is safe for them, our staff, and the host 
communities in which they will live and work. That is why we developed 
and have applied a comprehensive re-entry strategy and assessment 
process that includes specific medical, security, programmatic, 
administrative, and logistical criteria that each post must meet prior 
to consideration for reentry. As a part of this process, the Peace 
Corps coordinates closely with post staff, host country partners and 
government officials as well as with our interagency partners.
    Volunteers have not been, and if confirmed I will continue to 
ensure they will not be, returned to a post that does not meet Peace 
Corps safety and security criteria.

    Question. Do you commit to informing Congress appropriately of any 
safety and security issues in a timely and efficient manner?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. What do you believe is the Peace Corps biggest challenge 
in 2023?

    Answer. The Peace Corps is returning to service following one of 
the most significant shocks to the global system in recent history. It 
is a liminal moment and one that requires every individual, 
institution, and country to reexamine their values, operating 
modalities and priorities. I believe our biggest challenge in 2023 will 
be attracting qualified applicants given the disruptions caused by 
COVID-19, ongoing economic uncertainty, and increased demand and 
competition for talent.

    Question. In your view, is the Peace Corps principally an 
international development program that also builds cultural ties within 
its areas of operation, or a cultural exchange program that also 
advances international development within its areas of operation?

    Answer. The beauty and strength of the Peace Corps' three goals, 
and a reason they withstand the test of time, is that they are so 
interdependent. Through its people-to-people model, the Peace Corps' 
development impact is not structured to drive large scale, short-term 
results. Rather, the Peace Corps' long-term development impact is 
linked to capacity building, leadership development, and the power of 
human connection. Diplomatically, the presence of Peace Corps 
volunteers living and working in communities around the world sends a 
powerful signal of friendship and goodwill.

    Question. The Peace Corps is funded by a direct appropriation, but 
also received significant levels of programmatic support through 
transfers from other agencies. If confirmed, how will you account for 
all of the funds managed by the Peace Corps?

    Answer. The Peace Corps manages interagency transfers consistent 
with the law and closely monitors, tracks, and reports all expenditures 
in accordance with federal accounting standards. For the 16th 
consecutive year, the external auditors issued an unmodified (clean) 
audit opinion on our FY 2022 financial statements. Funds received from 
other agencies are included in the Congressional Budget Justification 
as well as the Agency Financial Report, which demonstrates to the 
President, Congress, and the American public how fiscal funds entrusted 
to the Peace Corps have been used to achieve the agency's mission. If 
confirmed, I will ensure the Peace Corps' budget execution continues to 
be in compliance with the law and that we continue to be fully 
transparent in reporting of fiscal resources received and spent.

    Question. If confirmed, will you commit to ensuring full and 
complete compliance with current law, which prohibits the use of U.S. 
foreign assistance to perform or promote abortion as a method of family 
planning, support involuntary sterilizations, or lobby for or against 
the legalization of abortion overseas? Will you commit to ensuring 
volunteers are both aware of and compliant with these statutory 
restrictions?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. If confirmed, will you commit to ensuring that Peace 
Corps staff, country directors, and volunteers consistently uphold the 
highest ethical standards, including by holding them personally 
accountable for violations of U.S. and local law?

    Answer. Yes. In 2022 the Peace Corps updated its core expectations 
of both staff and volunteers. Volunteers are required to sign a 
statement acknowledging that they have received and will abide by all 
policies contained in their post's volunteer handbook, which includes 
the core expectations. Likewise, U.S. Direct Hire staff must sign a 
similar statement when they join the agency. All staff must complete a 
comprehensive onboarding course. The core expectations module is 
required to be taken within one month of joining the agency. Core 
expectations are reinforced throughout the life cycle of service and 
employment. Failure to comply with relevant policies and core 
expectations may result in disciplinary action up to and including 
termination.
    If confirmed, I commit to ensure that staff and volunteers 
consistently uphold the highest ethical standards as representatives of 
the Peace Corps.

    Question. As written in the (but not-yet-passed) Peace Corps 
Reauthorization Act (S.4466), there is currently a provision providing 
suspension without pay for any Peace Corps employee or volunteer who 
engages in serious misconduct. If confirmed, do you commit to adhering 
to this policy regardless if the Act becomes law? Please explain.

    Answer. The Peace Corps currently does not have the legal authority 
to suspend employees without pay pending investigations on cases of 
removal for misconduct. Unlike federal employees appointed under the 
various authorities of title 5 of the United States Code, Peace Corps 
employees are appointed under provisions of the Foreign Service Act, 
which does not contain the same broad authority. This is why I was 
grateful to see the suspension provision included in S. 4466. If 
confirmed, I commit to enforcing the legal measures available to the 
agency in cases where employees have engaged in serious misconduct and 
to working through due process requirements while ensuring prompt 
resolution of such cases.
    With regard to volunteers, they serve exclusively under terms 
established by the Peace Corps Act and agency policy and can be removed 
through internal processes that do not include any suspension (with or 
without pay). Volunteers are informed of these processes during their 
preservice training. If confirmed, I plan to remain committed to our 
agency's process of terminating the service of volunteers who engage in 
serious misconduct.

    Question. Please provide your views on virtual service and if such 
service will continue should you be confirmed.

    Answer. Soon after the evacuation of all volunteers in 2020, the 
Peace Corps began receiving inquiries from host country partners and 
evacuated Returned Peace Corps volunteers about the possibility of 
collaborating remotely. Committed to our mission and our returned 
volunteers and partners, the agency moved quickly to stand up a pilot 
initiative to match evacuated volunteers with partner requests for 
specific virtual support. We quickly learned that it was not only 
possible to support our partners and foster intercultural exchange and 
collaboration virtually, but that partner demand for virtual engagement 
was high and increasing.
    The Peace Corps Act provides the agency with legal authority to 
establish and conduct such pilot projects under 22 USC 2501(a) and 22 
USC 2502(a). Because the evacuated volunteers had closed their service, 
and were now private citizens, the agency determined that they could 
participate in the pilot initiative only by serving as donors of 
voluntary services to the agency, which the Peace Corps has the 
authority to accept under its existing gift acceptance authority, which 
is in 22 USC 2509(a)(4). The authority that the Peace Corps does not 
have, but that is included in the House version of the Peace Corps 
reauthorization legislation (HR 1456), is the ability to recruit 
individuals as Peace Corps volunteers who may conduct their volunteer 
service virtually from outside a host country. While the donor model 
has proved sufficient for virtual service proof-of-concept testing 
purposes, a more viable long-term mechanism would be to provide virtual 
service as a form of volunteer service. Authorizing the recruitment of 
volunteers for the purposes of virtual service would enable the agency 
to recruit, train, and manage them and their programmatic work through 
its established systems and allow us to meet our partners' requests.
    Since October 2020, when the Virtual Service Pilot was formally 
launched and after the relevant Congressional committees were informed 
of the effort in September 2020, the Peace Corps has had over 500 
Virtual Service Pilot Participants engaged in nearly 45 countries. 
Virtual service has enabled us to respond to the evolving needs of our 
host country partners, including requests for highly skilled volunteers 
like epidemiologists. It has also allowed us to remain active in places 
where it is currently unsafe to place volunteers on the ground. For 
example, there are currently 18 Virtual Service Pilot Participants 
supporting local partners in Ukraine. It has also been utilized 
effectively to pair an in-person volunteer with a highly skilled 
Virtual Service Pilot Participant.
    In addition to enabling us to support partners in new ways and in 
new areas, virtual service can reduce barriers to service and enhance 
the diversity of our volunteer corps by enabling Americans to serve who 
cannot pass medical clearance, or whose financial or family obligations 
prevent them from serving abroad for two years. It is also an 
opportunity for those who are unable to complete their in-person 
service, due to circumstances beyond their control, to continue to 
support their communities, where possible.
    To be clear, virtual service will never replace in-person service. 
Rather, virtual service can complement the in-person model, providing 
an option for Americans to serve who cannot do so in person, or where 
in-person service is impossible. I commit, if confirmed, to working 
with the Committee and Congress to continue to explore the 
opportunities presented by virtual service.

    Question. If confirmed, will you support the re-opening of Peace 
Corps Mission China? Please explain why or why not.

    Answer. The Peace Corps post in China is closed. If confirmed, I 
will not support reopening the post in China. High demand for the Peace 
Corps in other countries, as reflected in several formal invitations to 
open new programs, necessitates the use of the agency's limited 
resources to explore those options.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
           Submitted to Carol Spahn by Senator Jeanne Shaheen

    Question. The Peace Corps Reauthorization Act will provide the 
agency with its first funding increase in almost seven years. In March, 
the Peace Corps released a brief detailing the agency's commitment to 
strengthen its response to sexual assault for volunteers and returned 
Peace Corps volunteers.

   Can you provide an update on the implementation of the measures 
        outlined in the brief, such as the hiring of new personnel and 
        the development of more rigorous assault monitoring and 
        response resources?

    Answer. The health, safety, security, and wellbeing of volunteers 
is paramount and lies at the center of all our operational decisions; 
any crime against a volunteer is one too many. Our work in sexual 
assault prevention, risk reduction, and response is rooted in the 
fundamental values of equity and human dignity. Volunteers who are 
victims of sexual assault during their service receive extensive 
support as it relates to their safety, medical and psychological care, 
legal options, and continued service with the Peace Corps. This is a 
whole-of agency effort and our work to continuously improve the program 
is an agency priority.
    I am grateful for the support of Congress for the Peace Corps' work 
in this regard and particularly for the authorities provided in the 
Kate Puzey and Farr-Castle Acts. In fact, as Acting Director, I 
utilized the authorities provided by the Farr-Castle Act to exempt key 
personnel in the Office of Health Services including our behavioral 
health team, from the time limits on career staff service under the 
Peace Corps Act.
    As noted, in March 2022, we released a roadmap, Peace Corps Commits 
to Broadening its Approach to Sexual Assault Prevention in New Brief 
and Roadmap, detailing the agency's commitment to further strengthening 
our systems, programming and approach to sexual assault prevention and 
to improving trauma-informed approaches to supporting survivors. This 
approach expands beyond the safety and security of individuals and 
takes into account the health, safety, and well-being of entire 
populations. With a public health lens, practitioners consider how 
context, norms, and social determinants impact behavior, such as 
perpetrating sexual violence.
    Since the evacuation, and in preparation for returning volunteers 
to service abroad, the Peace Corps rolled out a new post-level 
(``post'' is the term for a Peace Corps office in a country) case 
management process that ensures our overseas staff proactively and 
formally review sexual assault cases, identify challenges and areas for 
improvement with every documented case, and confirm that all 
appropriate measures are followed. We have improved our systems to 
ensure that volunteers who experience sexual assault and request 
counseling services receive timely followup and care through telehealth 
services to ensure rapid access to clinical care. We have also enhanced 
orientation of host families, standardized vetting protocols, and 
implemented a number of new policies and procedures. This has included 
significant new training for post staff, including PCMOs and Sexual 
Assault Response Liaisons.
    Earlier this year, the Peace Corps hired a Prevention Specialist 
who is currently developing a formal, comprehensive sexual assault 
prevention and response strategy by evaluating agencywide activities, 
applying promising practices and evidence-based research. We are 
conducting a gap analysis and needs assessment to inform our overall 
prevention strategy.
    The intra-agency team has also prioritized and worked diligently to 
resolve all of the Office of Inspector General's outstanding 
recommendations related to sexual assault. The closure of each of these 
recommendations represents a new approach to enhance the safety and 
security of our volunteers.
    Sexual assault is a pervasive global issue, and it is every 
individual and organization's responsibility to do everything possible 
to prevent sexual violence, challenge norms, and provide trauma 
informed responses when it occurs. If confirmed, I commit to continuing 
to work with our Sexual Assault Advisory Committee to ensure that we 
are staying abreast of best practices and are implementing them 
consistent with the unique operating environments in which Peace Corps 
volunteers serve.

    Question. Is the Peace Corps prepared to execute some of the new 
funding the agency will receive to bolster support for sexual assault 
monitoring and response?

    Answer. The Peace Corps' agency-wide Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Response program (SAPR) incorporates best practices in the field and 
applies them to new, proactive training materials for volunteers and 
staff, and to new protocols and guidelines for preventing and 
responding to sexual assaults that are trauma informed and survivor 
centered. The agency is consistently evaluating the SAPR program, and I 
commit to ensuring it is funded to achieve its mission.

    Question. How is the Peace Corps ensuring a rigorous and inclusive 
recruitment process as volunteers return to service, and how is the 
agency ensuring that these volunteers are prepared to meet partner 
needs that continue to evolve as the world recovers from the pandemic?

    Answer. As a people-to-people development agency operating in a 
complex global environment, understanding and respecting other cultures 
while representing the diversity of the U.S. is crucial to the Peace 
Corps' success in fulfilling its mission to promote world peace and 
friendship. The Peace Corps will continue to prioritize the recruitment 
of, and support for, volunteers who represent the full diversity of the 
United States and who can support the development priorities of host 
communities.
    The Peace Corps' Office of Volunteer Recruitment and Selection 
(VRS) prioritizes attracting applicants that meet the needs of posts 
and the local communities we serve. To that end, we work to match 
potential volunteer skillsets with host community requirements. 
Recruiters work with applicants to successfully navigate and address 
each element of the application to be as competitive as possible. 
Furthermore, placement staff carefully review and assess each 
application to ensure they are invited to serve in a country where 
their skills and experience are best suited.
    One of our focus areas, as outlined in the agency's strategic plan, 
is to recruit and retain a volunteer cadre that reflects the diversity 
of America. To meet that goal, VRS is executing a targeted recruitment 
strategy designed to increase the Peace Corps' presence and awareness 
in underrepresented and underserved communities. Ultimately, this work 
will help build a pipeline of individuals from diverse backgrounds, who 
will become future Peace Corps volunteers. VRS fosters formal 
partnerships and pursues other engagement opportunities with 
educational institutions, including several Minority Serving 
Institutions (MSIs). This calendar year, VRS has placed an emphasis on 
greater engagement with smaller, often less resourced MSIs, to learn 
more about the needs of each institution and their unique student body. 
To this end, we are working to establish and sustain university 
partnerships that are instrumental to introducing the opportunities 
that exist in international service through the Peace Corps to diverse 
student audiences and prepare them for success in the application 
process and eventual service.
    At the interagency level, the Peace Corps also actively 
participates in the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational 
Equity, Excellence and Economic Opportunity through Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Through this initiative, the Peace 
Corps promotes service opportunities within the HBCU community by 
engaging directly with faculty and staff to develop and sustain 
mutually beneficial relationships.
    Additionally, VRS is working to build strong partnerships with 
organizations, institutions, and community groups that support and 
reflect the diversity of our nation. VRS is also working to develop and 
train the entire recruitment team to effectively recruit future 
volunteers from all backgrounds. This ensures that every Peace Corps 
recruiter has the language, tools, resources, and strategies necessary 
to successfully conduct outreach to underrepresented populations in 
communities across the nation.
    The agency is also working to attract Americans of all 
socioeconomic backgrounds to Peace Corps service, which requires 
intentional work to reduce financial barriers in the application 
process. In support of this effort, the Peace Corps has determined that 
applicants can be fully reimbursed for all eligible expenses required 
for medical clearance. Additionally, in calendar year 2023, the Peace 
Corps will conduct a barrier analysis as called for in our strategic 
plan and use the resulting data to determine how to identify and reduce 
barriers along the path to and through service, including socioeconomic 
ones.
    As the Peace Corps returns to service in an uncertain environment, 
I am committed to continuous review and evaluation of our strategies 
and structures to attract a robust and diverse cadre of volunteers.
    Peace Corps volunteers serve at the invitation of host countries, 
and volunteer projects and activities are host community-identified and 
community-led. As volunteers return to service abroad, they are 
supporting a range of COVID-19 response and recovery activities, such 
as combating COVID-19 mis- and disinformation; teaching good hygiene 
practices; and working with teachers to develop or pilot educational 
resources that mitigate educational disruption resulting from the 
pandemic.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
            Submitted to Carol Spahn by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. As we speak, the Party is 
cracking down on unprecedented student protests across the country. 
With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry, the CCP 
could stop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. The President made it clear in his National Security 
Strategy that the People's Republic of China (PRC) harbors the 
intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international 
order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its 
benefit. As Secretary Blinken said on May 26, the Administration's 
strategy is to invest in America, align with our allies, and compete 
with the PRC to defend our interests and build our vision for the 
future.
    Secretary Blinken also highlighted in his May speech the importance 
of diplomacy in building a shared vision for the future. One of the 
most powerful aspects of the Peace Corps model is that our volunteers 
are American citizens who live and work for two years within host 
communities. They learn the local language and customs, they work on 
projects that are co-designed by the communities, and they treat their 
hosts with dignity and respect.
    This builds enormous goodwill and has long-lasting--even 
generational--impacts. Foreign Ambassadors tell me what a powerful 
signal of friendship it is to see Americans in their communities, 
working in close partnership with host country citizens, and American 
Ambassadors regularly attest that the Peace Corps is the most cost-
effective, grassroots diplomacy the United States has.

    Question. Does the CCP undertake any activities that are beneficial 
to U.S. interests?

    Answer. Although the U.S. and the PRC are strategic competitors, as 
the President laid out in his National Security Strategy, the U.S. does 
not seek conflict or a new Cold War and can instead influence the PRC's 
behavior even while competing with them. Thus, the U.S. approach 
towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC where our interests 
and values differ and cooperating with them when they align.

    Question. Do you believe there are any areas within which the CCP 
would constructively work with the United States in good faith?

    Answer. Although the U.S. and the PRC are strategic competitors, as 
the President laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United 
States does not seek conflict or a new Cold War and can instead 
influence the PRC's behavior even while competing with them.Thus, the 
U.S. approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC where 
our interests and values differ and cooperating with them when they 
align.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China 
and the Peace Corps?

    Answer. The Peace Corps has closed its program in China, and if 
confirmed, I will not support reopening the program in China. The 
Administration's approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the 
PRC where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them 
when they align. If confirmed, I will support the Administration's 
policy on the PRC.

    Answer. The Peace Corps is an independent executive branch agency 
that sends American volunteers to developing countries to meet its 
mandate: promote world peace and friendship by improving the lives of 
those the volunteers serve; help others understand American culture; 
and share volunteers' experiences with Americans back home. More than 
241,000 volunteers have served in 143 countries since the agency's 
founding in 1961. In March 2020, COVID-19 led to the evacuation of 
nearly all volunteers then serving in approximately 60 countries. The 
Peace Corps continues to work on a reform agenda prompted by two 
separate congressionally-directed efforts at simplifying its 
recruitment process, establish periodic global portfolio review 
process, improvement on volunteer safety and health protocols, 
including reports of sexual assault of volunteers. The agency's annual 
funding has remained at approximately $410 million since 2016. The 
agency has not been fully reauthorized since 1999.

   How do you assess the success rate of the agency in addressing 
        volunteer concerns regarding overseas health and safety 
        concerns?

    Answer. The health, safety, and security of Peace Corps volunteers 
are the agency's highest priorities. The Peace Corps has traditionally 
operated in some very challenging environments across the globe, and 
the very nature of Peace Corps service entails risk. The Peace Corps' 
approach to safety and security is an engaged partnership involving the 
agency, the volunteer, and the communities we serve. Each entity plays 
a unique and important role in enhancing the safety of the volunteer.
    Therefore, we devote significant resources to train staff, 
community members and volunteers; have developed a robust site 
selection process; and have implemented comprehensive emergency 
response systems. We engage and coordinate closely with the United 
States Embassy in each Peace Corps country, as well as with our local 
and community partners who play a fundamental role in assisting our 
volunteers to identify risks and adopt culturally appropriate 
strategies to enhance their own safety and security, reducing risk 
where possible.
    The Peace Corps has developed a robust mechanism to track crimes 
committed against volunteers, and on an annual basis, each post (the 
term for a Peace Corps office in a country) engages in an in-depth 
review of both reported and non-reported crimes to identify trends as 
well as potential mitigation strategies aimed at preventing crime and 
reducing risk. Mitigation strategies are revisited throughout the year 
and revised as needed.
    In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Peace Corps has 
taken concrete steps to improve its capacity to anticipate and meet 
challenges associated with public health emergencies. These steps 
include establishing new and alternative medical evacuation options, 
devising specific protocols and emergency plans for volunteers to 
prevent or address infection, adapting medical clearance requirements 
to take into consideration COVID risk factors, and reengineering 
virtually every aspect of programming and operations to mitigate risk, 
wherever possible.
    The agency also recognizes the need for expanded mental health 
support for volunteers following the pandemic. The agency has enhanced 
our capabilities to provide coaching and support available to 
volunteers. The Peace Corps will rely on our decades of experience in 
emergency response to continuously monitor COVID-19 conditions and make 
informed decisions. If confirmed, I will continue to support these 
efforts with a keen focus on agility and adaptability, which have 
always been central to how the Peace Corps operates.
    Finally, the Peace Corps engages in a continuous quality 
improvement process in all aspects of our volunteer safety support 
systems to ensure that our focus and interventions are targeted and 
effective. In particular, we have done considerable work over the past 
two years to enhance our policies, procedures, systems and training. If 
confirmed, I commit to continuing to monitor and adapt our systems, as 
necessary.

    Question. What are the most important recent steps taken by the 
Peace Corps to enhance safety for volunteers?

    Answer. The health, safety, and security of Peace Corps volunteers 
are the agency's highest priorities. The Peace Corps has traditionally 
operated in some very challenging environments across the globe, and 
the very nature of Peace Corps service entails risk. The Peace Corps' 
approach to safety and security is an engaged partnership involving the 
agency, the volunteer, and the communities we serve. Each entity plays 
a unique and important role in enhancing the safety of the volunteer.
    Therefore, we devote significant resources to train staff, 
community members, and volunteers; a robust site selection process; and 
the implementation of comprehensive emergency response systems. We 
engage and coordinate closely with the United States Embassy in each 
Peace Corps country, as well as with our local and community partners 
who play a fundamental role in assisting our volunteers to identify 
risks and adopt culturally appropriate strategies to enhance their own 
safety and security, reducing risk where possible.
    To ensure the agency is ready to meet today's security challenges, 
the Peace Corps has made a number of systemic improvements to our 
safety and security tools including enhanced site development and site 
selection criteria; a comprehensive review and update of our emergency 
action planning process; updated global safety and security core 
training sessions; and a new security management system to track crimes 
committed against volunteers and the support services offered by the 
agency. The Office of Safety and Security at headquarters has invested 
significant time to train Safety and Security Managers at each post on 
the updated policies, systems, and operational changes. Additionally, 
the agency provides applicants with safety data specific to their 
proposed country of service, so that applicants can make informed 
decisions before accepting the invitation to serve.
    In 2021, the agency carried out a major enhancement of its 
information technology systems, by developing and implementing a new 
Site Incident Management System (SIMS), which allows the Peace Corps to 
better document and analyze crimes and specifically match them with 
individual sites to ensure that proposed sites do not have a history of 
crime incidents that would preclude placement of future volunteers. 
SIMS also enable the Peace Corps to provide a complete record of 
support and services provided to volunteers who experience any crime 
during service.

    Question. How successful has the agency been in hiring overseas 
medical staff?

    Answer. The Peace Corps has been able to hire candidates who meet 
the criteria set forth in the Farr-Castle Act (PL 115-256) through the 
agency's improved Peace Corps Medical Officer (PCMO) hiring process, 
using a variety of recruitment methods, robust interviewing process, 
and a rigorous credentialing process. The Peace Corps has been able to 
fill 100 percent of the PCMO vacancies with an average time from 
vacancy to start date of 7 months. The Peace Corps' credentialing 
policy establishes processes for the review and verification of the 
education, training, expertise, and license of PCMOs.
    The agency also developed a process to assess the health care needs 
of each post based on criteria, such as the number of volunteers and 
health care services available in the country. This ensures that health 
unit staffing (both PCMOs and support staff) accounts for the number of 
Peace Corps volunteers/Trainees, the health capacity of the country, 
and the number of medical accommodations.
    New PCMOs participate in an intensive mentoring process, whereby an 
experienced PCMO provides guidance to the new PCMO for a minimum of 
three months. New PCMOs also attend Overseas Staff Training where they 
receive an in-depth overview of key Peace Corps policies and 
procedures. Lastly, PCMOs receive an annual evaluation, which includes 
an assessment of their professional performance, clinical and technical 
skills, and they are required to obtain 50 hours per year of continuing 
medical education. In addition to the annual performance evaluation, if 
a PCMO's performance is deemed inadequate, their contract is 
terminated.

    Question. What skills, if any, do countries request most that the 
Peace Corps does not currently provide?

    Answer. Demand for the Peace Corps is strong and we are fielding 
requests for more volunteers, particularly in the area of English 
education. We have had countries request upwards of a thousand 
volunteers to have teachers in every school. In addition, we are 
receiving an increasing number of requests for highly skilled 
volunteers, which are managed by our relatively small, specialized 
Peace Corps Response Program.

    Question. Where do you see the greatest demand for new volunteers?

    Answer. As of December 2022, the Peace Corps has returned 
volunteers to service in 45 countries with approximately 900 volunteers 
on the ground. We are also excited that the inaugural cohort of 
volunteers recently arrived in Viet Nam--an historic first for the 
agency, and we have re-established a program in Kenya. Currently, the 
Peace Corps is issuing invitations for volunteers to serve in 11 
additional countries, bringing the total up to 56. The agency is also 
working to re-establish programs in Sri Lanka, El Salvador, and Solomon 
Islands. There is significant demand, not only from the countries that 
were evacuated in 2020, but also from countries around the world that 
have been impacted by COVID-19. These requests include countries in 
Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Central America, and the Pacific. 
Three Pacific island nations have formally invited the Peace Corps to 
return, in addition to Solomon Islands, and the agency is exploring the 
logistical, programmatic, and budgetary options for doing so.

    Question. How is the Peace Corps approaching its return to overseas 
operations?

    Answer. The Peace Corps has worked carefully and intentionally to 
return volunteers to service overseas in a way that prioritizes their 
safety and that of our staff and the host communities in which 
volunteers will live and work. That is why we developed a comprehensive 
re-entry strategy based on medical, security, programmatic, 
administrative, and logistical criteria that will allow the agency to 
determine when conditions are conducive to welcome volunteers back to 
service. We are in constant discussions with post staff, our host 
country partners, and interagency partners such as the Department of 
State. We began our return to service strategically slowly but have 
quickly ramped up to volunteers serving in 45 countries with about 900 
volunteers and invitations going out for 11 more countries.

    Question. Any unexpected issues with volunteers' returning to 
overseas locations since COVID began?

    Answer. The Peace Corps has worked carefully and intentionally to 
return volunteers to service overseas in a way that prioritizes their 
safety and that of our staff and the host communities in which 
volunteers will live and work. While the evolving nature of the 
pandemic is not without its challenges, the Peace Corps' cautious, 
adaptable, and pragmatic approach to re-entry helps to ensure the 
appropriate timing and cadence of volunteer return and their continued 
safety during their service. We have not had any unexpected issues but 
are constantly vigilant with volunteer safety.
    We are working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, U.S. Embassy partners, and host countries' Ministries of 
Health to determine each country's epidemiological status, readiness 
for volunteers to return, medical system, and ability to address health 
emergencies. We have also expanded our emergency medical capabilities 
by identifying alternative locations to evacuate volunteers in addition 
to our existing medical hubs, given border closures associated with the 
pandemic. To treat any COVID-19-positive volunteers with risk factors 
for severe COVID-19, the Peace Corps stocks Paxlovid (oral COVID-19 
medication) at every post. As anticipated, volunteers have tested 
positive for COVID-19 since returning to service; however, all 
individuals have experienced mild symptoms, and the impacts to the 
local community have been minimized, largely due to protocols and 
emergency plans in place.

          Submitted to Cynthia Dyer by Senator Robert Menendez

Trafficking of Cubans
    Question. For the last several years, the State Department has 
elevated concerns about trafficking practices related to Cuba's foreign 
medical missions, which are present in at least 20 countries, in its 
annual Trafficking in Persons report.

   As the State Department has noted, these medical missions employ 
        documented forced labor practices that subject Cuban doctors 
        and medical personnel to conditions akin to human trafficking. 
        What is your assessment of Cuba's foreign medical missions? Do 
        you believe they constitute forced labor? If confirmed, what 
        steps would you take to ensure the TIP Office can counter this 
        state-sponsored trafficking scheme?

    Answer. I understand the U.S. Government continues to have serious 
concerns about the human rights and labor rights of Cuban workers in 
labor export programs, including medical workers. Since 2010, the TIP 
Report has identified indicators of forced labor in Cuba's medical 
missions overseas, and over the last three years the Department found a 
policy or pattern that the Cuban Government profited from the labor 
export program amid strong indications of forced labor. If confirmed, I 
will work with allies to call out forced labor in this program and 
collaborate within the State Department to continue to press foreign 
governments and other international partners to protect Cuban workers, 
including medical professionals. I will encourage countries to put 
measures in place to prevent forced labor and proactively monitor these 
programs, given persistent allegations surrounding it.

    Question. Do you commit to support targeted foreign assistance 
programs to address the Cuban regime's foreign medical missions, use 
diplomatic channels to urge our allies and international partners to 
end their participation in such trafficking schemes, and to elevate the 
voices of victims of the Cuban regime's human trafficking within the 
TIP Office's work?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will encourage and work with civil society 
actors in countries with Cuban workers to assist this vulnerable 
population and share their concerns so that we can continue to 
understand the nuances of the Cuban labor export program and promote 
the voices of those who have been exploited in it. I will use 
diplomatic channels to shed light on the labor exploitation and forced 
labor of these vulnerable workers at the hands of the Cuban Government, 
and I will work diligently to ensure the Department continues to 
document allegations of forced labor in the annual Trafficking in 
Persons Report.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
          Submitted to Cynthia Dyer by Senator James E. Risch

    Question. What is your understanding of morale throughout JTIP 
Bureau?

    Answer. I understand that the morale in J/TIP is positive. As I 
said in my hearing, I am lucky to work on an issue that I am passionate 
about, and I know that J/TIP staff feel the same. I see that they are 
deeply dedicated to the mission of combating human trafficking. I am 
also aware of the strong support Congress has provided the TIP Office 
over the years, including through oversight and appropriations, which 
has strengthened the Office's mission and staff resolve. If confirmed, 
I will fully support staff professional development, training, and 
workplace flexibilities, in line with OPM and Department policies and 
directives, to ensure that morale in J/TIP remains high.

    Question. How do you intend to improve morale at JTIP Bureau?

    Answer. I see how dedicated the team at the TIP Office is to this 
work and that morale there is already positive. If confirmed, I would 
meet with the staff to understand ways they think we can further raise 
morale and improve their job satisfaction. For example, I might 
recommend a more formal long-term mentorship program within the office, 
potentially as part of the onboarding process, to help new employees 
develop as professionals. I would also look for ways to promote 
collaboration and connection amongst TIP Office staff, which I imagine 
was challenging during the pandemic and continues to be a factor as 
agencies adapt to hybrid work postures.

    Question. How do you intend to create a unified mission and vision 
at JTIP Bureau?

    Answer. If confirmed, I would work with the leadership team to 
ensure clarity of mission and vision across the office. I believe the 
TIP Office has a clear and important mission to which its staff is 
dedicated--combating human trafficking around the world. As the nature 
of human trafficking and TIP Office mandates and staff continue to 
grow, it is important to set clear priorities and unity of efforts to 
advance them. To that end, if confirmed, I intend to hold an offsite 
with the leadership team to clarify the office's priorities, mission, 
and vison for the next two years and the roles of each team. I would 
also extend that planning to all staff through an office-wide offsite 
to ensure unity and focus of purpose.

    Question. How would you describe your management style?

    Answer. I believe in a collaborative management style with both the 
supervisor and the employee playing an important role in the 
relationship. Supervisors should strive to be both professional and 
kind, willing to receive feedback and suggestions, and be both clear 
and realistic in their expectations and directions. Employees should 
seek to do their best work, display initiative and perseverance, and 
ask for assistance or clarity when necessary.

    Question. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to 
berate subordinates, either in public or private?

    Answer. No. It is never acceptable to berate subordinates, either 
in public or in private. This type of behavior is completely 
inappropriate and counter-productive.

    Question. How do you envision your leadership relationship with 
your deputy?

    Answer. If I am confirmed, I envision my relationship with my 
deputy to be one of mutual admiration and respect. I am incredibly 
fortunate to have a deputy with such deep institutional knowledge and 
experience in both the TIP Office and Department of State. I believe 
that our extensive, but different, experiences and talents will be 
truly complementary and that our combined leadership will be beneficial 
to our colleagues and to the Department.

    Question. If confirmed, what leadership responsibilities do you 
intend to entrust to your deputy?

    Answer. Rather than separating and delineating responsibilities 
between my deputy and I, I anticipate that, if I am confirmed, many of 
the most critical responsibilities and decisions will be made with a 
contribution from both of us. My deputy and I each bring extensive and 
different experience, and our combined perspectives will ensure a 
thoughtful decision for the most challenging priorities. If I am 
confirmed and we have the opportunity to work together, we will likely 
determine that some of the day-to-day responsibilities are more 
efficiently overseen by one or the other; however, I anticipate that we 
will be a united and complementary force for the most important 
decisions of the office.

    Question. In order to create and continue employee excellence at 
the Department, accurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) 
for Foreign Service Officers are imperative, though often lacking.

   Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with 
        accurate, constructive feedback on their performances in order 
        to encourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in 
        their roles?

    Answer. Yes, and I believe it is important to give this information 
immediately, whether positive or negative, rather than waiting to 
provide this information in the official performance reviews. Those 
reviews should truly be an opportunity to review the comments, 
encouragement, compliments, and coaching that have occurred 
continuously throughout the year. I believe both the supervisor and the 
employee play an important role in the management relationship. If the 
first time that an employee receives feedback, either positive or 
negative, is during the performance review, then the supervisor has not 
fulfilled their responsibilities.

    Question. If confirmed, would you support and encourage clear, 
accurate, and direct feedback to employees in order to improve 
performance and reward high achievers?

    Answer. I understand the critical role that clear, accurate, and 
direct feedback plays in performance management and employee 
recognition. If confirmed, I will support a culture of constructive 
feedback and accountability, and I will partner with TIP Office 
supervisors and human resources professionals to advance policies that 
support our staff. I would also ensure excellent performance and 
accomplishments are acknowledged and rewarded.

    Question. Some members of Congress and human rights groups have 
raised concerns that the TIP Report's ranking process lacks 
transparency and may be subject to political pressure. What are your 
views on these assertions?

    Answer. The annual TIP Report reflects the State Department's 
assessment of government efforts to meet the minimum standards for the 
elimination of trafficking in persons established under the Trafficking 
Victims Protection Act (TVPA). I understand the Department is committed 
to focusing on governments' anti-trafficking efforts under the TVPA 
minimum standards.
    If confirmed, I will support the TIP Office's dedicated staff in 
its efforts to gather and evaluate a broad range of information from 
foreign government officials, nongovernmental and international 
organizations, and a full array of open sources and to apply the 
minimum standards to each country as outlined in the TVPA.

    Question. If confirmed, how might you address these concerns and 
increase the perceived credibility and objectivity of the TIP Report 
findings?

    Answer. A country's tier ranking reflects the State Department's 
assessment of that government's efforts during the reporting period to 
meet the minimum standards under the TVPA. If confirmed, I will support 
the State Department's efforts to make the Report as accurate and 
objective as possible, documenting the successes and shortcomings of 
government anti-trafficking efforts assessed according to those 
standards applied consistently across the globe and to avoid making 
assessments based on political considerations. My goal will be to 
ensure that the annual TIP Report continues to be a thorough and fact-
based assessment. Maintaining its credibility will be a key priority 
among all my duties, if confirmed.

    Question. How will you respond to pressure from both within and 
outside the Department regarding country rankings?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will strive to ensure the TIP Report 
continues to be as objective and accurate as possible, and that tier 
rankings are based solely on a country's efforts to combat trafficking. 
Protecting the integrity of the TIP Report and its fidelity to the 
TVPA's minimum standards will also guide my recommendations to the 
Secretary regarding tier rankings. The TIP Report is the world's most 
comprehensive resource on governmental anti-trafficking efforts and 
remains the ``gold standard,'' accurately reflecting the 
characteristics and types of human trafficking that exist and the 
efforts governments are taking to combat the crime. If confirmed, I 
will work with officials across the Department to maintain this 
standard.

    Question. What is your sense of the TIP Office's relationship with 
the regional bureaus?

    Answer. I understand the State Department has dedicated staff 
working on human trafficking issues in Washington, including in the TIP 
Office and regional and functional bureaus, and at U.S. embassies and 
consulates around the world. I note the findings in last year's 
inspection of the TIP Office conducted by the Department's Office of 
Inspector General (OIG) found that stakeholders across the Department, 
including regional bureaus and overseas embassies, believe the office 
to be a collaborative partner and a leader in U.S. anti-trafficking 
efforts. If confirmed, I will strive to ensure that the TIP Office 
continues to work collegially and successfully with colleagues 
throughout the State Department.

    Question. In your view, does the TIP Office have sufficient 
institutional influence within the State Department?

    Answer. Yes. I believe the TIP Office has made great strides over 
the years to deepen relationships throughout the Department and to 
build support for a comprehensive, whole-of-Department approach to 
combating human trafficking. Specifically, I note the findings in last 
year's inspection of the TIP Office conducted by the Department's 
Office of Inspector General (OIG). The OIG found that stakeholders 
across the Department believe the office to be a collaborative partner 
and a leader in U.S. anti-trafficking efforts. If confirmed, I commit 
to continue the work of the TIP Office in this regard and further 
deepen alliances to combat human trafficking around the world.

    Question. Do you commit to accurately reporting the realities of 
trafficking and anti-trafficking efforts to Congress? Please explain 
your answer.

    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I fully commit to accurately reporting 
the realities of trafficking and anti-trafficking efforts to Congress. 
If confirmed, I will prioritize ensuring that the TIP Office's 
reporting, including through the congressionally mandated Trafficking 
in Persons Report, continues to objectively and accurately report the 
realities of trafficking and anti-trafficking efforts to Congress, 
through documenting both the successes and shortcomings of government 
anti-trafficking efforts around the world, including the United States.

    Question. What is your assessment of global anti-trafficking work 
and the subsequent U.S. response to fight traffickers globally?

    Answer. I believe the United States has always been a global leader 
in the fight against human trafficking, and the Trafficking in Persons 
Report (TIP Report), our multilateral work, and the use of our foreign 
assistance are some of the most important diplomatic tools we have. The 
Report helps us strengthen anti-trafficking efforts worldwide, shapes 
the TIP Office's foreign assistance priorities, and reflects the U.S. 
Government's commitment to global leadership on this issue, including 
by assessing its own efforts through the U.S. narrative. If confirmed, 
I will work to continue to strengthen U.S. leadership in these and 
other areas, including on ensuring survivors' expertise is integrated 
to improve anti-trafficking policies and programs and eliminating 
trafficking in government procurement.

    Question. Child Protection Compacts (CPCs) are a tool the J/TIP 
office has to further advance anti-trafficking work in country-specific 
contexts. What is your assessment of the program, and do you believe 
any/some of current CPC countries have met their thresholds under the 
original auspices of their agreements? Why or why not?

    Answer. CPC Partnerships are one of J/TIP's cornerstone programs. I 
understand close engagement with governments that have the political 
will to address child trafficking, longer performance periods that 
promote sustainability of efforts, and support to local civil society 
have advanced CPC Partnership objectives and supported partner 
countries in meeting the goals as defined in in the partnership. For 
instance, in Mongolia, improving interagency coordination was a key 
goal. I understand that within the first year of the partnership, civil 
society implementing partners worked with the government to establish 
the first Multidisciplinary Task Force on Trafficking in Persons which 
includes all relevant stakeholders.

    Question. The JTIP office produces one of the most important 
diplomatic tools each year, the Trafficking in Persons report. This 
report is invaluable to Congress in our various engagements each year. 
Do you believe this report could be improved? Why or why not? Does it 
provide a completely full picture of each country and their willingness 
to commit to anti-trafficking work?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with J/TIP to ensure the 
Trafficking in Persons Report continues to be the world's most 
comprehensive resource on governmental anti-trafficking efforts and 
remains the ``gold standard,'' accurately reflecting the 
characteristics and types of human trafficking that exist and the 
efforts governments are taking--a reflection of their will--to combat 
the crime. There is always room for improvement, and I will strive to 
ensure the Trafficking in Persons Report continues to be as objective 
and accurate as possible, and that tier rankings are based solely on a 
country's efforts to combat trafficking, consistent with the 
Trafficking Victims Protection Act.

    Question. Do you view aid restrictions to Tier 3 countries as an 
effective tool for encouraging the government of such countries to 
improve their anti-trafficking efforts? Why or why not?

    Answer. Congress created several tools to effect progress on human 
trafficking in the TVPA. Aid restrictions for countries on Tier 3 are 
an important one of those tools. I understand the President makes the 
determination to impose restrictions as a means to motivate governments 
to address human trafficking and to signal the importance of countering 
human trafficking, while carefully balancing other critical foreign 
policy priorities where it is in our national interest to continue 
providing assistance. I believe this tool is working. I understand many 
governments facing restrictions elevate their understanding and actions 
against human trafficking.

    Question. Please discuss the TIP Office's relationship with other 
departments and offices engaged in anti-trafficking programs. How 
effective are the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and 
Combat Trafficking in Persons (PITF) and Senior Policy Operating Group 
(SPOG) for encouraging interagency coordination to combat human 
trafficking?

    Answer. The PITF, composed of 20 agencies and departments, is the 
highest interagency body solely focused on advancing U.S. Government 
anti-trafficking efforts through a model whole-of-government approach. 
Its regular Cabinet-level meetings are effective action-forcing events, 
establishing priorities and commitments. I understand the TIP Office 
works with interagency partners throughout the year, supporting the 
work of the SPOG's committees and ad hoc working groups and 
collaborating on the U.S. narrative in the annual TIP Report. As chair 
of the SPOG, if confirmed, I will continue to bring together federal 
agencies to discuss timely, relevant issues for coordination to advance 
our anti-trafficking efforts across the federal government.

    Question. In your view, does the TIP Office have sufficient 
institutional clout and access across the interagency?

    Answer. My understanding is that the TIP Office has excellent 
relationships with its interagency partners. I note the findings in 
last year's inspection of the TIP Office conducted by the Department's 
Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that stakeholders across the 
interagency believe the office to be a collaborative partner and a 
leader in U.S. anti-trafficking efforts. As our understanding of human 
trafficking and its far-reaching impact on our lives and society grows, 
so does our need to leverage different agencies' expertise and 
resources and to promote efficiency and collaboration. If confirmed, I 
will work to advance those goals and preserve strong interagency 
relationships.

          Submitted to Cynthia Dyer by Senator Jeanne Shaheen

    Question. How can the U.S. continue to engage with Armenia to 
reduce their military and political reliance on Russia, while 
maintaining our ongoing commitment to peace in Nagorno-Karabakh?

    Answer. A strong, democratic Armenia will be in a better position 
to freely choose their own partners and allies. The assistance provided 
by the United States to support civil society, electoral processes, 
energy security, anti-corruption reforms, and trade expansion will all 
contribute to a stronger Armenia. State Department support for a 
durable peace agreement with Azerbaijan and normalization with Turkey 
seeks to broaden Armenia's options for economic and energy 
diversification.
    We regularly discuss security issues with Armenia as part of the 
U.S.-Armenia Strategic Dialogue mechanism, focusing on areas where we 
can help Armenia improve capacity and resilience to chart a more 
independent course. Our assistance fosters interoperability with U.S. 
and NATO forces, bolsters Armenia's international peacekeeping 
contributions, supports Armenia's Individual Partnership Action Plan 
with NATO, and assists with defense reforms. Under the State 
Partnership Program, the Kansas National Guard works closely with the 
Armenian military to build capabilities and interoperability with the 
United States.

    Question. The Collective Security Treaty Organization, or CSTO, has 
allowed Russia to retain influence in the post-Soviet sphere and 
develop its own regional military alliance, although I understand there 
are frustrations from the Armenian Government in how Russia has reacted 
to the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The U.S. must continue to 
work for a peaceful and lasting solution to this conflict.

   To what extent does the CSTO allow Russia to spread disinformation 
        and bolster its military presence in Eastern Europe, and how 
        can the U.S. and Armenia effectively engage to reduce these 
        malign influences?

    Answer. Armenia, like every other country--regardless of their 
geography or history--has the right to pursue its foreign relations as 
it chooses, in the furtherance of its own interests, and in accordance 
with international law. No country should attempt to undermine that 
right.
    Russia has utilized CSTO deployments and missions in member states, 
including Armenia, to create a perception of Russia being a good faith 
mediator to conflicts in the former USSR. The Kremlin creates and 
spreads disinformation in an attempt to confuse and overwhelm people 
about Russia's real actions in Ukraine, Georgia, and elsewhere in 
Europe. The United States Government continues to focus on rebutting 
and countering Russian disinformation and on shining a light on 
Russia's malign influence operations.

            Responses to Additional Questions for the Record
            Submitted to Cynthia Dyer by Senator Marco Rubio

    Question. In May, Secretary Blinken said that the People's Republic 
of China is the ``only country with both the intent to reshape the 
international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, 
military, and technological power to do it.'' The Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People's 
Republic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in 
Xinjiang, flood our communities with fentanyl, and emit by far the 
largest quantity of greenhouse gases. As we speak, the Party is 
cracking down on unprecedented student protests across the country. 
With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry, the CCP 
could stop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose.

   Is the CCP a threat to the United States?

    Answer. The President made it clear in his National Security 
Strategy that the People's Republic of China (PRC) harbors the 
intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international 
order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its 
benefit. As Secretary Blinken said on May 26, we will invest in 
America, align with our Allies, and compete with the PRC to defend our 
interests and build our vision for the future. If confirmed, I will 
continue to ensure that the Trafficking in Persons Report accurately 
records and assesses the human trafficking record of the People's 
Republic of China. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) 
requires the Department to make an objective assessment of government 
anti-trafficking efforts, not assessments based on political 
considerations. If confirmed, I will continue to urge the PRC to end 
all state-sponsored forced labor.

    Question. Does the CCP undertake any activities that are beneficial 
to U.S. interests?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors, as the President 
laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United States does not 
seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our allies and partners have an 
opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in a way that 
influences their behavior even as we compete with them. The United 
States' approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC 
where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them when 
they align. As recorded in the 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report, I 
understand the People's Republic of China initiated its first reported 
prosecution of a domestic case of trafficking without transnational 
elements since 2017 and approved a new national action plan for 2021-
2030. However, a government policy or pattern of widespread forced 
labor persisted. If confirmed, I will work with allies to highlight the 
PRC's complicity in human trafficking crimes.

    Question. Do you believe there are any areas within which the CCP 
would constructively work with the United States in good faith?

    Answer. Although we are strategic competitors, as the President 
laid out in his National Security Strategy, the United States does not 
seek conflict or a new Cold War. We and our allies and partners have an 
opportunity to shape the PRC's external environment in a way that 
influences their behavior even as we compete with them. The United 
States' approach towards the PRC focuses on competing with the PRC 
where our interests and values differ and cooperating with them when 
they align. If confirmed, I will continue to work with like-minded 
counterparts in governments and industry around the world to strengthen 
international efforts against the importation of goods produced by 
state-sponsored forced labor in the PRC and I will continue to consider 
all available tools and actions to promote accountability for those 
responsible for these abuses.

    Question. If confirmed, will you approve any joint activity with 
organizations or representatives from the People's Republic of China 
and the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking?

    Answer. As the United States National Security Strategy makes clear 
and as Secretary Blinken said in October, the People's Republic of 
China (PRC) is the greatest geopolitical challenge that we face because 
it is the only competitor with the intent and increasingly the 
capability to remake the international order. Beijing's actions suggest 
PRC officials have the intention to do so. If confirmed, I will work 
with NGOs and government representatives willing to undertake genuine, 
credible efforts to address human trafficking, including in the areas 
of prevention, protection, and the pursuit of criminal accountability, 
including for government officials. I will continue to look for ways to 
support civil society and diaspora organizations involved in holding 
the PRC accountable and protecting the victims of its state-sponsored 
forced labor campaigns.

    Question. Members of Congress, and human rights groups, have raised 
concerns that the TIP Report's ranking process lacks transparency and 
is subject to political pressure. For example, this year, in the 
Report's first annual list of ``State Sponsors of Human Trafficking,';' 
the People's Republic of China was ``inadvertently'' left off, until I 
released a statement and the Department subsequently corrected the 
report. This is especially egregious as the CCP's ongoing genocide and 
forced labor programs of Uyghurs most likely make it the worst 
perpetrator of human trafficking.

   If confirmed, how might you address these concerns and increase the 
        perceived credibility and objectivity of the TIP Report 
        findings?

    Answer. The annual TIP Report reflects the State Department's 
assessment of government efforts to meet the minimum standards for the 
elimination of trafficking in persons established under the Trafficking 
Victims Protection Act (TVPA). The Department of State is committed to 
focusing on governments' anti-trafficking efforts under the TVPA 
minimum standards.
    If confirmed, I will support the TIP Office's dedicated staff in 
its efforts to gather and evaluate a broad range of information from 
foreign government officials, nongovernmental and international 
organizations, and a full array of open sources and to apply the 
minimum standards to each country as outlined in the TVPA.

    Question. The U.S. has taken a range of policy actions in response 
to mass arbitrary detention and forced labor by the CCP in Xinjiang, 
including targeted sanctions, export controls, and import restrictions. 
Nonetheless, the 2021 TIP Report, state-sponsored forced labor was 
``intensifying'' in Xinjiang and ``increasingly prevalent'' in China. 
What additional steps, if any, should the U.S. take to combat human 
trafficking by the CCP?

    Answer. The United States must continue to take strong action to 
promote accountability for the PRC's actions and strengthen market 
defenses against the import of goods produced through forced labor in 
Xinjiang. If confirmed, I will continue to work with the international 
community to alert businesses and other entities to the reputational, 
economic, and legal risks of involvement with entities in or linked to 
Xinjiang. I will promote coordination efforts within international 
business specific to tracing supply chains and identifying high risk 
sourcing from companies linked to abuses in the Xinjiang region to 
support our shared interest of eradicating forced labor from global 
supply chains.

    Question. What is the proper role of the TIP Office in these 
efforts?

    Answer. The TIP Office works across the Department and with federal 
agencies and civil society to monitor allegations related to the 
Xinjiang region and respond to the priorities laid out in both the 
National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and the National 
Security Strategy. If confirmed, I will ensure that the TIP Office 
fosters and partners with a robust civil society that includes shelter 
organizations, direct service providers, watchdog groups, survivors, 
and nongovernmental organizations conducting awareness raising to end 
the use of forced labor in Xinjiang.

    Question. The Biden administration has waived security assistance 
restrictions for Child Soldiers Prevention Act-listed countries, 
allowing for the provision of hundreds of millions of dollars in 
otherwise restricted assistance. Critics contend that such waivers 
undermine U.S. efforts to deter countries from using child soldiers. 
Please describe the approach you would take toward issuance of these 
waivers, if confirmed.

    Answer. I understand that the President waives the Child Soldiers 
Prevention Act (CSPA) restrictions to motivate governments to cease the 
recruitment or use of child soldiers and, if applicable, their support 
to nongovernmental groups engaging in such practices. If confirmed, I 
would coordinate closely with colleagues in the Bureau of Democracy, 
Human Rights, and Labor, which is the bureau responsible for 
implementing the CSPA for the Department, to help inform the 
recommendations to the Secretary and President and ensure compliance 
with existing authorities.

    Question. Under what conditions might such waivers be appropriate? 
Would you advocate that frequency of waivers be generally decreased? 
Why or why not?

    Answer. After the publication of the Child Soldiers Prevention Act 
(CSPA) list in the annual Trafficking in Persons Report, I understand 
that the President decides whether to waive the CSPA restriction on 
affected security assistance on a case-by-case basis. The President is 
authorized to waive the CSPA restriction if he determines it is in the 
national interest of the United States and certifies that the 
government of the country is taking effective and continuing steps to 
address the problem of child soldiers. This year, I understand the 
President waived the CSPA restriction on the fewest number of 
governments since the initial enactment of the CSPA, with no full 
waiver provided to any country.

    Question. Oftentimes daylight is the best disinfectant, and the 
annual Trafficking in Persons report can serve to hold guilty parties 
or even other governments accountable. Can you point to any significant 
policy shifts in other countries that occurred as a result of being 
cited in the Trafficking in Persons Report?

    Answer. The Department uses the Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP 
Report) as a diplomatic tool to engage governments on trafficking. As a 
result, I believe governments around the world have strengthened anti-
trafficking efforts. I understand the TIP Report and the Department's 
sustained engagement helped Uzbekistan strengthen anti-trafficking 
efforts over the past five years, enough to progressively merit 
upgrades from Tier 3, Tier 2 Watch List, and now Tier 2. These efforts 
included taking substantive actions toward ending the use of forced 
labor of children and adults during the annual cotton harvest. In 2021, 
noted in this year's Report, many governments undertook renewed efforts 
to increase convictions, such as Ireland and Bahrain.
