items that have to be reauthorized by the committee, which 
includes a 5-year reauthorization of the FAA. It is also going 
to include a pipeline safety reauthorization and a Coast Guard 
reauthorization. In addition, the committee is going to address 
supply chain challenges and bottlenecks.
    We are also looking to provide oversight on the 
implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to 
make sure that the law is being followed. At the end of the 
year, we are going to begin working on a bipartisan Water 
Resources Development Act, or WRDA, for 2024. It is something 
that our committee has done every 2 years.
    As we advance our legislative agenda, it is important that 
we gather input from Members of Congress, as well as the 
stakeholders. Today, we are going to hear from our colleagues 
about the transportation and infrastructure needs, projects, 
and policies that are important to their districts.
    [Mr. Graves of Missouri's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Sam Graves of Missouri, Chairman, Committee 
                  on Transportation and Infrastructure
    Today, I look forward to Members sharing their policy priorities 
for the 118th Congress. The Committee has a busy and aggressive agenda 
this Congress that includes enacting commonsense policies for a more 
innovative, resilient, and efficient transportation and infrastructure 
network.
    Looking ahead to the next few months, we have multiple items that 
must be reauthorized by the Committee. This includes a five-year 
reauthorization of the FAA. We also will pass a pipeline safety 
reauthorization and a Coast Guard bill. In addition, the Committee will 
address supply chain challenges and bottlenecks.
    Throughout our busy schedule, we will continue our oversight of the 
Administration to hold it accountable for its policies. We are looking 
at the Administration's implementation of the Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act to make sure they are following the law. At the end of the 
year, we will begin working on a bipartisan Water Resources Development 
Act (WRDA) for 2024--something our committee has done every two years.
    As we advance our legislative agenda, it is important we gather 
input from Members of Congress as well as stakeholders. Today, we will 
hear from our colleagues about the transportation and infrastructure 
needs, projects, and policies important to their districts.

    Mr. Graves of Missouri. And with that I recognize Ranking 
Member Larsen for his opening statement.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. And the coffee is here just in 
time.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING 
     MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

    Mr. Larsen of Washington. I would like to welcome everyone 
to our Member Day hearing, which is an opportunity for our 
House colleagues to testify before the committee about 
transportation and infrastructure priorities that are most 
pressing for their constituents. Forty Members have signed up 
to speak before the committee today.
    The robust participation from Members on both sides of the 
aisle as witnesses today demonstrates, as the chairman and I 
have said many times, that transportation is bipartisan--in 
fact, nonpartisan. Instead, we work together on solving 
transportation and infrastructure challenges and creating 
economic opportunity for the people we represent.
    The enthusiasm of the Members seeking to testify today is 
not surprising. This hearing is happening at a very important 
time. After years of neglect, we are now seeing real and 
sustained investments in our Nation's roads, bridges, rail 
networks, airports, transit, and water infrastructure. The 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is delivering results for 
communities across the country. Ensuring that this committee 
continues to build on that success is essential. And the 
testimony that our colleagues deliver today will no doubt aid 
us in that effort.
    As I have said from the beginning of this Congress, the 
investments we authorize and oversee in this committee promote 
a cleaner, greener, safer, and more accessible transportation 
network; create jobs and opportunities for everyone; enhance 
our economic global competitiveness; build capacity in our 
communities; restore and protect our environment; and increase 
the safety of our transportation systems.
    More specifically, today's hearing will also help us inform 
our must-pass FAA reauthorization legislation, which is vital 
to maintaining a safe and competitive aviation sector. This 
bill offers an opportunity to enhance safety, protect and 
empower our aviation workforce, bolster consumer protections, 
and stimulate innovation. I am confident that ideas that we 
hear today will help us accomplish those objectives.
    So, I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your commitment 
to working in a bipartisan manner to see this legislation, as 
well as others, including the Coast Guard bill and pipeline 
safety that you mentioned, getting those over the finish line.
    Including a diverse range of perspectives is essential to 
ensuring the work of this committee and that we meet the needs 
of people from all across the country. Making sure Members can 
directly advocate for their districts is an essential part of 
this process.
    So, I want to thank all the Members who will be here today, 
and I am eager to hear the testimony. With that I yield back.
    [Mr. Larsen of Washington's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen of Washington, Ranking Member, 
             Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
    I'd like to welcome everyone to our Member Day Hearing, which is an 
opportunity for our House colleagues to testify before the Committee 
about the transportation and infrastructure priorities that are most 
pressing for their constituents. Forty members, both Democrats and 
Republicans, have signed up to speak before the Committee today.
    The robust participation from Members on both sides of the aisle as 
witnesses today demonstrates--as both the Chairman and I have said 
multiple times--that the issues before this Committee are bipartisan 
and nonpartisan. Instead, we work together on solving transportation 
and infrastructure challenges and creating economic opportunity for the 
people we represent.
    The enthusiasm of members seeking to testify today is not 
surprising. This hearing is happening at a very important time in our 
country. After years of neglect, we are now seeing real and sustained 
investments in our nation's roads, bridges, rail networks, airports, 
and water infrastructure.
    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) is delivering results for 
communities across the country. Ensuring that this Committee continues 
to build on that success is essential, and the testimony our colleagues 
deliver today will no doubt aid us in that effort.
    As I've said from the beginning of this Congress, the investments 
we authorize and oversee in this Committee:
      Promote a cleaner, greener, safer, and more accessible 
transportation network;
      Create jobs and opportunities for everyone;
      Enhance our economic global competitiveness;
      Build capacity in our communities;
      Restore and protect our environment; and
      Increase the safety of our transportation systems.

    More specifically, today's hearing will help inform our must-pass 
FAA reauthorization legislation, which is vital to maintaining a safe 
and competitive aviation sector. This bill offers an opportunity to 
enhance safety, protect and empower our aviation workforce, bolster 
consumer protections, and stimulate innovation. I am confident that the 
ideas we hear today will help us accomplish these objectives.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your commitment to working in a 
bipartisan manner to see this legislation, as well as others, including 
the Coast Guard authorization and pipeline safety, over the finish 
line.
    Including a diverse range of perspectives is essential to ensuring 
the work of this Committee meets the needs of people from across the 
country. Making sure Members can directly advocate for their districts 
is an essential part of this process.
    Thank you to all Members who have made time to come before the 
Committee today. I am eager to hear your testimony.

    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, Rick. I would like to 
welcome our witnesses and thank them, obviously, for being 
here.
    I don't think I have to explain the lights and the system 
to everybody.
    I would ask unanimous consent that witnesses' full 
statements be included in the record, and without objection, 
that is so ordered.
    As your written testimony has been made part of the record, 
the committee asks that Members limit their oral remarks to 5 
minutes.
    And given the number of Members that are appearing before 
the committee today, and out of consideration for our 
colleagues' time, I would ask unanimous consent that members of 
the committee be given 2 minutes to question each Member or 
witness following their statements.
    And without objection, that is also so ordered.
    And with that, our first panel--and we are going to have to 
make this fluid, because, obviously, not all Members are 
showing up when they need to. But our first panel is supposed 
to be Kevin Hern, Brian Higgins, Greg Landsman, and Nick 
Langworthy. So, we will go ahead and start.
    We will just go left to right.
    Nick, why don't you go ahead and start.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. NICHOLAS A. LANGWORTHY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK

    Mr. Langworthy. Well, thank you to Chairman Graves and to 
my colleagues for the opportunity to address you today.
    The work that you do on the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee is essential to keeping America 
running. The reauthorization of the FAA is a critical part of 
this, and I wanted to take this opportunity to voice my 
vehement support for keeping the 1,500-hour pilot rule 
completely intact.
    This mandatory training requirement was put in place 
following the crash of flight 3407 that happened in my district 
in suburban Buffalo in the town of Clarence, New York. All 49 
passengers on board, in addition to 4 crewmembers and a 
resident of the home at the site of the crash, were killed. We 
can never get back those lost souls, but we must do everything 
in our power to prevent another tragedy.
    As you know, the law requires airline first officers to 
have 1,500 hours of flight experience to earn an airline 
transport pilot certificate. In addition, it allows FAA to give 
flight experience credit towards the 1,500-hour flight 
requirement for specific academic and military training, 
further enhancing safety. Now, since these training 
requirements were implemented, there hasn't been a single 
American commercial airline crash, and we want to keep it that 
way.
    I am here today because there is a movement among some to 
make changes to these requirements, and it must be said 
unequivocally that no business decision should ever come before 
public safety. Period. And when Americans book that plane 
ticket to work or to go on a family vacation, we need to have 
100 percent confidence in the airline and its pilots.
    I know the airline industry is facing the same challenges 
as every other industry in serious workforce shortages. But 
loosening lifesaving qualifications is not the place to close 
that workforce gap. The healthcare industry is facing the same 
challenges, but you wouldn't trust someone to operate on you 
who doesn't have the requisite skills or training.
    And I know there is a big push from regional carriers to 
allow flight simulation training to count towards these hours. 
It is just not the same as real-life, in-the-air flights, where 
you know your safety and the safety of everyone on board is 
dependent on the decisions you make. There is no way to truly 
simulate how your mind and body responds to in-the-air 
challenges.
    We all remember the shocking and heroic story of pilot 
Sully Sullenberger. He landed a U.S. Airways flight on the 
Hudson River after bird strikes took out both engines. All 155 
passengers were saved and survived. They called it ``the 
miracle on the Hudson,'' but it was not. It was much more than 
a miracle. It was because Sully was an expertly experienced 
pilot who knew how to make difficult decisions in the case of 
an emergency. And his training took over to bring everyone to 
the ground safely.
    Computer training cannot accurately prepare you for a life 
or death decision in the air. You wouldn't let your 16-year-old 
who has mastered a NASCAR video game go out and drive in 
horrible weather conditions.
    So, we need to do everything in our power to protect these 
training requirements. And I have pledged to the families of 
flight 3407, along with my colleague from Buffalo, 
Representative Higgins, and all Americans who use air travel 
that I will fight to protect their safety.
    This is a bipartisan issue, and I am proud to work with my 
colleagues across the aisle to ensure that these training hours 
remain in place as is. We owe it to the victims to do 
everything in our power, and the airlines, large and small, owe 
it to their customers who are entrusting them with their lives.
    So, thank you very much for your time, and I yield back.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. BRIAN HIGGINS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK

    Mr. Higgins of New York. Thank you, Chairman Graves and 
Ranking Member Larsen.
    As my colleague, Nick Langworthy, has outlined, on February 
12th of 2009, there was a fatal crash in Clarence Center, 
killing 49 people on board and 1 on the ground.
    That evening I was here in Washington, and I called then-
Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, who informed me that 
the National Transportation Safety Board would be on the ground 
first thing in the morning. And they are very, very good with 
their detailed investigations, including the use of forensics, 
to determine what the cause of this terrible tragedy was.
    The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that 
this was an avoidable crash, that it was pilot error, which was 
primarily responsible for this tragedy. The pilots did the 
exact opposite of what they should have done, based on the 
training that they should have received. Then and only then did 
we really realize that there were two levels of safety: one for 
the larger commercial carriers and a different one for the 
regional carriers.
    And the families of the victims got involved with this 
issue. They educated themselves. They were very consistent, and 
they were very clear about taking what the National 
Transportation Safety Board had concluded and turning that into 
a Federal aviation safety act with many, many provisions, 
including the minimum pilot training hours of 1,500 hours. They 
included addressing issues of pilot fatigue, which was a 
contributing factor to the flight 3407 tragedy; consumer 
transparency; the pilot records database--one of the pilots, 
the captain, actually had a history of problems that under 
normal circumstances would have precluded that individual from 
piloting a plane; and the pilot training requirements like the 
1,500-hour rule.
    As my colleague, Congressman Langworthy, has stated--and we 
have stated throughout--since 2010, commercial aviation 
fatalities have been reduced by 99.8 percent. Since 2010, 
commercial aviation fatalities have been reduced by 99.8 
percent.
    But this year, as the FAA reauthorization process 
continues, some are calling for the hard-fought 1,500-hour 
pilot training rule into question. Again, there was precedent 
for this, and it is something that we were not aware of before 
this crash, that the regional carriers were subject to a less 
arduous pilot training regimen. These changes could prioritize 
special interests over passengers. SkyWest Airlines is the 
latest airline attempting to circumvent these critical flight 
safety standards.
    So, we are just here, both Congressman Langworthy and I, in 
a bipartisan effort on behalf of the flying public to ensure 
that this extraordinary record of a reduction of 99.8 percent 
in fatalities continue. And a watering down, a circumvention of 
those rules would put into jeopardy the flying public and their 
best interests moving forward.
    Just to conclude, the families of flight 3407--the 
victims--will be here this week. They will testify before your 
committee. And the one thing that stuck out to me: Right after 
the crash, they came here collectively, and spoke with one 
voice, and they said that they didn't blame the pilots. They 
blame the system that allowed the pilots who were not qualified 
to get into the cockpit and fly that plane which was the cause 
of this terrible tragedy. And they have committed themselves 
since that time, not because they can bring their own people 
back, their daughters, their sons, their husbands and wives, 
but they could keep future families from having to deal with 
the grief and the tragedy that they have had to endure since 
this tragic accident occurred many years ago.
    So, we thank you for your consideration of our testimony, 
and we ask you to please, please take into consideration the 
basis from which these recommendations were made, and that is 
to the hard work of the National Transportation Safety Board 
and the families of the victims. Thank you.
    [Mr. Higgins of New York's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Brian Higgins, a Representative in Congress 
                       From the State of New York
    Thank you, Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, for allowing 
me the opportunity to testify today.
    On February 12, 2009, Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed in my 
community of Western New York, killing everyone on board and one on the 
ground.
    In the aftermath of the crash an investigation conducted by the 
National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the tragic accident 
was avoidable and caused by pilot error.
    The victims' families did not blame the pilots themselves, because 
they were victims too. They blamed the system that allowed inadequately 
trained pilots to fly our commercial planes.
    Following the tragedy, the Families of Flight 3407 turned their 
pain and sadness into action, fighting tirelessly to deliver flight 
safety reforms in the Federal Aviation Administration Act of 2010.
    This included measures addressing pilot fatigue, consumer 
transparency, the pilot records database, and pilot training 
requirements, like the 1,500-hour training rule.
    These regulations were put in place 14 years ago and as a result 
our skies have never been safer.
    Since 2010 commercial aviation fatalities have been reduced by 
99.8%.
    But this year as the FAA Reauthorization process continues, some 
are calling the hard-fought 1,500-hour pilot training rule into 
question.
    These changes could prioritize special interests over passengers.
    SkyWest Airlines is the latest airline attempting to circumvent 
these critical flight safety standards. If their application before the 
Department of Transportation is approved, their operations would be 
reclassified to conduct scheduled passenger operations as a commuter 
air carrier.
    This example, if unchecked and unchallenged, will pave the way for 
other regional airlines to operate at substantially lower safety 
standards by using substantially less trained first officer pilots.
    This week I wrote a bipartisan letter with my Western New York 
colleague Congressman Nick Langworthy urging U.S. Transportation 
Secretary Pete Buttigieg and the US Department of Transportation to 
deny their request.
    Protecting the 1,500-hour pilot training rule isn't a partisan 
issue, it's about maintaining the safety of our air space.
    There are many components to flight safety training.
    Pilots learn how to obtain a weather report and use it to plan how 
much fuel is needed, they develop and file the safest and most 
efficient flight safety plan, and they read the Notice to Air Missions 
(or NOTAMs).
    Pilots also perform preflight inspections on the aircraft itself, 
making sure that the landing gear, doors, and other equipment are up to 
standard.
    As a pilot himself, I'm sure Chairman Graves understands that 
student pilots do not gain this experience using flight simulators 
alone.
    These are safety habits learned through many hours of real flight 
experience that pilots gain under the current training procedures.
    If Congress is not pushing industry to the highest and most 
rigorous levels of training, with strict scrutiny on any training that 
minimizes real flight experience, we risk abridging the safety 
standards that we know have worked.
    The flight 3407 crash was preventable.
    I have stood by flight 3407 families from the beginning as they 
fought to ensure that no other families or communities experience a 
tragedy like that one that took place in Clarence, New York.
    I will continue to do so anytime their goals are at risk.
    As hearings and debate continue regarding the 2023 Federal Aviation 
Administration Reauthorization Act, I urge this Congress leave these 
safety and training standards intact.
    Every American that steps on a plane deserves the peace of mind 
that there is one level of safety among all US airlines.
    These standards are commonsense, and they must remain in place for 
the safety of the Western New York community and all others across the 
United States.

    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Harriet.

   TESTIMONY OF HON. HARRIET M. HAGEMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
               CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WYOMING

    Ms. Hageman. Yes, good morning. Thank you, Chairman Graves 
and Ranking Member Larsen, for welcoming me before your 
committee today. The issues within your jurisdiction are 
incredibly important to the State of Wyoming, our businesses, 
and our citizens. And I appreciate the opportunity to discuss 
our priorities.
    Unfortunately, I come with an issue of great concern for 
multiple sectors of the Wyoming economy. This is the poor 
status quo of Western rail service, which is deteriorating even 
further. The reality is that Wyoming no longer has reliable 
rail service. One agenda item on this hearing's notice of 
meeting is addressing the supply chain and energy crises. The 
Wyoming situation, unfortunately, fits perfectly within this 
category.
    We have two rail companies that provide freight rail 
service to Wyoming. Together their trains service our coal 
mines in the Powder River Basin, trona mines in the southwest, 
bentonite operations across the State, as well as agricultural 
producers and more.
    Nearly 20 percent of the Nation's electricity comes from 
coal, and Wyoming is the top coal producer in the country, 
producing 40 percent of the Nation's coal. Without Wyoming 
coal, the lights literally do not come on. Yet the Powder River 
Basin, where a large percentage of our coal is produced, 
witnessed severe disruptions to reliable rail service.
    In 2022, estimates from the Wyoming Mining Association show 
that the State of Wyoming lost roughly $100 million in revenue, 
with about 50 million tons of coal not being shipped from our 
mines because train service slowed and, in some instances, the 
trains did not show at all. This is $100 million that was not 
available for our schools, our budget reserve account, or for 
other State expenditures in Wyoming. And this doesn't count the 
losses to the Federal Treasury, as much of this coal is 
federally owned.
    While early 2023 train numbers have been better, they are 
still not completely restored, and there is no end in sight. We 
must be able to ensure stable and consistent train service in 
Wyoming. One large coal company in Wyoming saw the variance of 
their shipments from the second quarter of last year through 
the first quarter of 2023, down over 7 million tons from what 
was expected and nominated to its customers. Another saw its 
quarterly average shipments drop by millions, as well. And yet 
another witnessed shipments decreasing by millions. During one 
particular cold snap, the mines were expecting 18 trains a day, 
and the number of trains dropped to just 1. Other mines had 
days during the same period where no trains arrived at all. 
Now, severe winters in Wyoming are nothing new, but a lack of 
train service is.
    These are the Nation's top coal producers, with both 
eastern and western operations. Many of these companies report 
that they have been able to reach a resolution for the reduced 
service issues related to their eastern operations, but have 
found little to no relief in their western operations, 
including in Wyoming.
    Another major concern for our coal producers is that, up 
until recently, the Surface Transportation Board's Rail Energy 
Transportation Advisory Committee, which is supposed to have 
three coal producers, had none, essentially silencing this 
critically important voice.
    Another sector seeing reduced service is our industrial 
minerals. Soda ash is Wyoming's top international export, yet 
our producers are reporting that their rail service is the 
worst it has ever been. If we cannot deliver soda ash to 
customers, they will turn to our synthetic soda ash competitor, 
which is China. Such a development would be disastrous for 
Wyoming and the country.
    This is not from just the mining industry. Wheat and barley 
growers in our State have come to me not just to discuss the 
farm bill, but rail issues. In the Bighorn Basin, some ag 
producers rely more on rail to move their crops than they do 
trucks. Agricultural inputs have also been jeopardized. 
Fertilizer prices have already skyrocketed and hurt our farmers 
in my State and across the country. Yet in 2022, rail providers 
began metering traffic in a manner further threatening reliable 
access to these agricultural resources.
    [Chart shown.]
    Ms. Hageman. What I have just laid out before the committee 
this morning can be seen on the graph behind me. Since 2004, 
U.S. Class I rail volumes have remained stagnant or declined, 
while its profits have increased exponentially.
    Rail issues come and go from the national news based on 
events happening around the country. Unfortunately, this is a 
constant burden for Wyoming, and one aspect of the railroad 
issue that is not often covered in the media.
    I am concerned because access to reliable rail has all but 
disappeared in my State. My concern is heightened by the fact 
that there seems to be solutions in the East with a worsening 
situation in the West, a geographic area that may not be well 
known to the entirety of the country, but many of whom, whether 
they know it or not, rely on my State for their energy and food 
needs.
    With that being said, I thank the committee for welcoming 
me into the room today to discuss this ever-growing issue for 
my State, and I also want to thank Mr. Nehls for leading the 
subcommittee overseeing rail. I have the great pleasure of 
serving with him on the Judiciary Committee and look forward to 
working with all of you on this incredibly important issue. 
Thank you.
    [Ms. Hageman's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
  Prepared Statement of Hon. Harriet M. Hageman, a Representative in 
                   Congress From the State of Wyoming
    Thank you Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen for welcoming 
me before your committee today. The issues within your jurisdiction are 
incredibly important to the State of Wyoming, our businesses, and our 
citizens, and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss our priorities.
    Unfortunately, I come with an issue of great concern for multiple 
sectors of the Wyoming economy. This is the poor status quo of Western 
rail service which is deteriorating even further. Wyoming no longer has 
reliable rail service.
    One agenda item on this hearing's notice of meeting is Addressing 
Supply Chain and Energy Crises. The Wyoming situation, unfortunately, 
fits perfectly within this category.
    BNSF and Union Pacific provide freight rail service to Wyoming. 
Together, their trains service our coal mines in the Powder River 
Basin, trona mines in the southwest, bentonite operations across the 
state, as well as agricultural producers, and more.
    Nearly 20% of the nation's electricity comes from coal. Wyoming is 
the top coal producer in the country, producing 40% of the nation's 
coal. Without Wyoming coal, the lights literally do not come on.
    Yet, the Powder River Basin, where a large percentage of our coal 
is produced, witnessed severe disruptions to reliable rail service. In 
2022, estimates from the Wyoming Mining Association show that the State 
of Wyoming lost roughly $100 million in revenue, with about 50 million 
tons of coal not being shipped from our mines because train service 
slowed, and in some instances, the trains did not show at all.
    This is $100 million that was not available for our schools, our 
Budget Reserve Account, or for other state expenditures in Wyoming. And 
this doesn't count the losses to the federal treasury, as much of this 
coal is federally owned.
    While early 2023 train numbers have been better, they are still not 
completely restored and there is no end in sight. We must be able to 
ensure stable and consistent train service to Wyoming.
    One large coal company in Wyoming saw the variance of their 
shipments from the 2nd quarter of last year through the first quarter 
of 2023 down over 7 million tons from what was expected and nominated 
to its customers.
    Another saw its quarterly average shipments drop by millions. Yet 
another witnessed shipments decreasing by the millions. During one 
particular cold snap, mines expecting 18 trains a day dropped to just 
one. Other mines had days during the same period where no trains 
arrived at all. Severe winters are not new to Gillette, just the 
reduced rail service.
    These are the nation's top coal producers, with both eastern and 
western operations. Many of these companies report that they have been 
able to reach a resolution for the reduced service issues related to 
their eastern operations, but have found little to no relief in their 
Western operations.
    Another major concern for our coal producers is that up until 
recently, the Surface Transportation Board's Rail Energy Transportation 
Advisory Committee, which is supposed to have 3 coal members, had none, 
essentially silencing this critically important voice.
    Another sector seeing reduced service is our industrial minerals. 
Soda ash is Wyoming's top international export, yet our producers are 
reporting that their rail service is the worst it has ever been.
    If we cannot deliver soda ash to customers, they will turn to our 
synthetic soda ash competitor, China. Such a development would be 
disastrous for Wyoming.
    This is not from just the mining industry. Wheat and barley growers 
in our state have come to me to not just discuss the Farm Bill, but 
rail issues. In the Big Horn Basin, some ag producers rely more on rail 
to move their crops than they do trucks.
    Agricultural inputs have also been jeopardized. Fertilizer prices 
have already skyrocketed and hurt farmers in my state and across the 
country. Yet, in 2022 rail providers began metering traffic in a manner 
further threatening reliable access to these agricultural resources.
    Rail issues come and go from the national news based on events 
happening around the country. Unfortunately, this is a constant burden 
for Wyoming and one aspect of the railroad issue that is not often 
covered in the media.
    I am concerned because access to RELIABLE rail has all but 
disappeared in my state. My concern is heightened by the fact that 
there seems to be solutions in the east, with a worsening situation in 
the west--a geographic area that may not be well known to the entirety 
of the country, but many of whom, whether they know it or not, rely on 
my state for their energy and food needs.
    With that being said, I thank the Committee for welcoming me into 
the room today to discuss this ever growing issue for my state. I also 
want to thank Mr. Nehls for leading the Subcommittee overseeing rail. I 
have the great pleasure serving with you on the Judiciary Committee and 
look forward to working with you on another critical issue.
    I look forward to helping this Committee study and oversee this 
issue more so we can collaboratively determine the scope of the issue, 
the causes, and find legislative solutions to provide relief for all of 
Wyoming and others who are suffering from this worsening issue.

    Mr. Graves of Missouri. We are going to back up real quick, 
so that we are able to dismiss Members. So, we will do 
questions as each Member testifies.
    So, questions for Mr. Langworthy, and I have one.
    Can you tell the committee how the 1,500-hour rule would 
have prevented the accident in Buffalo?
    Mr. Langworthy. Well, the NTSB had concluded it was pilot 
error. And we learned some very troubling facts after the 
crash. The one pilot was regularly getting 5 hours of sleep at 
night. They were overworked. They had had under 500 hours of 
in-flight training, and the person had to work a second job as 
a barista at the same time.
    The standard, once it was put in place--and it was a 
unanimous vote in Congress that put the 1,500-hour flight 
requirements in place--I think the data speaks for itself. 
There has not been a single commercial aviation crash and 
fatality since that moment, and it has gone an awful long way 
to making the flying public more comfortable with who is 
actually flying your plane.
    I mean, we live this in western New York because I know the 
people that lost loved ones, children, fathers. And to sit 
across the table from those that lost a loved one because of an 
underqualified pilot is a very difficult thing.
    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Both pilots had over 1,500 hours in 
that accident. And to correct for the record, too, it was not a 
unanimous vote within Congress. I know that for a fact. I was 
there. But both pilots had over 1,500 hours. So, to say that 
1,500 hours is going to correct this, it wouldn't have 
corrected it in Buffalo.
    And I do take a little bit of--I do have a problem with 
stating that simulation is a poor substitute for actually 
flying, because in a simulator, you can simulate anything. You 
can simulate any situation, any problem, any mechanical 
failure. You can't do that in real life. And saying that a 
pilot has to have 1,500 hours--which means they are going to go 
out and rent a Cessna and just circle in the sky--is not the 
kind of training that we need for our airline pilots.
    I wish Mr. Higgins was here to address that, as well.
    Does anybody else have any questions for Mr. Langworthy? 
And then we will go to Harriet.
    [No response.]
    Thank you, Mr. Langworthy, for being here, Mr. Higgins for 
being here.
    And Harriet, we will go to you real quick, and then we will 
just move on down, and then you all can leave as we finish up.
    So, any questions for Representative Hageman?
    Seeing none, thank you for coming in.
    Ms. Hageman. Thank you for having me.
    Mr. Graves of Missouri. I appreciate it.
    So, now we will go to Mr. Hern. Five minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. KEVIN HERN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM 
                     THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA

    Mr. Hern. Thank you, Chairman Graves and the members of the 
T&I Committee for hosting this Member Day. I appreciate the 
opportunity to share my concerns about the FAA.
    I have been flying for 42 years, with thousands of hours of 
experience in the air and several licenses, certificates, and 
ratings. I have had extensive conversation with a great deal of 
individuals within the aviation industry and the issues they 
face with the FAA.
    I am here to speak about the aviation community's 
displeasure with inconsistency in the Flight Standards District 
Offices, more commonly known in the industry as FSDOs, and the 
ongoing pilot shortage. I have heard from multiple sectors in 
the aviation community, from heavy-lift helicopter operators to 
aircraft repairmen, about the serious lack of consistency from 
FSDOs.
    It is a common complaint that each FSDO office and 
inspector interprets and administers the rules set forth by the 
FAA. There are 77 FSDO offices operating in the United States, 
meaning that there are 77 different possible ways that rules 
and regulations can be interpreted. And that doesn't even 
account for the individual inspectors at each FSDO interpreting 
rules in their own way.
    If Federal oversight is going to happen, there needs to be 
a consistent application of the rules and regulations across 
the board. The aviation community is frustrated about FAA 
claims that they oversee safety and regulatory standards across 
the entire U.S., when in reality there is a complete disconnect 
between the FAA office in Washington, DC, and individual FSDOs. 
FSDOs are meant to be a resource to the aviation community, but 
instead they have just become unhelpful with their inconsistent 
guidance and burdensome certification processes.
    This is not a new issue. Those in the aviation industry 
have been asking Congress to look into the FSDO inconsistencies 
since the early 2000s. It is time we get to the root of the 
issue, and demand the FAA finally take control and create 
consistency within their FSDOs. At the end of the day, if the 
FAA is going to operate at a Federal level, they must ensure 
all FSDOs interpret rules and safety standards equally, 
treating and regulating everyone the same way from FSDO to 
FSDO.
    Pilot shortages are another major issue for the aviation 
community. We have seen how the pilot shortage has wreaked 
havoc in the commercial air industry, with an unprecedented 
amount of flight delays and cancellations. A key factor in this 
crisis is the shortage of designated pilot examiners, DPEs. But 
the FAA has done nothing to address this.
    There has been a shortage of pilot examiners for years now. 
Plenty of students love flying, and they are ready to embark on 
a career as a commercial pilot, but are having to wait far too 
long for their certifications. To make matters worse, student 
pilots cannot work towards other certifications while they are 
waiting.
    For example, a student pilot can't get paid for their 
flying hours until they get their private pilot license, making 
it financially difficult for most to work towards getting their 
commercial license.
    Another issue that was brought to my attention just last 
night from a constituent are the delays in medical clearances. 
The FAA medical division requires pilots to respond to their 
requests within 30 to 60 days, yet it takes 8 to 10 months to 
respond to pilots.
    Every day that FAA fails to address these critical issues, 
they continue to delay commercial pilots entering the 
workforce. It is totally unacceptable.
    Before I go, I want to remind everyone that the FAA's 
stated mission is--and this is a direct quote--to ``provide the 
safest, most efficient aerospace industry in the world and 
satisfy the needs of aviation interests of the United States.'' 
The FAA has failed to uphold this mission. As a result, the 
aviation system in the country has become less efficient, more 
expensive, and increasingly burdensome for the people who work 
to improve the aviation industry.
    If the FAA wants to be a trusted regulatory body, there 
must be consistency and transparency in how rules are upheld 
and how certifications are granted.
    I am a proud member of the aviation community and, as I 
mentioned, I have been so for four decades. I hope my testimony 
today has helped my colleagues on this committee understand 
just how harmful the FAA has become to this industry.
    [Mr. Hern's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
  Prepared Statement of Hon. Kevin Hern, a Representative in Congress 
                       From the State of Oklahoma
    My name is Kevin Hern and I have been flying for 42 years, with 
thousands of hours of experience in the air. I have had extensive 
conversations with a great deal of individuals within the aviation 
industry and the issues they face with the FAA. I am here to speak 
about the aviation community's dissatisfaction with inconsistencies in 
flight standard district offices, FSDO's, and the ongoing pilot 
shortage.
    I've heard from multiple sectors in the aviation community, from 
heavy lift helicopter operators to aircraft repairmen, about the 
serious lack of consistency from FSDO's. It is a common complaint that 
each FSDO office and inspector interprets and administers the rules set 
forth by the FAA. There are 77 FSDO offices operating in the United 
States, meaning 77 different ways rules and regulations can be 
interpreted, and that doesn't even account for individual inspectors at 
each FSDO interpreting rules in their own way.
    If federal oversight is going to happen, there needs to be a one 
size fits all approach, and each rule and regulation needs to be the 
same across the board. The aviation community is frustrated that the 
FAA claims they oversee safety and regulatory standards across the 
entire US, when in reality there is a complete disconnect between the 
FAA office in Washington and individuals FSDO's. FSDO's are meant to be 
a resource to the aviation community, but instead they've just become 
unhelpful with their inconsistent guidance and burdensome certification 
processes. This is not a new issue, those in the aviation industry have

the end of the day, if the FAA is going to operate at a federal level, 
they must ensure all FSDO's interpret rules and safety standards 
equally, treating and regulating everyone the same way from FSDO to 
FSDO.
    The next thing I want to touch on is pilot shortages. We have seen 
how the pilot shortage has created havoc in the commercial air 
industry, with an unprecedented amount of flight delays and 
cancellations. The FAA has taken no steps to address a main driver of 
this issue; the shortage of designated pilot examiners. There has been 
a shortage of pilot examiners for_(waiting on CRS answer) years now. 
There are plenty of individuals who love flying and are ready to embark 
on a career as a commercial pilot, but are having to wait around for 
their certifications. To make matters worse, these pilot students can't 
work towards other certifications while waiting on one they've been 
ready for. For example, a pilot student can't start getting paid for 
their flying hours until they get their private pilot license, making 
it financially difficult for most to work towards getting their 
commercial license. It is completely unacceptable that the FAA 
continues to delay commercial pilots entering the workforce by not 
addressing the designated pilot examiner shortage.
    To close out, I want to remind everyone that the FAA states that 
their mission is to ``provide the safest, most efficient aerospace 
industry in the world and satisfy the needs of aviation interest of the 
United States.'' In the past few years, the FAA has failed to uphold 
this mission, and the aviation system in this country continues to 
become less efficient, more expensive, and increasingly burdensome for 
the people who work to uplift and improve the aviation industry. If the 
FAA wants to be a trusted regulatory body, there must be consistency 
and transparency in how rules are upheld and how certifications are 
granted. I am a proud member of the aviation community, and hope to 
help lawmakers here in Washington understand how harmful the FAA has 
been to the industry.

    Mr. Hern. I yield back.
    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, Representative Hern.
    Any questions for Representative Hern?
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Just a--not a question, really, 
but a comment is that this is really a nonpartisan set of 
issues you have outlined here. We have been trying to deal with 
these issues for some time with the FAA, and I really 
appreciate you bringing these up. And hopefully, we will have 
an opportunity in the FAA bill to push the FAA in the right 
direction on this and many other issues that we are dealing 
with with the FAA. So, thanks for bringing that up.
    Mr. Hern. May I respond for one second?
    There are so few pilots or people that are involved in the 
aviation industry. My colleague next to me has been a pilot for 
a number of years. I think it is important, and I really 
appreciate this opportunity to actually hear from people who 
are Members of Congress who actually have been flying.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes.
    Mr. Hern. Because we get a different conversation back home 
with our constituents.
    And I meant completely to imply that we do a bipartisan 
solution, because it hasn't been restricted to the aviation 
industry.
    And I know I have talked to the chairman about this. This 
is something we need to get after for safety and for the future 
of commercial air service in this country.
    I yield back. Thank you so much for allowing me----
    Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. Yes, I know, as a 
father of a son who is planning to fly in the Navy, and he is 
delaying his entry until the pipeline for training is shorter 
than 9 months, I understand exactly what the shortage of 
examiners and trainers means, and that just translates on the 
commercial side, as well.
    Mr. Hern. Thank you.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes.
    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Any other questions?
    Thank you, Representative Hern. I appreciate it. Well said.
    We will now move on to Bill Johnson from Ohio, 
Representative Johnson, 5 minutes.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. BILL JOHNSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                     FROM THE STATE OF OHIO

    Mr. Johnson of Ohio. Well, thank you, Chairman Graves and 
Ranking Member Larsen, and distinguished members of the House 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I appreciate the 
opportunity to testify on my top priority for the 2023 FAA 
reauthorization bill.
    I understand that the purpose of the FAA reauthorization is 
to reauthorize the FAA and its programs that are designed to 
provide steady funding for maintaining and improving airport 
infrastructure and aviation safety.
    That said, I bring to your attention a concern with the 
requirements for primary airport status, which is currently 
defined solely by the number of commercial passenger 
enplanements, the number of commercial passengers that come in 
and out of an airport. This definition does not consider other 
critical factors that can drastically increase the amount of 
air traffic received by an airport and the associated 
maintenance costs, particularly public airports that are used 
by the U.S. military.
    I recently sponsored legislation, H.R. 2558, that would 
amend the requirements for primary airport status to include 
public airports that are also used by a military air reserve 
station. This bill has bipartisan and bicameral support. While 
it contains just one small provision, H.R. 2558 would be 
greatly beneficial to airports that provide a critical service 
to our Nation by supporting a military or reserve station in 
addition to serving commercial cargo and general aviation air 
traffic, but may not otherwise meet the current criteria for 
commercial enplanements to receive the funding provided to 
primary airports.
    Presently, there is just one airport that falls into this 
category, and that is the Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport. 
This airport is located in Trumbull County, Ohio, and together 
with the Youngstown Air Reserve Station, it serves as one of 
the largest employers in the Mahoning Valley region. Although 
this airport presently receives only a small amount of 
commercial air traffic, the runways are used every single day 
by general aviation cargo, and especially military aircraft 
performing training and critical national security operational 
missions.
    The increased funding provided to primary airports would 
enable the airport to advance much-needed maintenance, 
including a runway resurfacing project, that would not only 
increase safety and operations for military and other 
categories of aviation, but would assist in their effort to 
attract additional commercial air operations, as well.
    Additionally, should any of the other airports supporting 
an air reserve station--and there are only a handful of these 
air reserve stations located at public airports, rather than a 
military base--fall below 10,000 annual commercial 
enplanements, this legislation would ensure that they would 
also maintain their primary airport status and associated 
funding.
    These airports are economic drivers for their local 
communities, but they also perform an important role for 
America's national security and military readiness. I strongly 
believe this essential military usage that doesn't exist at 
most commercial airports should enable the Youngstown-Warren 
Airport and any other airport supporting an air reserve station 
to receive the funding that is so very critical for maintaining 
the airport for the unique aviation traffic that they serve.
    The $1 million annual maintenance and operations funding of 
a primary airport versus the mere $150,000 annually for 
nonprimary airports will drastically increase the Youngstown-
Warren Airport's ability to maintain the safety and 
infrastructure needs of American aviators, especially our 
essential military aviators.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify. It is my 
hope to work with you to ensure that this year's FAA 
reauthorization is designed to meet the maintenance and 
infrastructure funding needs of our Nation's aviation sector, 
especially the military sector.
    And I respectfully urge you to include the text of H.R. 
2558--it is really very simple--in the 2023 FAA reauthorization 
bill.
    And with that, I yield back.

primary airport, versus the mere $150,000 annually for non-primary 
airports, will drastically increase their ability to maintain the 
safety and infrastructure needs of American aviators, especially our 
essential military aviators.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify. It is my hope to 
work with you to ensure that this year's FAA Reauthorization is

    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, Mr. Johnson.
    Are there any questions for Bill?
    Seeing none, thank you for your testimony, and we will 
include it in the record.
    Mr. Johnson of Ohio. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Graves of Missouri. We will next move to Mr. Meuser 
from Pennsylvania.
    Dan, you have 5 minutes. Thanks for being here.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. DANIEL MEUSER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
             FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA

    Mr. Meuser. Thank you very much, Chairman Graves. I really 
appreciate it. I want to certainly thank you, Chairman Graves, 
as well as subcommittee Chair Garret Graves and Ranking Member 
Larsen, and members of the committee for giving me this 
opportunity to testify.
    I am here today to inform the committee of a few reasons 
why it is important to reopen the EAS, the Essential Air 
Service program for rural airports or other types of funding 
that would assist smaller local airports to stay open or 
reopen.
    First, reopening the EAS program is valuable, of course, to 
rural airports that are lacking commercial air service. The 
program is meant to support rural communities in accessing the 
Nation's airspace with commercial air service and reopening the 
program for communities who have lost this important resource. 
The EAS brings with it tremendous economic and quality-of-life 
benefits, which you can relate to, for the residents it serves.
    The absence of commercial air services leaves rural 
communities without access to the Nation's airspace, forcing 
residents to travel hours to the closest airport for service. 
This hinders economic growth, obviously, for business, and 
creates an obstacle to revitalize efforts in such communities. 
An example in my district, where a town, a city, is being 
negatively impacted by the lack of air service is Williamsport, 
Pennsylvania. It is a city of 27,000 people, with over 200,000 
people living in surrounding counties. This region of northeast 
central Pennsylvania is also home to nine different colleges 
and universities and hundreds of businesses. We also have a lot 
of activity due to the natural gas plant, and not having the 
airport open is absolutely hindering that.
    The nearest airport to Williamsport is driving at least 2 
hours. So, Williamsport Regional Airport lost commercial air 
service in October 2021, when American Airlines pulled out of 
the market. This decision has left the surrounding communities 
without commercial air service for, well, since then. 
Williamsport originally qualified for the EAS, but was not 
enrolled in the program because in 2008, U.S. Airways decided 
to provide service to the community without program funding. 
So, the airport lost the ability to be within the EAS when the 
program closed. U.S. Airways only made this decision to fly 
without program funding when the airline found that it was 
outbid by a competitor.
    Unfortunately, Williamsport's qualification got pulled when 
Congress decided to close the program during a previous FAA 
reauthorization, which you are aware of, leaving Williamsport 
without a viable option for a commercial airline.
    Williamsport is not alone in lacking this air service. 
There are 13 other airports that recently lost air service, and 
the statistic will grow. Opening the EAS for rural communities 
will alleviate the congestion at larger airport hubs by having 
smaller airports share the load. And we see that. We see the 
safety concerns, we see the high level of congestion taking 
place. It is almost on the news perhaps once a week. So, this 
program would improve air safety for passengers flying across 
the country during a time when the FAA has noted too many close 
calls of serious runway incursions.
    I have introduced a bill, Supporting Middle America's 
Airports Act, as well as the Essential Air Service Reform Act, 
one of which just completely opens up the EAS, the other 
provides reforms to it.
    So, I would just add in my last minute that this is a very, 
very, very serious issue for the city of Williamsport. It is 
where the Little League World Series takes place. Its growth is 
very much dependent upon it. Community leadership is willing to 
provide many subsidies, as well, and funding in the millions to 
help support it. Such additional funding may likely only be 
necessary via an EAS or the other type of funding for the 
community service program for a short time, just to get it up 
and going and get a reasonable commercial flight to a 
reasonable hub.
    So, I conclude, I appreciate it, and I really appreciate 
particularly, Chairman Graves, your listening on this issue, as 
well as Chairman Garret Graves, for all of your consideration. 
And I yield back.
    [Mr. Meuser's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Daniel Meuser, a Representative in Congress 
                 From the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
    I want to begin by thanking Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, 
and Members of the Committee for giving me the opportunity to testify 
before you today as you consider various Transportation and 
Infrastructure priorities including the FAA Reauthorization. I am here 
today to inform the Committee of the four main reasons why it is 
important to reopen the Essential Air Service Program for rural 
airports.
    First, reopening the Essential Air Service Program is valuable to 
rural airports that are lacking commercial air service. The program is 
meant to support rural communities in accessing the nations' airspace 
with commercial air service and reopening the program for communities 
who have lost this important resource.
    The Essential Air Service Program brings with it tremendous 
economic and quality of life benefits to the residents it serves. The 
absence of commercial air service leaves rural communities without 
access to the nation's air space, forcing residents to travel hours to 
the closest airport for service. This hinders economic growth for 
business in the region and creates an obstacle to revitalization 
efforts in the community.
    An example in my district where a town is being negatively impacted 
by the lack of air service is Williamsport, a town of 27,603 people 
with nearly 200,000 people living in surrounding counties. This region 
of Northeast Pennsylvania is also home to six colleges and universities 
and more than 130 businesses. Yet, the nearest airport is located an 
hour and a half away in Central Pennsylvania. Williamsport Regional 
Airport lost commercial air service in October 2021 when American 
Airlines pulled out of the market. This decision has left the 
surrounding communities without commercial air service for over a year. 
Williamsport originally qualified for Essential Air Service but did not 
enroll in the program because in 2008 U.S. Airways decided to provide 
service to the community without program funding. U.S. Airways only 
made this decision to fly without program funding when the airline 
found out that it was outbid by a competitor. Unfortunately, 
Williamsport's qualification got pulled when Congress decided to close 
the program during previous FAA reauthorizations, leaving Williamsport 
without a viable option to attract a commercial airline. Williamsport 
is not alone in lacking air service in the United States. There are 
thirteen other airports that recently lost air service and this 
statistic will only grow over the next few years.
    Finally, reopening the Essential Air Service Program for rural 
communities could alleviate congestion at major airport hubs by having 
smaller airports share the load. Imagine your constituents having to 
drive four hours round trip to drop their daughter off for a trip. 
Routing more flights through a rural airport would ease congestion on 
highways and at major hubs. This program would improve air safety for 
passengers flying across the country, during a time in which the FAA 
has noted ``too many close calls'' of serious runway incursions.
    However, I introduced two bills that address this issue. H.R.2467, 
the Supporting Middle America's Airports Act which would reopen the 
Essential Air Service Program for a three-year period. H.R. 2466, the 
Essential Air Service Reform Act which would modify key provisions of 
the program to reduce overall cost and set it on a more fiscally 
responsible course. These bills would allow rural airports that qualify 
for the program to receive this essential support. Further, the 
Essential Air Service Reform Act would reform the program to serve 
these airports without the need to raise spending. The Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee has the opportunity to restore commercial 
air service in rural communities by considering my legislation in the 
FAA Reauthorization.
    Transportation and infrastructure are core functions of governments 
and ensuring access to air service is an important component of that 
work.

    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Anybody have any questions for 
Representative Meuser?
    Seeing none, thanks, Dan, for coming in, and we will make 
your testimony part of the record.
    Next up we have Mr. Landsman from Ohio.
    Thanks for being here. Greg, you have 5 minutes.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. GREG LANDSMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                     FROM THE STATE OF OHIO

    Mr. Landsman. Well, thank you, Chairman Graves and Ranking 
Member Larsen, all the members of this committee. I appreciate 
the opportunity to speak with you all today.
    We should all know by now what has happened in East 
Palestine, Ohio. The derailment, as you all know, was 
catastrophic, not only for the families in the proximity to the 
site, but to those miles and miles away, like my constituents 
down the Ohio River in Cincinnati, in southwest Ohio. Many 
Ohioans were rightfully concerned for their own health and 
safety and for the health and safety of their children.
    Norfolk Southern has assisted somewhat, but families were 
displaced, and there are lasting concerns of long-term health, 
loss in property value, and access to clean drinking water.
    So, my request today is that the committee consider this 
preventable incident in East Palestine, Ohio, during the 
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration 
reauthorization work.
    I will also put a plug in for Congressmen Bill Johnson and 
Emilia Sykes' bill, the RAIL Act, which will help to decrease 
the number of derailments throughout the country. It is a 
bipartisan bill supported by, among others, many, many of us in 
the Ohio delegation on both sides.
    In addition, I would like to talk a little bit about the 
FAA reauthorization, and ask that you consider guardrails to 
airports and how they interact with ground transportation 
teams. I happen to have a business in my district that does a 
lot of ground transportation work throughout the country, and 
want to be a strong advocate for them.
    But I also, as I have gotten further into this issue, 
appreciate that it has a lot to do with just competition and 
bringing prices down. And that is what I think some call 
curbside equity, and just allowing everyone to compete for the 
same rates and fees and rentals to ensure fair usage for 
travelers. It will bring costs down, and it just makes a lot of 
sense in terms of creating the kind of competition that we see 
in other marketplaces. But at the moment, airports have a sort 
of monopoly on these services in a way that I don't think makes 
sense. And again, this, I think, is bipartisan and will lead to 
just better services and prices for travelers.
    So, with that, I yield back. Thank you.
    [Mr. Landsman's prepared statement follows:]

providing guardrails to airports and how they interact with their 
ground transportation teams. All modes of ground transportation should 
have the same rates, fees, and rentals to ensure fair usage for 
travelers.

    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Anyone have any questions for Mr. 
Landsman?
    Seeing none, thanks, Greg, for coming in. We will make it 
part of the record.
    Mr. Thompson.

TESTIMONY OF HON. GLENN THOMPSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
             FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA

    Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania. Chairman Graves, Ranking 
Member Larsen, members of the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee, thanks for the opportunity to be able to just 
present my priorities for the 118th Congress. It is greatly 
appreciated.
    Representing one of the most rural districts east of the 
Mississippi River, a full one-third of the land mass of 
Pennsylvania, access to quality infrastructure and reliable 
transit is critical to farmers, small businesses, 
manufacturers, and others, everyday citizens throughout my 
district. In order to improve and maintain the infrastructure 
of the United States, it is crucial we support programs to 
promote new, innovative technologies that advance all aspects 
of our country's transportation needs.
    I want to touch on Essential Air Service first here. The 
Essential Air Service program was established to ensure 
taxpayers in small rural communities had continued connectivity 
to the entire national transportation system by subsidizing 
commuter and certified air carriers for their services to these 
areas. This program is critical in rural America and has 
provided links to hub airports at over 175 locations that would 
otherwise lack commercial air service.
    With two airports that participate in the EAS program in my 
district, I see firsthand the importance of maintaining this 
program for all Americans who live in rural areas. 
Additionally, given the success of the program in connecting 
rural communities to the rest of the world and the challenges 
of the COVID-19 pandemic for rural airports, I support 
reexamining eligibility requirements for EAS to expand the 
program's reach in the 2023 FAA reauthorization.
    I put a word of support in for what Congressman Meuser had 
shared. I share representing just a small portion of the city 
of Williamsport and, quite frankly, their lack of commercial 
service was a decision of an airline, a questionable question 
at that. But it also shows what can happen with the Essential 
Air Service, because that airport absolutely was robust in just 
the past number of years.
    So, while it is important to fully assess the impacts of 
changes to the program, our Nation's rural and small 
communities depend on commercial air service for 
transportation, medical supplies, commercial goods, and access 
to the larger business markets.
    I would like to touch briefly on the Bus Testing Facility 
Program. The Bus Testing Facility Program at the Pennsylvania 
State University is operated by the Thomas D. Larson 
Pennsylvania Transportation Institute. It tests new transit bus 
models for safety, structural integrity, durability, 
reliability, performance, noise, and fuel economy. The program 
tests new bus models before they are purchased by transit 
agencies, and this often helps address problems before the 
fleet is built, potentially saving considerable money and time.
    Since the beginning of this program, more than 530 new bus 
models have been tested, resulting in over 10,000 documented 
design failures. Without this program, manufacturers will not 
be able to sell new buses; transit agencies will not be able to 
acquire new buses; and consumers will be left with fewer 
options for transportation. Continuing to invest in initiatives 
like the Bus Testing Facility Program ensures a safer, more 
reliable future for mass transit throughout the country.
    WOTUS. Unfortunately, despite repeated bipartisan 
opposition and formal disapproval by the House and Senate, 
President Biden continues to push forward a final waters of the 
United States rule that extends the administration's attack on 
America's farmers, ranchers, and producers. Simply recognizing 
longstanding agricultural exemptions that have been too 
narrowly applied for decades does not make up for once again 
silencing the voices of American agriculture. American farmers 
and ranchers and landowners deserve a WOTUS definition that is 
fair to agriculture, maintains a historical reach of the Clean 
Water Act, and provides consistency and clarity, none of which 
is achieved by the administration's rule.
    And workforce development in infrastructure, finally. 
Rebuilding our Nation's infrastructure will require more than 
just bridges, roads, and waterways. It will require development 
of a skilled workforce that can design, build, and maintain 
that infrastructure. And as cochair of the bipartisan House 
Career and Technical Education Caucus, I recognize the 
importance and value that CTE programs offer to individuals, 
especially those in infrastructure sectors, and it is important 
that they have a seat at the table. And so, I just respectfully 
request you include dedicated funding to workforce development 
programs, including CTE programs, in any supplemental 
infrastructure program.
    I really appreciate the work of this committee, and 
certainly my written testimony includes additional priorities. 
And with that, much appreciation, and I yield back.
    [Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania's prepared statement 
follows:]

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Glenn Thompson, a Representative in Congress 
                 From the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
    Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and Members of the House 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure:
    Good morning and thank you for providing the opportunity to share 
my priorities for the 118th Congress. Representing one of the most 
rural districts east of the Mississippi River, access to quality 
infrastructure and reliable transit is critical to farmers, small 
businesses, manufacturers, and others throughout my district. In order 
to improve and maintain the infrastructure of the United States, it is 
crucial we support programs that promote new, innovative technologies 
that advance all aspects of our country's transportation needs.
                         Essential Air Service
    The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 made airlines the sole 
authority to determine which domestic markets would receive air service 
as well as what airfares passengers would be charged. Subsequently, the 
Essential Air Service (EAS) Program was established to ensure taxpayers 
in small, rural communities had continued connectivity to the entire 
National Transportation System by subsidizing commuter and certified 
air carriers.
    This program is critical in rural America and has provided links to 
hub airports at over 175 locations throughout the United States and its 
territories that would otherwise lack commercial air service. With 
rural airports located in my congressional district, including two (2) 
airports that participate in the EAS program, I see first-hand the 
importance of maintaining this program for all Americans who live in 
underserved, rural areas.
    Additionally, given the success of the program in connecting rural 
communities to the rest of the world and the challenges of the COVID-19 
pandemic on these rural airports in particular, I support reexamining 
eligibility requirements for EAS in the 2023 FAA Reauthorization before 
your Committee this year. Some airports, through no fault of their own, 
were unable to maintain the necessary passenger counts in order to 
sustain EAS service during the pandemic.
    While it is important to fully examine the impacts of reopening the 
program, our nation's rural and small communities depend on commercial 
air service for transportation, medical supplies, commercial goods, and 
access to larger business markets. By continuing or expanding regular 
air service to these areas, Americans will continue to access necessary 
medical services that might only be available in larger cities, as well 
as increasing the economic opportunities and visitors to these 
communities. I urge the Committee to fully reauthorize and carefully 
consider an expansion of the Essential Air Service Program as part of 
the FAA Reauthorization.
                      Bus Testing Facility Program
    As part of authorization of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, 
Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), 
the Bus Testing Facility Program at the Pennsylvania State University, 
operated by the Thomas D. Larson Pennsylvania Transportation Institute, 
tests new transit bus models for safety, structural integrity and 
durability, reliability, performance, maintainability, noise, and fuel 
economy.
    The program tests new bus models before they are purchased by 
transit agencies. This often helps address problems before the fleet is 
built, potentially saving considerable money and time, while avoiding 
inconveniencing passengers.
    Since the beginning of this program, more than 530 new bus models 
have been tested, resulting in over 10,300 documented design failures. 
In 2022 alone, the bus testing facility identified 174 deficiencies, 
including 27 structural, 21 road calls, and four severe safety related 
failures. By identifying these failures early in the production 
process, the program averted many fleet failures, saving millions of 
dollars in maintenance costs, litigation, and lost revenue.
    I request the Committee take a close look at this program that has 
a proven record of high-quality success and reporting. Without this 
program, manufacturers will not be able to sell new buses, transit 
agencies will not be able to acquire new buses, and consumers will be 
left with fewer options for transportation. Continuing to invest in 
initiatives like the Bus Testing Facility Program ensures a safer, more 
reliable future for mass transit throughout the country.
                Workforce Development in Infrastructure
    Rebuilding our nation's infrastructure will require more than just 
bridges, roads, and waterways; it will require the development of a 
skilled workforce that can design, build, and maintain that 
infrastructure. On July 19, 2022, during a House Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee hearing on the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg testified, ``we 
really need . . . to engage all of the players who have an opportunity 
to participate in the workforce of the future.''
    As Co-Chair of the bipartisan House Career and Technical Education 
(CTE) Caucus, I recognize the importance and value CTE programs offer 
to individuals, especially those in infrastructure sectors, and it is 
important that they have a seat at the table. CTE programs and 
apprenticeships are proven strategies that can provide individuals with 
the education and work-based learning needed for career success in 
these high-skill, high wage industry sectors and occupations.
    Congress recognized CTE as an effective workforce development 
strategy when it unanimously passed the Strengthening Career and 
Technical Education for the 21st Century Act reauthorizing the Carl D. 
Perkins Career and Technical Education Act in the 115th Congress. We 
must continue this momentum by including workforce investments 
alongside infrastructure spending.
    While I was pleased to see substantial acknowledgement of the 
importance of workforce development programs within the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act and support for pre-apprenticeship and 
apprenticeship programs, I remain concerned that CTE programs, and 
therefore thousands of high-skilled workers, were largely left out of 
these discussions.
    Therefore, I respectfully request that you include the following in 
any supplemental infrastructure legislation:
      A stipulation that states devote a portion of the 
infrastructure funds they receive to workforce development programs, 
including CTE programs, with the flexibility to invest in such programs 
they deem appropriate for local infrastructure needs, and that they 
coordinate such investments with the agencies that receive the states' 
funds from the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and Carl D. 
Perkins CTE Act so as not to duplicate efforts;
      Dedicated resources for updating the facilities and 
equipment used in CTE programs of study in infrastructure sectors to 
ensure they are aligned with fast-paced, ever-changing industry 
expectations and standards.

    Additionally, as part of this year's FAA Reauthorization, I 
encourage the Committee to consider expanding workforce development 
provisions for careers in the aviation industry. As we all know, a 
pilot shortage is plaguing commercial air travel operations throughout 
the country. These impacts have been particularly pronounced in rural 
communities, like the ones I represent, who have had several airlines 
discontinue service not because of low passenger counts or depressed 
interest, but because they simply do not have enough pilots to fly the 
planes.
    By continuing to invest in and expand successful programs, such as 
those authorized in Section 625 of the last FAA Reauthorization, we can 
ensure staffing needs can meet consumer demand for air travel, 
increasingly complex new aircraft in the global fleet, and the current 
aviation workforce reaching retirement age.
                                 WOTUS
    Unfortunately, despite repeated bipartisan opposition and formal 
disapproval by the House and Senate, President Biden continues to push 
forward a final Waters of the United States, or WOTUS, rule, the third 
different proposal in the last decade, that continues the 
Administration's attack on America's farmers, ranchers, and producers. 
As the Chairman and former Ranking Member of the House Agriculture 
Committee, I have spent the last two years traveling to more than 40 
states to hear directly from producers about the challenges they face. 
These include burdensome regulations, record inflation, snarled supply 
chains, and now an egregious government land grab. This will plunge our 
rural communities into ambiguity and threatens our nation's food 
security, which is national security.
    The Administration's final rule has nothing to do with clean water 
and everything to do with the Environmental Protection Agency's 
addiction to power. Simply recognizing long-standing agricultural 
exemptions that have been too narrowly applied for decades does not 
make up for, once again, silencing the voices of American agriculture. 
America's farmers, ranchers, and landowners deserve a WOTUS definition 
that is fair to agriculture, maintains the historical reach of the 
Clean Water Act, and provides consistency and clarity, none of which is 
achieved by the Administration's rule. It is beyond time policymakers 
here in Washington listen to the American farmers and ranchers who 
provide food and fiber for our nation and the world.
                             Fire Retardant
    Fire retardant is a critical tool that the Forest Service and other 
firefighting agencies utilize when fighting wildfire, and it is 
typically distributed by airtankers. Fire retardant is not used for 
extinguishing wildfire but rather to decrease the intensity of fire and 
slow its advance. Since the 1950s, it has been an essential tool to 
help suppress and control disastrous wildfires, save homes and 
communities, and protect firefighters and residents during these 
catastrophes.
    The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly known as the 
Clean Water Act (CWA), is the central law governing pollution of the 
nation's surface waters. The CWA usually requires a National Pollution 
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for a pollutant into a 
``water of the US'' from a point source. According to recent Forest 
Service testimony, the agency's position has been that this permit was 
not required for fire control activities based upon guidance received 
from EPA in 2003. The agency is prohibited from releasing retardant 
directly into water bodies, except in cases of extreme life-threatening 
situations, and the Forest Service estimates that less than 1% of 
retardant drops had any impact on waterways. While there currently is 
no NPDES permit for the aerial application of fire retardant, the 
Forest Service is working with EPA on a general permit for its 
continued use.
    Until that time, it is critical that the Forest Service continues 
its use of retardants. The Forest Service has stated that if the agency 
is only permitted to use water from airtankers, their ability to 
suppress fires would be significantly impacted. Requiring new 
permitting for fire retardant directly undermines the Forest Service's 
ability to slow the spread of wildfire and keep firefighters and 
residents safe during these catastrophes.
    Thank you to Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and Members of 
this Committee for allowing me to express my priorities for this 
Committee in the 118th Congress. I appreciate your consideration and 
look forward to working together on these and other issues.

    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, GT.
    Anybody have any questions?
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. I wasn't aware of the Bus Testing 
Facility Program at Penn State. Are there other programs in the 
country, other universities doing that work?
    Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania. I think there are, but it is 
pretty limited. So, a lot of buses that service throughout all 
the congressional districts represented here probably have 
models of buses that were tested.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes.
    Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania. Those testings are important, 
proven by the fact that over the years that they have done 
that, they found thousands of failures that the bus 
manufacturers were able to correct before the buses actually 
went on the market and were purchased by the transit agencies.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, great. Thanks. Thanks for 
bringing that up. I appreciate it.
    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Any other questions?
    Seeing none, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And we will include 
your testimony in the record.
    Ms. Barragan from California, 5 minutes.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. NANETTE DIAZ BARRAGAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
             CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Ms. Barragan. Thank you, Chairman Graves and Ranking Member 
Larsen, for the opportunity to testify this morning on my 
transportation and infrastructure priorities to the 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
    My district includes the Port of Los Angeles, the busiest 
port by container volume in the country. It is an economic 
engine not just for my district and the Greater Los Angeles 
area, but for the entire country, and it imports goods for 
American businesses and consumers throughout the entire 
country.
    In the Water Resources Development Act of 2020, billions of 
dollars in new funding were unlocked for donor ports like the 
Port of Los Angeles, which contribute far more to the Harbor 
Maintenance Trust Fund than received back. However, the recent 
2023 workplan of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers does not 
reflect these policy changes. It is important for the committee 
to provide oversight and get answers to ensure the Corps 
implements the Water Resources Development Act of 2020 in line 
with congressional intent. These port infrastructure and 
maintenance funds are important to ensure we have a strong 
supply chain without backlogs from outdated infrastructure.
    Next, as we work to maintain strong infrastructure for our 
ports, it is critical that the committee also prioritize air 
quality and public health for port communities. While Congress 
has made significant investments to address emissions from 
cargo equipment and trucks, rising shipping emissions are a 
major challenge. We will need further research and innovation 
to develop zero-emission ships that will improve air quality 
and reduce climate pollution. I encourage the committee to work 
to create a zero-emission vessel innovation fund within the 
Maritime Administration to provide $500 million in financing 
for pilot projects, demonstration projects, and research of 
zero-emissions marine vessels and retrofitting of existing 
vessels.
    Next, as the Department of Transportation implements the 
infrastructure and jobs law, this committee will play an 
important oversight role to ensure the funds reach communities 
that have faced decades of underinvestment and air pollution. 
This is part of the Biden administration's Justice40 
initiative.
    Some specific examples of programs that need to reach 
disadvantaged communities often left behind like those in my 
district are the Capital Investment Grants to expand public 
transit, including the planned West Santa Ana light rail line, 
which would connect communities in southeastern L.A. County 
with downtown Los Angeles; or the Low-No Bus Program to support 
zero-emission buses--both Long Beach and Los Angeles have goals 
for 100 percent zero-emission transit buses by 2030; or the 
electric vehicle charging infrastructure which needs to include 
funding for multifamily homes and shared vehicles for non-car 
owners at public housing.
    Finally, as the committee works on the FAA reauthorization 
bill, I want to highlight a few priorities of our hard-working 
flight attendants and transport workers that I share. These 
include the Cabin Air Safety Act to protect pilots, flight 
attendants, and passengers from toxic cabin air; or the 
Protection from Abusive Passengers Act to hold passengers 
accountable if they assault a crewmember or passenger; and the 
Global Aircraft Maintenance Safety Improvement Act to ensure 
one standard of safety and security applies to our aircraft 
maintenance, regardless of where it is repaired.
    I want to thank the committee for the time and for your 
consideration of these priorities. I look forward to working 
with the committee this Congress to advance them forward. I 
yield back.

    Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify on my transportation and 
infrastructure priorities to the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee.
    Ports and Implementation of the Water Resources Development Act
    My district includes the Port of Los Angeles, the busiest port by 
container volume in the country. It's an economic engine for my 
district and the greater Los Angeles area, and imports goods for 
American businesses and consumers throughout the country.
    In the Water Resources Development Act of 2020, billions of dollars 
in new funding were unlocked for donor ports like the Port of Los 
Angeles, which contribute far more to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund 
than they receive back. However, the recent 2023 work plan of the U.S.

ensure the Corps implements the Water Resources Development Act of 2020 
in line with Congressional intent.
    These port infrastructure and maintenance funds are important to 
ensure we have a strong supply chain without backlogs from outdated 
infrastructure.
                      Zero-Emissions Shipping Fund
    As we work to maintain strong infrastructure for our ports, it's 
critical that the committee also prioritize air quality and public 
health for port communities. While Congress has made significant 
investments to address emissions from cargo equipment and trucks, 
rising shipping emissions are a major challenge.
    We need further research and innovation to develop zero-emission 
ships that will improve air quality and reduce climate pollution. I 
encourage the committee to work to create a Zero-Emission Vessel 
Innovation Fund within the Maritime Administration to provide $500 
million in financing for pilot projects, demonstration projects, and 
research of zero-emission marine vessels and retrofitting of existing 
vessels.
   Implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Justice40
    As the Department of Transportation implements the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law, this committee will play an important oversight 
role to ensure the funds reach communities that have faced decades of 
underinvestment and air pollution. This is part of the Biden 
administration's Justice40 Initiative.
    Some specific examples of programs that need to reach communities 
of color and disadvantaged communities like those in my district are:
      Capital Investment Grants to expand public transit, 
including the planned West Santa Ana light rail line, which would 
connect communities in Southeastern LA County with Downtown Los 
Angeles:
      The Low-No Bus Program to support zero-emission buses. 
Both Long Beach and Los Angeles have goals for 100% zero-emission 
transit buses by 2030.
      Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure, which needs to 
include funding for multi-family homes and shared vehicles for non-car 
owners at public housing.
                          FAA Reauthorization
    Finally, as the committee works on the FAA Reauthorization bill, I 
want to highlight a few priorities of our hardworking flight attendants 
and transport workers that I share. These include:
      The Cabin Air Safety Act by Representative Garamendi to 
protect pilots, flight attendants, and passengers from toxic cabin air;
      The Protection from Abusive Passengers Act by 
Representative Eric Swalwell to hold passengers accountable if they 
assault a crewmember or passenger; and
      The Global Aircraft Maintenance Safety Improvement Act by 
Representatives Molinaro and Brownley to ensure one standard of safety 
and security applies to our aircraft maintenance, regardless of where 
it is repaired.

    Thank you for your consideration of these priorities. I look 
forward to working with the Committee this Congress to advance them 
forward.

    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, Nanette.
    Anyone have any questions, the committee?
    Seeing none, thank you very much, Representative Barragan. 
We will make sure that your testimony gets included in the 
record.
    We will next move on to Ms. Escobar from Texas.
    Ms. Escobar. Thank you so much.
    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Veronica.

    TESTIMONY OF HON. VERONICA ESCOBAR, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
                CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS

    Ms. Escobar. Thank you, Chairman Graves and Ranking Member 
Larsen, for holding today's hearing.
    I have the honor of representing El Paso, Texas, a 
community on the U.S.-Mexico border, and one of the busiest 
trade corridors in the country. The El Paso ports of entry 
serve as critical gateways to global trade, moving nearly $82 
billion in trade and commerce annually through our land ports.
    This committee plays a meaningful role in ensuring our 
community has infrastructure to support the region's 
transportation network, which contributes to our local, State, 
and national economy. I would like to take this opportunity to 
expand on several of our regional priorities for your 
consideration.
    And thank you so much, Ranking Member Larsen, for visiting 
the community several weeks ago.
    Chairman Graves, I would love for you to visit, as well, so 
that you can see some of those great investments at work.
    This year, I am excited to have submitted several 
transportation and infrastructure community project funding 
requests that would make critical investments in our region, 
one of which is a $4 million funding request for the El Paso 
Regional Ports of Entry System Development Study and 
Operational Plan, which would conduct a study of the key needs 
of all land ports, from Tornillo in east El Paso County to 
Santa Teresa to our west in New Mexico.
    The goal of the study will be to initiate a plan 
comprehensive to all ports and infrastructure corridors as a 
unique regional system. Our land ports of entry network needs 
key improvements and analysis so that we develop a targeted 
understanding of how they should be developed into a cohesive 
transportation system.
    Next I would like to shift to a few priorities that will 
play critical roles for the future of transportation in El 
Paso, the first being an exemption through the FAA to the 
perimeter rule to allow for nonstop flights between El Paso and 
Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Our region's 
significant military presence, from serving the two largest 
Department of Defense installations in the Nation, Fort Bliss 
and White Sands Missile Range, passenger demand, and airline 
competitiveness would all benefit from such a change.
    A study by the Brookings Institution also found that adding 
a single nonstop flight from Reagan National to a new city 
generates $100 million in economic activity and 1,000 new jobs. 
That is why I urge this committee to consider including in this 
year's FAA this request to allow for ``beyond perimeter'' 
exemptions.
    The second request is to increase funding for the FAA's 
Airport Improvement Program, which provides more than $3 
billion in entitlement and discretionary grant funds for a 
network of more than 3,300 eligible airports, including the El 
Paso International Airport.
    The third request is to expand Federal funding 
opportunities to support projects like the El Paso northeast 
rail spur and overpass initiative, which involves connecting 
the Union Pacific rail line in northeast El Paso to more than 
5,000 acres of city-owned, contiguous developable land. The 
land is ideal for large-scale economic development projects 
with significant private capital investment, which would 
stimulate tens of thousands of high-quality jobs.
    The fourth request is support increasing funding for RAISE 
Grants and other Federal funding opportunities that support the 
revitalization of communities and the development of green 
spaces through projects such as the Deck Plaza project in El 
Paso, a 7-acre project that we hope will be located above I-10.
    Lastly, a new land port infrastructure development grant 
program is needed to bolster border infrastructure projects to 
create operational efficiency and other improvements. 
International bridges in communities like mine must be 
modernized to keep pace with the exponential increases in trade 
with Mexico, especially as we reshore and nearshore 
manufacturing. It will strengthen supply chains, improve 
operational capabilities and infrastructure capacity, and spur 
economic growth.
    I urge you to support these requests. I thank you for your 
time, and I appreciate your leadership. Thank you so much.
    [Ms. Escobar's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
   Prepared Statement of Hon. Veronica Escobar, a Representative in 
                    Congress From the State of Texas
    Thank you, Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen for hosting 
this Member Day hearing.
    I have the honor of representing El Paso, Texas in Congress, a 
community that is right on the U.S.-Mexico border that is one of the 
busiest trade corridors in the country. The El Paso Ports of Entry 
serve as critical gateways to global trade, moving hundreds of billions 
of dollars in trade and commerce annually through our land ports. This 
committee plays a meaningful role in ensuring our community has the 
resources and infrastructure to support the region's transportation 
network which contributes to our local, state, and nation economy. I 
would like to take this opportunity to expand upon several of our 
regional priorities for your consideration.
    This year, I am excited to have submitted three transportation and 
infrastructure Community Project Funding requests that would make 
critical investments in our region.
    The first project, and my top priority for CPFs, is a $4 million 
funding request for the El Paso Regional Ports of Entry System 
Development Study and Operational Plan to conduct a study of the key 
needs of all land ports from Tornillo in El Paso County, Texas to Santa 
Teresa in New Mexico. The goal of the study will be to initiate a plan 
comprehensive to all ports and infrastructure corridors as a unique 
regional system. This request is very important because our Land Ports 
of Entry network needs key improvements and analysis to develop a 
targeted understanding of how they should be developed as a cohesive 
transportation system.
    The second project is a $3 million request to develop the design 
and reconstruction of the Terminal Bridge, which serves as the primary 
exit from the El Paso International Airport. The Bridge is beyond its 
useful life, is presently in poor conditions, and its existing design 
generates conflicts points for vehicular traffic entering and exiting 
the airport.
    The third project is a $750,000 funding request for the Sun Metro 
Micro Transit to purchase a small fleet of electric micro-transit 
vehicles, charging infrastructure, and appurtenances. This investment 
will increase the safety and efficiency of the Sun Metro bus fleet, 
reduce greenhouse emissions, and increase access to transit services 
with limited transit service.
    Next, I want to shift to a few priorities that will play critical 
roles for the future of transportation in El Paso. The first being an 
exemption, through the FAA, to the ``perimeter rule'' to allow for non-
stop flights between El Paso (ELP) and Ronald Reagan Washington 
National Airport (DCA). Our region's significant military presence from 
serving the two largest DoD installations in the nation, Fort Bliss, 
and White Sands Missile Range; passenger demand; and airline 
competitiveness would all benefit from such a change. Additionally, 
modern airline technologies make non-stop flights both safe and 
environmentally sound. A study by the Brookings Institution also found 
that adding a single nonstop flight from Reagan National to a new city 
generates $100 million in economic activity and 1,000 new jobs. That is 
why I urge this committee to consider including in this year's FAA this 
request to allow for ``beyond-perimeter'' exemptions.
    The second request is to increase funding for the FAA's Airport 
Import Improvement Program (AIP) which provides more than $3 billion in 
entitlement and discretionary grant funds for a network of more than 
3,300 eligible airports, including the El Paso International Airport.
    The third request is to expand federal funding opportunities to 
support projects like the El Paso Northeast rail spur and overpass 
initiative, which involves connecting the Union Pacific rail line in 
Northeast El Paso to more than 5,000 acres of City-owned contiguous 
developable land. The land is ideal for large-scale economic 
development projects with significant private capital investment, 
stimulating tens of thousands of quality jobs in advanced clean energy 
and semiconductor manufacturing, aerospace and defense manufacturing 
and R&D, and critical reshoring operations.
    The fourth request is to support increasing funding for RAISE 
Grants and other federal funding opportunities that support the 
revitalization of communities and development of green spaces through 
projects such as the Deck Plaza project, a 7-acre project site located 
in I-10 Downtown El Paso and has a high concentration of traffic 
collisions and unaddressed structural safety risks. The expansion of I-
10 is needed to secure national supply chain resiliency, meet 
transportation demand from trade with Mexico, and reduce emissions from 
local and transient traffic within in a Historically Underserved 
Community.
    Lastly, a new Land Port Infrastructure Development Grant Program is 
needed to bolster border infrastructure projects and operational 
efficiency improvements. As we try to compete in the 21s century, we 
must ensure we are moving away from 21st-century transportation 
infrastructure. International bridges, and particularly land ports in 
communities like mine, must be modernized to keep with the pace of 
exponential increase in trade from trade agreements with Mexico and 
Canada. Investment in port modernization will strengthen supply chains, 
improve operational capabilities and infrastructure capacity, spur 
economic growth, and bolster national security.
    These priorities will ensure our borderland's economic growth and 
the strength of our national supply chains, which relies on the nearly 
$81.9 billion annually in trade flowing through the El Paso Ports of 
Entry alone. I urge you to support these requests and thank you for 
ensuring investments in our country's infrastructure and transportation 
needs.

    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, Representative Escobar.
    Any questions for Veronica?
    Seeing none, we will include your testimony in the record, 
and thank you very much for coming.
    Next we have--is it Sablan? Did I pronounce that right? I 
am horrible at enunciation.
    Mr. Sablan. Yes, perfect. Exactly as I would say it.
    Mr. Graves of Missouri. From the Northern Marianas. Thanks 
for being here, and I look forward to hearing what you have to 
say.

TESTIMONY OF HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO SABLAN, A DELEGATE IN 
  CONGRESS FROM THE TERRITORY OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS

    Mr. Sablan. Well, thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. 
Chairman, and Ranking Member Larsen, and members of the 
committee for the invitation to submit testimony as you develop 
the bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration's 
funding and program authority beyond fiscal year 2023.
    I am asking that the committee consider including my 
district, the Northern Mariana Islands, among the locations 
eligible to participate in the Department of Transportation's 
Essential Air Service, or EAS, program.
    Adding the Northern Mariana Islands to Alaska and Hawaii 
among the locations exempt from EAS requirements would help 
ensure scheduled air service is always available to residents 
and visitors of the Marianas. The Northern Marianas are 14 
islands, separate islands, ranging from just south of 
Chichijima all the way down to Guam. But we only service three 
of the islands, and one of the islands actually has an Air 
Force project, the Divert Airfield, which ironically is going 
to get more expensive to get down there for visitors and also 
for contractors.
    Air service, of course, is vital and the only practical 
means of transportation between the islands of the Marianas. 
Commuter air service can, however, be unreliable, and fare 
prices have increased significantly in recent years.
    One carrier has been providing air service between the 
three Mariana Islands of Rota, Tinian, and Saipan, and to Guam 
for over a decade. However, in December 2021, the carrier 
abruptly suspended all air service for over a week and did not 
resume scheduled service for 3 weeks due to disputes over fees 
with the local port authority.
    These actions prompted the former Marianas Governor to use 
ARPA funds to have a second air carrier set up shop in the 
Marianas to provide partially subsidized community air service 
between the islands. However, when the new commonwealth 
government administration took office in January, the use of 
Rescue Act funds was questioned and subsequently halted, 
causing the second carrier to shut down operations and close 
business. These events caused a rapid increase in interisland 
fare rates that have remained historically high.
    I could stand at an airport on Saipan and see the island of 
Tinian 3 miles down, and it cost me $80 to fly round trip.
    Although communities in the Northern Marianas were 
originally eligible for EAS, none of our airports were 
receiving EAS subsidies between September 30, 2010, and 
September 30, 2011, and therefore became ineligible when the 
FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 was enacted, changing 
the definition of ``eligible place'' for receiving EAS.
    To ensure that communities in the Marianas will always have 
at least a minimal level of scheduled air service, EAS 
eligibility must be reconsidered and the law amended. These 
changes will not automatically--again, it will not 
automatically--place Marianas airports in the program, but it 
will ensure that EAS assistance is available if ever needed.
    I respectfully ask that the Northern Marianas be included 
in the exemptions to EAS requirements, along with Alaska and 
Hawaii. Legislative text effectuating this change is attached 
for your reference, Mr. Chairman.
    I thank the committee for its consideration of this 
proposal for inclusion in the Federal Aviation Administration 
Authorization Act of fiscal year 2024, and I welcome the 
chairman and Mr. Carbajal right now, but also Mr. Larsen to 
come visit the Marianas. If we go on a commercial airline, it 
will take us no more than 36 hours to get there from 
Washington, DC. It takes me 26 hours to get here. And then, 
when I come to my district, I still need to fly that 5-minute 
hopper that costs $80 round trip to visit another island. And 
another island is 20 minutes further down. So, yes. Welcome.
    [Mr. Sablan's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan, a Delegate 
     in Congress From the Territory of the Northern Mariana Islands
    Thank you, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and Members of 
the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, for the invitation 
to submit testimony as you develop a bill to reauthorize the Federal 
Aviation Administration's funding and program authorities beyond Fiscal 
Year 2023.
    I request that you consider including my district, the Northern 
Mariana Islands, among the locations eligible to participate in the 
Department of Transportation's Essential Air Service (EAS) program. 
Adding the Northern Mariana Islands to Alaska and Hawaii among the 
locations exempt from EAS requirements would help ensure scheduled air

    These actions prompted the former Marianas governor to use American 
Rescue Plan Act funds to have a second air carrier set up shop in the 
Marianas to provide partially subsidized commuter air service between 
the islands. However, when the new administration took office in 
January, the use of Rescue Act funds was questioned and subsequently 
halted, causing the second carrier to shut down operations and close 
business. These events caused a rapid increase in inter-island airfare 
rates that have remained historically high.

eligible for EAS, none of our airports were receiving EAS subsidies 
between September 30, 2010, and September 30, 2011, and therefore

amended. This change will not automatically place Marianas airports in 
the program, but it will ensure that EAS assistance is available if 
ever needed.
    I respectfully request that the Northern Marinas Islands be 
included in the exemption to EAS requirements, along with Alaska and

    I thank the Committee for its consideration of this proposal for 
inclusion in the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2024.

    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Sablan.
    Any questions from the committee?
    Seeing none, we will make sure that your testimony gets in 
the record. We would love to come out. With that, we appreciate 
you coming in.
    Mr. Sablan. No, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Have 
a good day.
    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Next we have Mr. Casar from Texas.
    Mr. Casar. Thank you.
    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Five minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. GREG CASAR, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM 
                       THE STATE OF TEXAS

    Mr. Casar. Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, thank you for 
hearing our policy priorities, especially as it relates to the 
reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration.
    As a Congress, we should focus on the workers who keep our 
aviation system running, from pilots to flight attendants to 
air traffic controllers, maintenance crews, luggage workers, 
the folks at the ticket counters, and everyone in between. In 
my testimony, I want to focus on these workers, and especially 
those who are most often left behind: airport service workers.
    All these employees are our constituents. And in my largely 
working-class district, my constituents keep multiple airports 
running: the San Antonio Airport, the Austin Airport, the San 
Marcos Airport. And they move millions of people throughout 
Texas and in and out of Texas each year. Every person working 
in these airports deserves a living wage with benefits, a safe 
workplace, and paid time off to spend with their families.
    Let's face it. These last few years we have seen how our 
air travel systems are so fragile, and the only thing that held 
it all together were the workers, especially those who are 
lowest paid and work the longest hours. Without wheelchair 
attendants, elderly passengers wouldn't be able to navigate our 
airports with dignity. Without cabin cleaners and janitors, we 
wouldn't have clean facilities that we all expect. And when 
these workers encounter challenges like the pandemic, giant 
storms, surges of passenger traffic, they have stepped up.
    But despite the hard work of everyday people, too often we 
have seen companies not step up. We have seen corners get cut 
and prices get jacked up. It doesn't have to be this way. And 
we have an opportunity this year to do something about it.
    States, localities, and airport authorities across the 
country have adopted wage and benefit standards, but there are 
many major airports with no minimum standards other than the 
Federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. That is why I am proud 
that places like the Austin Airport in my district have set a 
$20-an-hour minimum wage for workers, whether you work in 
concessions, custodial, or customer service. If we want a top-
notch air travel system for this country, we need national wage 
and benefit standards for our airports.
    I want to share the story of a fellow Texan. Dorian Johnson 
is a passenger service agent at the Dallas-Fort Worth 
International Airport. We have lots of representation here from 
Texas, including from Houston and Dallas at the table here. And 
he came and visited my office alongside folks from my district 
talking about the full-time work he does helping passengers 
with disabilities navigate the airport. It is tough work, but 
if your family member is getting helped around by Dorian, you 
really appreciate that tough work. But Dorian has no affordable 
healthcare, no paid vacation, and no paid sick time.
    So, what I am saying is that a critically important set of 
airport workers at one of the largest airports in the world 
can't see a doctor when they are sick, can't take a day off to 
get well.
    The proposed H.R. 1499, the Good Jobs for Good Airports 
Act, authored by my mentor and friend and T&I Committee member, 
Congressman Chuy Garcia, will set national wage and benefit 
levels at major airports that receive Federal funding and 
ensures that every airport job is a good job. For my State, 
this will be huge. It will improve the lives immediately for 
37,000 Texans. People like Dorian will have a decent wage, 
affordable healthcare, and some paid time off.
    Alongside those standards and the Good Jobs for Good 
Airports Act, we can do even more to make the FAA reauth one 
that respects the working men and women in this industry. We 
can guarantee adequate training standards for our pilots. We 
can strengthen safety for our frontline aviation workers who 
have endured assaults. We can ensure adequate staffing for air 
traffic controllers to make air travel at rapidly growing 
airports like mine be more smooth and safe. We can create good-
paying American jobs by not offshoring airplane maintenance, 
and we can make sure that, with this bill, the working people 
of America are truly better off. And that would really be 
commendable and a testament to our work.
    Thank you for your leadership and consideration.
    [Mr. Casar's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
  Prepared Statement of Hon. Greg Casar, a Representative in Congress 
                        From the State of Texas
    Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen:
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide input on policy priorities 
for the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration. In the 
FAA we should focus on all the workers who keep our aviation system 
running: from pilots to flight attendants to air traffic controllers to 
custodians and luggage workers. In my testimony, I want especially to 
focus on those workers who are most often left behind: airport service 
workers.
    These workers are our constituents, and in my largely working-class 
district, my constituents work for the San Antonio Airport, the Austin 
Airport, the San Marcos airport, and many others and are key to moving 
millions of people in and out of Texas every year.
    They keep airports safe, clean and running smoothly even through a 
global pandemic, climate disasters, and busy travel seasons. All 
airport workers, whether you're flying a plane, work in aviation 
safety, or are making sure passengers with disabilities can navigate 
the airport, deserve a living wage, healthcare, and paid time off to 
spend with their families.
    Let's face it: we've seen how our air travel systems are fragile, 
and the only thing that has held it all together are our workers.
    Without our wheelchair attendants, elderly passengers and people 
with disabilities wouldn't be able to navigate the airport with 
dignity.
    Without our cabin cleaners and janitors, we wouldn't have the clean 
and sanitary facilities that we all expect.
    Instead of fixing problems, too often companies are cutting corners 
and jacking up prices--while leaving passengers and workers to deal 
with the mess.
    It doesn't have to be this way. And it's up to us to do something 
about it--for workers, for passengers, and for the taxpayers who fund 
this system.
    States, localities, and airport authorities across the country have 
already adopted wage and benefits standards, but there are a number of 
major airports with no minimum standards other than the minimum wage of 
$7.25 an hour. That's shameful. That's why I'm proud that at the Austin 
airport in my district we have set $20/hour as a bare minimum for 
workers, whether you work in concessions, custodial or customer 
service. If we want a top-notch national air travel system, we need 
national wage and benefit standards for these taxpayer-funded airports.
    I want to share the story of a fellow Texan: Dorian Johnson is a 
Passenger Service Agent at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. He 
works 40 hours a week helping passengers with disabilities navigate the 
airport and get to their destination. Despite how essential his job is, 
Dorian has no affordable healthcare, no paid vacation, and no paid sick 
time.
    Let that sink in. Airport workers at one of the largest airports in 
the world can't see a doctor when they're sick or take a day off to get 
well. We must do better than this.
    The proposed H.R. 1499, the Good Jobs for Good Airports Act, 
sponsored by my dear colleague and T&I Committee Member, Rep. Chuy 
Garcia, will set national wage and benefits levels at major airports 
that receive federal funding. It will ensure that every airport job is 
a good job with a livable wage and benefits.
    For my state, this will be huge. It will improve jobs for at least 
37,000 Texans. People like Dorian Johnson will have a decent wage, 
affordable healthcare, and paid days off.
    Alongside including the standards in Good Jobs Good Airports, we 
can ensure there's adequate training for our pilots, safety for our 
flight attendants and air traffic controllers, and good paying jobs 
with a right to organize for all workers at our airports. The FAA 
Reauthorization bill is a chance for us to create safer and more 
reliable transportation for our constituents by recognizing the 
contributions of aviation workers, especially those who often work the 
hardest job for the lowest pay.
    Thank you for your leadership and consideration.

    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, Greg.
    Does anybody have any questions for Representative Casar?
    Seeing none, we will make sure that your testimony gets in 
the record. Thanks for coming in.
    And we will continue with Texas, a whole lot of Texas. 
Representative Garcia, thanks for being here. You have 5 
minutes.

    TESTIMONY OF HON. SYLVIA R. GARCIA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
                CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS

    Ms. Garcia of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and you are 
absolutely right. Texas is definitely in the House today. Thank 
you so much for the time to speak with you today. I am eager to 
share my transportation and infrastructure-related priorities 
to this committee.
    It is our responsibility to ensure that our constituents 
have functional, safe, and reliable transportation options and 
infrastructure systems. Our Nation's transportation and 
infrastructure system must serve as a convenience to all 
Americans, not a hindrance.
    In my district, blocked railroad crossings are a major 
issue. My district leads the Nation in the number of reported 
blocked railroad crossings. In 2022, there were 3,429 reports 
of blocked intersections in Houston alone, and the East End, a 
neighborhood in my district, had the most reports of any other 
neighborhood.
    Thanks to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, there 
is now a public database for reporting these incidents of 
blocked rail crossings. However, much more needs to be done. I 
have picked up on the work of Representative Jim Cooper from 
last Congress, and introduced the Don't Block Our Communities, 
or the D-BLOC Act. This bill would prohibit rail carriers from 
blocking intersections with passing trains for more than 10 
minutes, and allow the Transportation Secretary to issue 
penalties for violations.
    Blocked crossings are not only a major inconvenience, but 
also a real danger to our communities by slowing down emergency 
vehicles, police, fire, and ambulances. My neighbors have even 
seen children making the dangerous decision to crawl underneath 
a stopped train to get to school on time. This is outrageous 
and unacceptable. We must make a change, and give the Federal 
Railroad Administration legislative options to enforce 
penalties. I hope that this committee will take up this bill 
and seriously consider the safety concerns of blocked crossings 
in my community and communities across America.
    Additionally, I would like to touch on an essential 
priority for the upcoming Federal Aviation Administration 
authorization. Through this package, I want to emphasize my 
support for airport workers. As always, I stand with our 
Nation's unions, and I want to ensure that airport employee 
members and their families have the support and dignity that 
they deserve, and are given the freedom to organize and to get 
a livable wage. In the face of a challenging commercial air 
travel market, we must make sure that airport workers make 
livable wages and are supported in the workplace.
    I commend my colleagues and my other half of the Garcia 
caucus, Representative Chuy Garcia, for his Good Jobs for Good 
Airports Act, which does exactly that. I am a proud cosponsor 
of his bill, and I hope to see it in the final FAA 
authorization.
    Finally, as the Whip for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, 
I wanted to ensure that this authorization advocates for a 
safe, efficient, and accessible national airport system to 
satisfy the needs of the Latino interests and consumers in the 
United States.
    It is also important that we certify that Latinos have 
equal opportunity in recruitment, hiring, training, and 
advancement in the Federal employment system.
    I am grateful for the opportunity to share my priorities 
today, and I encourage all members of this committee to take 
them into serious consideration.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.
    [Ms. Garcia of Texas' prepared statement follows:]

                                 
   Prepared Statement of Hon. Sylvia R. Garcia, a Representative in 
                    Congress From the State of Texas
    Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you for allowing me to speak here 
today. I am eager to share my Transportation and Infrastructure-related 
priorities for this Congress. It is our responsibility to ensure that 
our constituents have functional, safe, and reliable transportation 
options and infrastructure systems. This nation's transportation and 
infrastructure system must serve as a convenience to all Americans, not 
a hindrance.
    In my district, blocked railroad crossings are a major issue. Texas 
leads the nation in number of blocked railroad crossings, and Houston 
leads the state. In 2022, there were 3,429 reports of blocked 
intersections in Houston alone, and the East End, a neighborhood in my 
districts, had the most reports of any other neighborhood. Thanks to 
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, there is now a public 
database for reporting these incidents of blocked rail crossings. 
However, far more needs to be done.
    I have picked up on the work of Rep. Jim Cooper from last Congress 
and introduced the Don't Block Our Communities, or D-BLOC Act. This 
bill would prohibit rail carriers from blocking intersections with 
passing trains for more than 10 minutes and allow the Transportation 
Secretary to issue civil penalties for violations. Blocked crossings 
are not only a major inconvenience, but also present real dangers to 
our community by slowing down emergency vehicles. My neighbors have 
even seen people making the dangerous decision to crawl underneath a 
stopped train to get where they need to go. We must make a change and 
give the FRA legislative options to enforce penalties. I hope to see 
this Committee take up this bill the Congress and seriously consider 
the safety concerns of blocked crossings in my community.
    Additionally, I would like to touch on an essential priority for 
the upcoming Federal Aviation Administration Authorization. Through 
this package, I want to emphasize my support for airport workers. As 
always, I stand with our nation's unions, and I want to ensure that 
airport employee members of the Service Employees International Union 
have support. In the face of a challenging commercial air travel 
market, we must make sure that airport employees make livable wages and 
are supported in the workplace. I commend Rep. Chuy Garcia for his Good 
Jobs for Good Airports Act, which does exactly that. I am proud to 
cosponsor that bill, and I hope to see it in the final FAA 
Authorization.
    Finally, as the WHIP for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I want 
to ensure that this authorization advocates for safe, efficient, and 
accessible national airport systems to satisfy the needs of Latino 
interests and consumers in the United States. It is also important that 
we certify that Latinos have equal opportunity in recruitment, hiring, 
training, and advancement in Federal employment.
    I am grateful for the opportunity to share my priorities today, and 
I encourage all Members of the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure to take them into serious consideration. Thank you, and 
I yield back.

    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, Sylvia.
    Does anyone have any questions for Representative Garcia?
    Seeing none, I will make sure your testimony gets in the 
record. Thank you for coming in.
    Ms. Garcia of Texas. Thank you so much.
    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Next up from Texas we have 
Representative Crockett.
    Jasmine, you have 5 minutes.

    TESTIMONY OF HON. JASMINE CROCKETT, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
                CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS

    Ms. Crockett. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman and Ranking 
Member, and the entire committee for your time today and 
offering this opportunity to discuss issues that are critical 
to my district and this country as we prepare for the FAA 
reauthorization.
    So, just to orient you, I proudly represent Southwest 
Airlines. I also have Dallas Love Field. I also have Dallas 
Executive Airport. And Airbus is also located in my district, 
which, for those of you that don't know, Airbus is probably the 
largest manufacturer of helicopters in the country. So, with 
that, I have been kind of busy. They have made sure that I know 
what is going on.
    So, since the 2018 reauthorization, millions of American 
families experienced the confusion and frustration of having 
flights delayed or canceled due to staffing shortages. These 
missed flights represent lost opportunities to see family, to 
celebrate, to grieve, to work, and so much more. We owe it to 
our constituents not just to hear their frustrations, but act 
upon them. That is why we need to bring more people into the 
aviation workspace.
    But we have tried for decades to solve this problem to no 
avail. We cannot rely on the same old recruitment strategies. 
We need to pull out all the stops and ensure we are recruiting 
from as wide a net as possible. That is why every stakeholder I 
have talked to, from the airlines to the airports, the 
manufacturers to the workers, support having a diverse 
workforce.
    If we talk about pilots specifically, 85 percent of pilots 
are Caucasian. That is why I urge this committee to authorize 
new funding to support HBCU and HSIs that offer scholarships 
for students majoring in the aviation field. I serve on the 
House Ag Committee, and we have a similar program there with 
our 1890 land-grant institutions, and there have been 
tremendous results.
    The 1890 universities highlight an important point about 
this proposal: it is not enough to invest ad hoc in diversity. 
If we really want to expand the workforce, we need to be 
investing in the institutions. We know from the land-grant 
universities that this public seed money will unlock millions 
more in private funding. This bill will not only bolster our 
workforce, but expand our opportunities.
    And with that, what I want to say is this: With aviation, 
the opportunities to, say, become a pilot, are cost 
prohibitive. That is just the reality. And so, when you start 
talking about increasing diversity, one of the issues that we 
have is just the cost that is associated with getting the 
education and the training. And so, this would absolutely 
afford so many more students from diverse backgrounds an 
opportunity. There are first-rate aviation degrees at HBCUs and 
HSIs, but the scholarships aren't there. This is why all 
stakeholders I spoke to in my district and across north Texas 
strongly support investing in scholarships to be administered 
by HBCUs and HSIs.
    But just as important as who flies the planes is where the 
planes fly: our airports. Every year, tens of millions of 
families fly through mid-sized hubs, airports like Dallas Love 
Field in my district. Many of these airports can only function 
because of smaller, nearby reliever airports that offload some 
of that traffic.
    As we have all recently experienced, our aviation system 
runs on a just-in-time model, with no room for delay. Backups 
at these reliever airports can cascade throughout the system 
and cause terrible consequences for our constituents as flights 
are delayed or canceled. Often the cause of delays at reliever 
airports is that they don't have the infrastructure necessary 
to keep things running smoothly.
    For those without a reliever airport in their district, 
know that most of their funding comes through the Airport 
Improvement Program that we fund. The discretionary grants in 
that program are critical for these airports to fund the 
improvements necessary to provide smooth service to the rest of 
the industry.
    Unfortunately, these tiny airports can't compete against 
their larger neighbors for the same resources. The 2018 FAA 
reauthorization recognized that, which is why there is 
currently a set-aside for reliever airports in urban areas 
experiencing congestion. But talking to the reliever airports, 
we wouldn't know the program exists because the set-aside for 
these critical institutions is two-thirds of 1 percent of 
discretionary funds.
    That is why I am calling on this committee to triple the 
funding for these reliever airports in urban congested areas to 
2 percent.
    I am running out of time, so, all I am going to say is 
this: We need to make sure that we are as safe as possible. And 
part of that safety means that we are going to invest in 
NextGen technology so that we can upgrade the technology, as we 
saw the technology failures with Southwest.
    We also need to make sure that our reliever airports are 
not having to compete with the DFW to try to get the funding 
that they need, because we need to reduce the congestion that 
we are experiencing in our urban airports.
    And with that, since I have no time to yield back, I will 
yield.
    [Ms. Crockett's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
   Prepared Statement of Hon. Jasmine Crockett, a Representative in 
                    Congress From the State of Texas
    I want to thank the Chairman, Ranking Member, and entire Committee 
for their time today, and for offering this opportunity to discuss 
issues that are critical to my District, and this country as we prepare 
for FAA Reauthorization. Since the 2018 Reauthorization, millions of 
American families experienced the confusion and frustration of having 
flights delayed or canceled due to staffing shortages.
    These missed flights represent lost opportunities--to see family, 
to celebrate, to grieve, to work, and so much more. We owe it to our 
constituents not just to hear their frustrations, but to act on them. 
That is why we need to bring more people into the aviation workforce.
    But we have tried for decades to solve this problem, to no avail.

out all the stops and ensure we are recruiting from as wide a net as 
possible. That is why every stakeholder I've talked to, from the 
airlines, to the airports, the manufacturers to the workers, support 
having a diverse workforce.
    Right now, 85% of pilots are white. That is why I urge the 
committee to authorize new funding to support HBCUs and HSIs that offer 
scholarships for students majoring in the aviation field.
    I serve on the House Ag committee, and we have a similar program 
there with our 1890 land grant institutions, and there have been

aside for reliever airports in urban areas experiencing congestion. But 
talking to the reliever airports, you wouldn't know that program 
exists, because the set-aside for these critical institutions, is two 
thirds of 1% of discretionary funds.
    That is why I am calling on the committee to triple the funding for 
these reliever airports in urban congested areas to 2%. By tripling the 
amount of money guaranteed to go to these critical facilities, we truly 
create a separate line item. We retain the competitive grant process, 
but ensure that reliever airports aren't just fighting over scraps, and 
forced to go against the big guys for any real money.
    Though they may be small, they are mighty. Reliever airports are 
the essential lynch pin that allow planes to land and takeoff at the 
scheduled times in our larger airports. I urge the committee to 
increase the reliever airport set-aside so that families do not suffer 
from missed flights, missed connections, and missed opportunities.
    While I bring these urgent needs to the committee, I do so 
recognizing that there are of course many other urgent priorities that 
my constituents, aviation stakeholders, and Americans across the 
country, hope to see in the 2023 Bill. As a Member of the House 
Agriculture Committee, I have to mention the importance of supporting 
Sustainable Aviation Fuels.
    Not only is this a key priority identified by airports, airlines, 
and manufacturers alike, but it allows us to provide domestic, 
sustainable fuel. For those not immersed in commodity policy, SAF comes 
from the oil byproduct of soybeans grown right here in the US.
    In addition, we clearly need Next-Gen technology upgrades. We all 
experienced the confusion and loss that outdated technology can cause, 
which is why I hope the committee fully funds programs that upgrade 
outdated technology.
    Finally let me say that none of this would be possible without the 
people on the ground and in the air actually doing the work day to day. 
I strongly urge the committee to work with workers to ensure that our 
aviation workers are supported in the 2023 FAA Reauthorization.
    With all that said, I am happy to discuss any of this further, and 
just want to underscore the importance of investing in HBCUs, HSIs, and 
Reliever Airports.

    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you very much, Ms. Crockett.
    Any questions?
    Seeing none, thank you for coming in, and we will make sure 
your testimony gets in the record. So, thanks for being here, 
Jasmine.
    Next up we have Representative Sherrill from New Jersey.
    Thanks for being here. Five minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. MIKIE SHERRILL, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                        FROM NEW JERSEY

    Ms. Sherrill. Thank you so much. Thank you, Chairman 
Graves.
    And thank you, Mr. Carbajal and members of the committee 
for providing me with the opportunity to testify today.
    I also want to thank my good friends and colleagues from 
New Jersey, Representatives Payne and Menendez, for their 
outstanding work to support our State's priorities on this 
committee.
    I am going to begin today by highlighting the devastating 
impact of the pandemic on my constituents' current access to 
affordable and reliable commuting options. Commuter bus and 
rail lines have been hit exceptionally hard over the past 3 
years, as millions of Americans have stopped going into the 
office. And even as public health conditions have improved, 
these companies continue to deal with ridership that is far 
below pre-pandemic levels.
    This slow return to normalcy is now causing many operators, 
including a key bus provider in my district, to permanently 
shutter critical commuter routes that are relied upon by 
thousands of families. That company in my district has been 
shuttling New Jerseyans to Manhattan since 1870, when it was 
founded as a stagecoach company. Not only has this left riders 
in search of options to make their way from North Jersey to 
Manhattan, it has imperiled the good union jobs that the 
commuter service provides.
    Congress and this committee played a crucial role during 
the pandemic in protecting access to bus and rail commuter 
routes through their creation of the Coronavirus Economic 
Relief for Transportation Services program, CERTS, which 
ensured that bus carriers could continue providing crucial 
commuter services, and protected the jobs of thousands of 
workers. Significant and bipartisan funding to State public 
transit agencies through several COVID relief packages also 
helped those agencies to maintain reliable service, even as 
ridership collapsed.
    In keeping with these critical efforts, I now urge this 
committee, alongside the Department of Transportation, to take 
all available actions to protect commuter bus and transit 
access. This should include any necessary support to State 
public transit agencies to ensure that key commuter routes 
relied upon by families are still able to operate, as well as 
additional funding for Federal Transit Administration grant 
programs that fund public transportation operations in heavily 
trafficked areas.
    My constituents and so many millions of families nationwide 
rely on affordable transportation to make ends meet, and we 
cannot allow the pandemic to further impact their quality of 
life as we get back to normal.
    Another issue before this committee that is critical to my 
district's economy and the standard of living of my 
constituents, which you have heard about from me before, is the 
Gateway Tunnel project, the Nation's most critical 
infrastructure project. As you know, the Northeast Corridor is 
the most heavily trafficked rail corridor in the Nation and is 
crucial to the travel and livelihoods of millions of Americans 
in our region, moving a workforce that adds more than $50 
billion annually to the U.S. economy.
    The Gateway project, and specifically the Hudson River 
tunnel, is the linchpin at the center of this network. But the 
tunnel is over a century old and was heavily damaged by 
Superstorm Sandy, creating the risk of a devastating failure 
that could cost American businesses and households $16 billion 
over 4 years and reduced property values by $22 billion in New 
Jersey alone.
    The Hudson River tunnel project will eliminate the risk of 
this potential closure and significantly expand capacity along 
the Northeast Corridor by doubling the number of trains able to 
travel under the Hudson. Amtrak estimates that the project will 
produce a return on investment to our region of 4-to-1 from 
reduced travel costs and times, greater travel safety, and 
reduced highway congestion. The project is also projected to 
create over 55,000 good-paying jobs for our constituents.
    I have been really excited by this committee's bipartisan 
work to include significant funding within the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law to fund Gateway, as well as by the 
administration's efforts to expedite approvals of the project's 
Environmental Impact Statement and Project Development 
Agreement. But our work is not yet done. The Federal Transit 
Administration still needs to finalize its risk assessments for 
the project, and award already appropriated grants to the 
Gateway Development Commission to allow construction to begin 
as soon as this summer.
    I strongly urge this committee to continue advocating for 
Gateway and overseeing the delivery of grant funding for the 
crucial project to ensure that we can realize its historic 
benefits as soon as possible.
    I am so appreciative of the tremendous leadership that this 
committee has demonstrated in support of commuter transit and 
the Gateway project over the past 3 years, and I look forward 
to continuing to engage with all of you on these critical 
issues.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.

TESTIMONY OF HON. MARY E. MILLER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. Thank you. Chairman Graves and 
Ranking Member Larsen, thank you for the opportunity to testify 
on behalf of Illinois' 15th Congressional District.
    Today, I would like to highlight the importance of levee 
districts like Sny Island based near Quincy, Illinois. The 
levees along the Mississippi River protect critical road and 
rail infrastructure, thousands of acres of farmland, and 
countless homes and businesses from routine flooding. Levee 
districts like Sny face significant challenges, including 
record-high diesel prices and shortages of skilled engineering 
workers.
    In recent years, the Sny has also faced heightened 
regulatory headwinds under the U.S. Army Corps section 408 
regulations. Levee district operators frequently face 
permitting delays or even denials for routine maintenance and 
improvements to their levee systems, leading to increased flood 
risk for local communities.
    The current interpretation of section 408 has the potential 
for significant negative impact on the ability of levee 
districts like Sny Island to maintain their 100-year flood 
accreditation. Loss of FEMA accreditation reduces land value by 
as much as half, with significant negative consequences to 
agriculture and the local tax base.
    I ask that the committee consider clarifying the 
jurisdiction that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has over 
local levee sponsors. The committee has an opportunity during 
WRDA to prohibit the retroactive application of section 408 to 
levee systems modified prior to the first issuance of the 
regulation in 2006. I urge the committee to affirm 
congressional intent and fix the misapplication of section 408.
    Again, I thank you for your consideration and the chance to 
speak to the committee today. As a member of the Agriculture 
Committee, I look forward to working with the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee to address this issue, which is 
critically important to Illinois and to every other State with 
river flood protection systems. Thank you.
    [Mrs. Miller of Illinois' prepared statement follows:]

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Mary E. Miller, a Representative in Congress 
                       From the State of Illinois
    Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen: thank you for the 
opportunity to testify on behalf of Illinois' 15th District.
    On behalf of my constituents, I would like to highlight the 
importance of Mississippi levee drainage districts like Sny Island, 
based near Quincy, Illinois. The levees along the Mississippi River 
protect critical road and rail infrastructure, thousands of acres of 
farmland, and countless homes and businesses from routine flooding. 
They are essential to the economy of western Illinois, as well as the 
economies of nine other states along the Mississippi River.
    Levee drainage districts like the Sny face significant challenges 
to their operations, including record high diesel prices and shortages 
of skilled engineering workers. In recent years, the Sny has also faced 
heightened regulatory headwinds under the US Army Corps of 
Engineering's Section 408 regulations. Levee drainage district 
operators frequently face permitting delays or even denials for routine 
maintenance and improvements to their levee systems, leading to 
increased flood risk for local communities.
    The current interpretation of Section 408 has the potential for 
significant negative impact on the ability of levee drainage districts 
like Sny Island to maintain their FEMA 100-year flood accreditation. 
Local levee sponsors, which presently fall under the purported 
jurisdiction of Section 408, face federal permitting denials when 
seeking to increase levee height to maintain their 100-year flood 
protection. Loss of accreditation on FEMA flood maps reduces land value 
by as much as half, with significant negative consequences to 
agriculture and the local tax base.
    I ask that the Committee consider clarifying the jurisdiction that 
the US Army Corps of Engineering has over local levee sponsors. The 
Committee has an opportunity during WRDA 2024 to prohibit the 
retroactive application of Section 408 to levee systems modified prior 
to the first issuance of the regulation in 2006. I urge the Committee 
to affirm Congressional intent and fix the misapplication of Section 
408. This will protect the ability of levee drainage districts like Sny 
Island to operate long into the future.
    Again, I thank you for your consideration and the chance to speak 
to the Committee today. As a member of the Agriculture Committee, I 
look forward to working with the Transportation Committee to address 
this issue, which is critically important to Illinois, and every other 
state with river flood protection systems. Thank you.

    Mr. Collins. Thank you.
    Are there any questions?
    Hearing none, I thank you, Mrs. Miller. We will make sure 
that your testimony is included in the record.
    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. Thank you.
    Mr. Collins. Yes, ma'am. The Chair now recognizes Mr.

TESTIMONY OF HON. EARL L. ``BUDDY'' CARTER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
               CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA

    Mr. Carter of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And let me 
say what a pleasure it is to see you sitting in the chairman's 
seat less than 3 months into your first term. I am so 
impressed. Thank you. Thank you, seriously, and members of the 
committee, for letting us share today our priorities before the 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
    The work that this committee does is extremely important, 
incredibly important, especially now. Our country has made 
significant investments in our infrastructure through the IIJA, 
and it is incredibly important that you oversee and ensure that 
those funds and programs are properly administered to the 
benefit of the American people. For better or worse, there are 
billions of taxpayer dollars appropriated towards improving our 
infrastructure, and we must seize the opportunity to spend it 
wisely in a way that serves our country the best. And you all 
do that, and I want to thank you for that.
    As the Representative of the entire coast of Georgia--and, 
Mr. Chairman, you are very aware of my district, and you know 
that it is one of the most growing areas in our State and in 
our region--we just had the single largest economic development 
project ever announced for our district in the State of 
Georgia. And it is in the First Congressional District with 
Hyundai building a new EV plant there that is going to be a 
$5.5 billion investment with over 8,100 jobs and probably that 
many more in the way of ancillary businesses.
    Therefore, infrastructure, as you can imagine, is extremely 
important to us. It is also important because we are on the 
coast. The consideration of the Water Resources Development 
Act--and that is an opportunity to maintain and improve the 
pristine coastline that I have called home all of my life. 
Programs authorized by WRDA like beach renourishment projects 
and coastal storm risk management on Tybee Island and 
Cumberland Island protect our shoreline from the varying 
challenges posed by the Atlantic Ocean, especially hurricanes.
    WRDA also provides the authorizations for the continued 
improvements to the two major ports along our coast. Remember, 
we have the Port of Savannah, the number three container port 
in the country, the single largest and fastest growing 
container terminal in America. And it handles 1 out of every 
8.8 loaded 20-foot equivalent container units in the U.S. now. 
And then we have the Port of Brunswick, which is the number two 
roll-on roll-off port in terms of cars and trucks that come 
through this country.
    Combined, Georgia's deepwater ports and inland barge 
terminals support more than 561,000 jobs throughout the State 
annually, and they contribute $33 billion in income, $140 
billion in revenue, and $3.8 billion in State and local taxes 
to Georgia's economy. This would not be possible without your 
work on WRDA.
    A year ago this March, we completed the Savannah Harbor 
expansion project, allowing larger ships to come to Savannah. 
As you can imagine, ships have only continued to get larger, 
which is why I ask the committee to continue to support the 
implementation of the new Harbor Modification Study authorized 
in the 2022 WRDA. This will allow the United States to remain 
globally competitive as we continue to grow, especially in the 
Southeast.
    I also ask for the committee's continued support for the 
authorized construction for modifications to the Port of 
Brunswick as it continues to grow, as well. These are projects 
through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and I would also ask 
that you support them to fulfill their mission. Specifically in 
the Savannah District that serves our district, the U.S. Army 
Corps is essential to completing the permits for a wide array 
of projects, from bulkheads to debris removal to wetland 
mitigation credits. They need the resources to ensure all of 
this is done in a timely manner. Otherwise, it hinders the 
development of our region.
    As our part of the State and county grow and the country 
grows, it is important that it has the resources to do so. Many 
of my areas in my district are rural and experiencing 
significant growth now, but this puts significant strains on 
their infrastructure, particularly water systems. Places like 
Bryan County in my district, where Hyundai, as I mentioned 
before, has started the largest economic development project in 
the State's history. They need the support to manage the 
incoming growth. Or cities like Nahunta and Darien in my 
district that are much smaller, but don't have the resources to 
update aging systems. That is why I ask the committee to 
continue its support for the Clean Water SRF program that helps 
these communities improve their water systems.
    Lastly, I will note that we also have several airports in 
our district that will be watching FAA reauthorization closely. 
I ask the committee appropriately fund the Airport Improvement 
Program to provide the necessary resources to these airports 
that face increased traffic and demands.
    Technologies like advanced digital construction management 
systems have been approved for use by the Federal Highway 
Administration and Federal Transit Administration, and they 
could provide similar benefits to airports.
    Your committee will certainly be busy tackling these issues 
and more, and I want to thank you again for your important work 
to this important infrastructure in our district, and thank you 
for the opportunity to present today, and I yield back.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. JACK BERGMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN

    Mr. Bergman. Thank you, Chairman and Ranking Member, for 
giving me the opportunity to testify this morning.
    As a lifelong professional aviator, both military and 
commercial, I have seen firsthand the evolution of air travel 
in the United States. From the first commercial flight in 1914 
to the dawn of the jet age today, one constant has remained: We 
have strived and succeeded in making air travel as safe as 
possible.
    And just for the record, I would like to note that in 1914, 
I was not the pilot, nor was Ranking Member Carbajal the 
passenger.
    Since our last major aviation accident, Colgan Air flight 
3407, which killed 49 passengers and crew and 1 person on the 
ground, there have been 2 fatalities in domestic commercial air 
travel over 13 years. This incredibly impressive safety record 
is not an aberration or an accident. It is due to an 
unrelenting focus by Congress, the FAA, our pilots, and the 
airlines to ensure the safety of the flying public. Each 
incident over the last 100-plus years of commercial flight has 
taught us lessons that we have incorporated into policy 
changes, aircraft design innovations, and new training methods.
    As this committee begins work on the FAA reauthorization 
bill, I would like to ask that committee members keep safety 
top in your minds. After the Colgan Air crash, Congress made 
significant changes, including requiring 1,500 hours of flight 
time before a first officer can fly for a U.S. commercial 
carrier, increased rest periods for pilots, and enhanced pilot 
training. It is clear these changes have and will continue to 
make air travel safer.
    I would argue that the most important provision of the 2010 
FAA reauthorization bill was increasing the number of hours 
pilots have to spend flying prior to entering commercial 
aviation. There is no simulator or classroom that can replace 
being in the cockpit of an aircraft, whether you are above the 
clouds, in the clouds, or below the clouds in significantly 
horrifically bad weather. While classroom training and 
simulators are an incredible tool for pilots to learn and train 
for scenarios that would be unsafe or not feasible, they cannot 
replicate the real thing.
    Many Members have expressed concerns about a pilot 
shortage, and use this as a basis to look at ways to increase 
the number of new pilots. It is no secret that nearly every 
industry has struggled to meet labor needs post-pandemic. In 
fact, 2019 to 2021, domestic carriers saw 9,671 pilots retire. 
During that same period, however, the FAA's civil airmen chart 
shows 15,591 new air transport pilot licenses were issued. That 
is 6,000 pilots more than the number that retired.
    While there may be a labor shortage impacting the number of 
flights that U.S. carriers can schedule, it is not due to a 
lack of qualified pilots. It is imperative that we do not 
sacrifice flight-hour requirements and passenger safety to fix 
a problem that doesn't exist.
    While I love my decades of flying commercial aircraft, I 
knew I couldn't do it forever. In 2007, at the age of 60, the 
mandatory retirement age at the time, I retired from Northwest 
Airlines. Later that year, Congress passed a bill to align with 
ICAO standards and increase the retirement age to 65, where it 
stands today. You cannot replace the experience of an older 
pilot. But as we age, our health risks increase. And at a 
certain point, those risks outweigh the wealth of knowledge and 
experience that older pilots have.
    If the retirement age were raised, senior commercial 
aviators who tend to fly larger aircraft on international 
routes would only be able to serve domestic destinations and a 
couple of countries that allow a retirement age over 65. This 
would force seasoned pilots into new, potentially unfamiliar 
aircraft with an elevated risk of health emergency, while also 
delaying the progression of the more junior pilots.
    There have been around 8 billion domestic enplanements 
since the last multiple fatality aviation accident in the 
United States. But that doesn't mean we should rest on our 
laurels and relax commonsense requirements. We set the gold 
standard for global aviation safety and produce the best pilots 
in the world. As you craft the FAA reauthorization bill, I hope 
that you will build on the success these carefully crafted laws 
have brought to the entire aviation industry and not jeopardize 
the safety of our pilots, crews, and especially our passengers.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you this 
morning.

    [Recess.]
    Mr. Collins. The Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure will reconvene the previously recessed hearing.
    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Roy from Texas for 5 minutes.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. CHIP ROY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM 
                       THE STATE OF TEXAS

    Mr. Roy. I thank the chairman, and I thank you for your 
time. It is an honor to appear before the committee.
    As the chair knows, I represent central Texas, and that 
includes San Antonio. San Antonio proudly refers to itself as 
Military City U.S.A., home to numerous bases, one of which I 
represent, Fort Sam Houston, as a part of Joint Base San 
Antonio, which includes an enormous number of other Air Force 
bases, including Randolph, where my mom grew up as a child of 
an Air Force veteran, and she grew up as an Air Force brat.
    A problem that we face is that we do not have a direct 
flight from San Antonio, the seventh largest city in the United 
States, to Reagan National Airport. We believe that is 
something that needs to change. You cannot have a city that is 
the seventh largest city that is as proximate to the Nation's 
Capital, where you have the significant number--we have an 
estimated 80,000 Active Duty servicemembers and 159,000 
veterans, enormous military and defense installations, and all 
of the various cybersecurity and all the defense contractors 
that operate in and around the bases in San Antonio that are 
looking to get to Reagan and land a mere mile from the 
Pentagon, rather than having to land at Dulles or BWI.
    Now, we have dealt with this kind of thing before. I live a 
little closer to Austin. I represent San Antonio and the outer 
edges of Austin, so, I tend to fly on the one direct flight we 
have from Austin to Reagan. We literally only have one, a 
Southwest flight that goes down, and it comes up to DC and goes 
back every day. And when I am stuck, and then I have to go fly 
to--the direct that United has out in Dulles, or there is some 
other Southwest flights that are direct to BWI, but we have got 
Honor Flights that aren't able to come from San Antonio easily 
with our old veterans being able to come up here to Reagan.
    And it is a problem that can be solved, because the barrier 
to achieving it is actually legislative, because we have got 
some legacy rules. The perimeter rule, which sets the barrier 
for 1,250 miles in terms of the distance that you can fly into 
Reagan, a number of cities have exceptions, Austin being one of 
them. Others that are capitals--Denver, other places, Salt Lake 
City--I won't go through the whole list, there is a number of 
cities that have exceptions. So, we are looking either for San 
Antonio to have an exception for that, or otherwise change the 
perimeter rule.
    And then there is the slot rule, which restricts the number 
of takeoffs and landings at DCA, at Reagan during a given hour. 
These are all things that can be dealt with legislatively. I 
just ask the committee to please consider taking that up. It 
seems parochial, and some--I guess, by definition, it is. There 
are Members of Congress who are trying to do that.
    But it actually is really important for our national 
security and our Nation to have the seventh largest city that 
has those important military installations in San Antonio have 
a direct flight to Reagan to be able to land and take off less 
than a mile from the Pentagon. We think that is critically 
important. And I would just ask for that consideration, and I'm 
happy to work with anybody on the committee to try to 
effectuate that change.
    We know there are some lobby powers around this town that 
like to have their interests protected, perhaps somebody who 
likes having their direct flights to Dulles, and they don't 
want a competitive direct flight to Reagan. I get it. But I 
would just say, using myself as an example out of Austin, I 
take that direct flight Southwest to DCA, but I often take the 
United direct flight to Dulles. Having those options is great. 
Sometimes I might have an event in northern Virginia, and 
Dulles is better. Sometimes it is just a better time, and I 
don't mind driving in and out of there.
    But it is, I think, on the border of absurd that we don't 
at least have the ability to have a direct flight option from 
San Antonio with that military center of gravity to be able to 
come up to Reagan right there by the Pentagon.
    And with that, I would yield back and appreciate the 
chair's time.
    [Mr. Roy's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Chip Roy, a Representative in Congress From 
                           the State of Texas
    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the 
committee to testify on an issue that is incredibly important to my 
constituents and South Texas--the need for a direct, nonstop flight 
between San Antonio International Airport (SAT) and Ronald Reagan 
Washington National Airport (DCA).
    San Antonio and Bexar County are home to 80,000 active-duty service 
members, 159,000 veterans, and Joint Base San Antonio--which is why we 
call it ``Military City USA.'' San Antonio is also home to the second 
largest cybersecurity community in the country, outside of Washington, 
D.C.
    San Antonio's defense, veteran, and cybersecurity presence, in 
addition to its robust business community, means there is significant 
travel demand to and from San Antonio and Washington, D.C. 
Unfortunately, there is no nonstop flight between SAT and DCA--the 
closest airport to both the Pentagon and downtown Washington, D.C.
    Multiple airlines have expressed serious interest in operating a 
direct flight between SAT and DCA, but the federal slot and perimeter 
rules for DCA have precluded them from doing so. As such, I look 
forward to working with the committee, my colleagues in the San Antonio 
delegation, and the rest of Congress to ensure we reach a legislative 
solution to this problem.

    Mr. Collins. Thank you, Mr. Roy.
    Does anybody have any questions?
    All right, thank you. We will make sure your testimony is 
included in the record.
    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Kilmer from Washington for 5 
minutes.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. DEREK KILMER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                  FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Mr. Kilmer. Thank you, Chairman, and thank you for hosting 
today's Member Day.
    I am here today because I represent a region that is 
especially vulnerable to natural disasters. And obviously, 
airports are critical to our emergency preparedness and to 
disaster response. Unfortunately, airports are not immune to 
the impact of natural disasters, nor to the impacts of climate 
change. But they are charged with responding to disaster and 
evacuation events.
    With that in mind, I think it is important that Congress 
steps up to ensure that airports have the resources that they 
need to continue their mission. An example from my neck of the 
woods, Fairchild International Airport in Port Angeles, 
Washington, where I grew up, is on the Olympic Peninsula. 
Fairchild Airport, in addition to being a significant economic 
driver, is also a vital emergency lifeline. In our rural area, 
the region's residents rely on Fairchild to quickly reach 
advanced medical care at hospitals in larger cities that may 
otherwise be hours away by car.
    On top of that, in the event of a natural disaster such as 
a major seismic event or a wildfire--two threats that are, 
unfortunately, very real in our neck of the woods--the airport 
is designated by FEMA as an emergency staging area, and it is 
expected to serve the region by distributing supplies and other 
vital services.
    In other words, ensuring the resiliency of this airport and 
others guarantees the resiliency of our communities.
    We know that many more communities across the country face 
these resiliency challenges with their local airports also 
taking up the task. So, I am introducing a bill called the 
Resilient Airports Act, alongside my colleague and your fellow 
committee member, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon. This bill is based 
on a provision in the Moving Forward Act that I worked on with 
the Aviation Subcommittee in the 117th Congress.
    Specifically, it would expand Airport Improvement Program 
eligibility for critical infrastructure projects that increase 
the resiliency of airports against earthquakes and hurricanes 
and flooding and tornadoes and other natural disasters.
    On top of that, it would ensure that general aviation 
airports that are designated as a Federal staging area by FEMA, 
like the Fairchild Airport in Port Angeles, would be included 
in this eligibility. That is important because it ensures that 
all airports that are charged with emergency and disaster 
response, including those that serve rural communities, are 
included in this opportunity to build resiliency and to 
continue to serve their communities.
    So, I look forward to introducing this legislation in the 
coming weeks, and would love to encourage the committee to 
consider its inclusion in the upcoming FAA reauthorization.
    Again, I appreciate your leadership and your consideration 
of these requests. I am happy to provide any additional 
information to the committee for your review, and thanks again 
for the opportunity to testify.
    [Mr. Kilmer's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Derek Kilmer, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of Washington
    Chair Graves, Ranking Member Cohen, and Members of the Aviation 
Subcommittee, thank you for hosting today's Member Day hearing and 
thank you for your work and leadership.
    I am here today because I represent a region that is especially 
vulnerable to natural disasters, and I know how critical our airports 
are to our emergency preparedness and disaster response. Unfortunately, 
airports are not immune to the impact of natural disasters and climate 
change--but they are charged with responding to disaster and evacuation 
events. With that in mind, it's critical that Congress steps up to 
ensure that airports have the resources they need to continue this 
important mission.
    An example in my neck of the woods is the Fairchild International 
Airport in Port Angeles, Washington--where I grew up--on the Olympic 
Peninsula. The Fairchild Airport, in addition to being an economic 
driver, is also a vital emergency lifeline. In this rural area, the 
region's residents rely on Fairchild to quickly reach advanced medical 
care at hospitals in larger cities that may otherwise be hours away by 
car. Additionally, in the event of a natural disaster such as a major 
seismic event or wildfire, two threats of disaster that are very real 
in the Pacific Northwest, the airport is designated by FEMA as an 
emergency staging area and expected to serve the region by distributing 
supplies and other vital services. In other words, ensuring the 
resiliency of this airport in turn guarantees the resiliency of this 
community.
    We also know that many more communities across the country face 
these resiliency challenges, with their local airports also taking up 
the task. That's why I'm pleased to be introducing a bill called the 
Resilient Airports Act alongside my colleague, Representative Earl 
Blumenauer of Oregon. This bill is based on a provision in the Moving 
Forward Act that I was pleased to work on with the Aviation 
Subcommittee in the 117th Congress. Specifically, it would expand 
Airport Improvement Program (AIP) eligibility for critical 
infrastructure projects that increase the resiliency of airports 
against earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, tornadoes, and other natural 
disasters. Furthermore, it would ensure that General Aviation airports 
that are designated as a federal staging area by FEMA, like the 
Fairchild Airport in Port Angeles, are included in this eligibility. 
This is important because it ensures that all airports charged with 
emergency and disaster response, including those that serve rural 
communities, are included in this opportunity to build resiliency and 
serve their communities. I look forward to introducing this legislation 
in the coming weeks and encourage the subcommittee to consider its 
inclusion in the upcoming FAA reauthorization.
    I greatly appreciate your leadership, partnership, and your 
consideration of these requests and I am happy to provide additional 
information as you review them. Thank you again for the opportunity to 
testify before the subcommittee today.

    Mr. Edwards [presiding]. Thank you, Representative Kilmer.
    Does any Member have any questions?
    Thank you, Representative Kilmer. We will make sure that 
your testimony is included in our record.
    All right, next we have Representative Sherman from 
California.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. BRAD SHERMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                  FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Mr. Sherman. Thank you. We need to tell the FAA to care as 
much about people on the ground as they do people in the air.
    Increases in air traffic and adjustments in flightpaths are 
causing serious injury to the quality of life in neighborhoods 
I represent in the San Fernando Valley and in other areas 
around the country. Residents have extensively documented 
reported new and substantial impacts to various communities 
from noise and pollution from these increasing flights. There 
have been several public forums, multiple bills introduced in 
Congress, a GAO audit, and lawsuits filed by the city of Los 
Angeles.
    The FAA should hear us, but perhaps they can't hear us over 
the noise generated by Van Nuys and Burbank Airports. It is 
time for the FAA to take health and safety concerns of people 
on the ground seriously.
    Nationally, and especially in my district, performance-
based navigation systems have led to the creation of more 
precise flightpaths, resulting in the concentration of noise 
and associated pollution over smaller and more narrow areas. 
Concentration of noise leads to nonstop bombardment of 
particular neighborhoods, kind of a hostile takeover of the 
quality of life, including sleepless nights and an inability to 
hold conversations in one's own home.
    We must provide local airports with the ability to disperse 
both arrivals and departures if they have proposals that can be 
implemented safely. That should be included in FAA 
reauthorization. And if the FAA is going to reject such 
proposals from local airports, they should have to substantiate 
why.
    We should expand section 175 of the last reauthorization 
act to require the FAA to consider the feasibility of dispersal 
headings, both departures and arrivals, submitted for 
consideration by airport operators.
    If a challenge to reducing noise is rooted in deconflicting 
airspace, then we must hire more air traffic controllers, 
particularly to staff the terminal radar approach control 
facilities. The FAA needs to hire more air traffic controllers, 
both for the safety of those in the air and those on the 
ground.
    In recent years, and thanks to a GAO audit, more attention 
has been drawn to faulty noise metrics used by the FAA to 
justify its decisions, including the day-night average sound 
level, which I would quote the GAO, ``does not provide a clear 
picture of flight activity or associated noise levels at a 
given location.''
    I supported Congresswoman Meng's bill, the Decrease Noise 
Levels Act, and I would invite you to include that in your FAA 
reauthorization.
    Too often, the FAA fails to conduct an environmental 
assessment review, citing their rights to categorically exclude 
certain changes. We have learned the hard way that a cursory 
environmental review locks in impacts that can be very harmful 
to constituents.
    Almost lastly, everyone deserves a good night's sleep. And 
those who are bombarded with noise all day should not be 
bombarded with noise, and their houses should not shake, at 
night. In the San Fernando Valley, this is what happens. We 
have introduced the Valley-Wide Noise Relief Act, myself and 
Mr. Schiff.
    But I particularly focus your attention on the Restore 
Everyone's Sleep Tonight Act, the REST Act, put forward by our 
colleague Jackie Speier, who is not with us. And that bill 
authorizes airports to have curfews between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. 
Unfortunately, this legislation did not receive a floor vote. 
We must restore local community control to the airports. Only 
those in localities can balance the needs of air transportation 
with the needs of homeowners in the area. We need the FAA 
reauthorization bill to provide an allowance for night-time 
curfews.
    So many of the issues I have described are rooted in the 
FAA's unwillingness to incorporate input from those affected by 
aviation noise and other health impacts. Last year, I joined 
with my colleagues in the Quiet Skies Caucus in calling on the 
FAA to establish an advisory committee of 30 citizens who live 
in communities impacted by airport noise and other key 
stakeholders, and that needs to be part of your reauthorization 
bill, as well, a citizens advisory committee.
    Thank you very much.
    [Mr. Sherman's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Brad Sherman, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of California
    Increases in air traffic and adjustments to flight paths are 
causing serious injury to the quality of life in neighborhoods 
throughout my own district in the San Fernando Valley, and in many 
other areas around the country.
    Residents have extensively documented and reported new and 
substantial impacts to our community from the noise and pollution 
issuing from the increasingly congested airspace overhead.
    There have been several public forums, multiple bills introduced in 
Congress, a GAO audit of the FAA, and a lawsuit filed by the City of 
Los Angeles.
    The FAA knows about the problem, but it has failed to act.
    It is time for the FAA to take the health and safety concerns of 
people on the ground seriously and to take immediate action to address 
them.
    Nationally, and especially in my district, performance-based 
navigation systems have led to the creation of more precise flight 
patterns, resulting in concentration of noise and associated pollution 
over smaller areas. This is no small thing. Concentration of noise 
leads to a non-stop aviation noise bombardment of particular 
neighborhoods, a hostile takeover of quality of life, including 
sleepless nights and the inability to hold conversations in one's own 
home.
    Despite efforts to gaslight my constituents, and to suggest that 
there are no real noise impacts and certainly not unannounced changes 
to paths, the FAA has formally acknowledged what has been called a 
``southern shift'' in one particular flight path over my district, 
introducing thousands of constituents to not just new noise, but hyper-
concentrated new noise.
    We must provide local airports with the ability to disperse both 
arrivals and departures if they have proposals that can be implemented 
safely. And if the FAA wants to reject such proposals, then they should 
have to substantiate such decisions.
    So, we should expand Section 175 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 
2018, to require the FAA to consider the feasibility of dispersal 
headings submitted for consideration by airport operators.
    In my advocacy on behalf of constituents seeking relief from new 
and unyielding aviation noise and health impacts, I have been 
consistently told by the FAA to accept the status quo because the 
airspace over my constituent's homes is simply too complex to alter 
flight paths. Indeed, my constituents and I live in a large 
metropolitan area with air traffic headed to and from three sizable 
airports: LAX, Hollywood-Burbank and Van Nuys.
    If a challenge to reducing noise is rooted in deconflicting the 
airspace, then we simply must hire many more air traffic controllers, 
particularly to staff Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities, also 
known as TRACON.\1\ Hiring additional controllers is not just about 
noise. Air traffic control, of course, is essential to safety, 
especially over complex airspace. The FAA must hire more air traffic 
controllers to deconflict airspace and safeguard our skies and the 
ground below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ ``The fiscal 2023 omnibus funded the hiring of 1,500 new air 
traffic controllers and the president is seeking appropriations to hire 
another 1,800 next year.'' FAA is Facing a Looming Staffing Crisis as 
Post-Pandemic Needs Grow--Government Executive (govexec.com)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In recent years, and thanks to a GAO audit, more attention has been 
drawn to faulty noise metrics used by the FAA to justify decisions, 
including the use of day-night average sound level, DNL, which, and I 
quote the GAO, ``does not provide a clear picture of flight activity or 
associated noise levels at a given location.'' In the 116th Congress, I 
supported Rep. Meng's bill, the Decrease Noise Levels Act, which would 
have directed the FAA to revise its use of noise metrics.\2\ I support 
that bill today and look forward to working with Congresswoman Meng to 
reintroduce it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ ``This bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
to revise its regulations to decrease the threshold for the day-night 
average sound level that constitutes significant noise from 65 decibels 
to 60 decibels, and adjust relative ranges of day-night average sound 
level accordingly.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Too often, the FAA fails to conduct an Environmental Assessment of 
new procedures, citing ``CATEX''--the ability to ``categorically 
exclude'' certain procedures from analysis. The FAA should be required 
to conduct an Environmental Assessment for all new procedures. We've 
learned the hard way, that a cursory environmental review locks in 
impacts that can be far more impactful than constituents are led to 
believe. The FAA can't be allowed to operate on autopilot when it comes 
to new procedures.
    Lastly, everyone deserves the opportunity of a good night's sleep 
and thus communities deserve the opportunity to establish enforceable 
nighttime curfews at local airports.
    In the San Fernando Valley, we are having flights at all hours of 
the day and night. Not only do residents living beneath flight paths 
endure the house-shaking noise of air-traffic during the day, but they 
also suffer the jarring interruption of their sleep at night.
    As a longtime advocate for mandatory nighttime curfews, I have 
twice introduced the standalone legislation the Valley-Wide Noise 
Relief Act together with Congressmember Adam Schiff, which would allow 
for nighttime curfews specifically at Hollywood Burbank and Van Nuys 
airports.
    In 2019 and again in 2021, I joined with colleagues to introduce 
the Restore Everyone's Sleep Tonight Act (or REST Act) [H.R. 5106; 
Speier]. This bill authorizes an airport to impose a curfew between the 
hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. Unfortunately, this legislation never 
received a floor vote. We must restore local control to the community. 
I look forward to working with Congressman Schiff, and with members of 
the committee to reintroduce these bills.
    So many of the issues I've described are rooted in the FAA's 
unwillingness to incorporate input from those affected by aviation 
noise and health impacts. Last year, I joined my colleagues on the 
Quiet Skies Caucus, in calling on the FAA to establish an advisory 
committee of 30 citizens who live in communities impacted by airport 
noise, commensurate to others the FAA considers ``key external 
stakeholders,'' as part of the FAA Noise Policy Review.
    Thank you.

    Mr. Edwards. Thank you.
    Does any Member have any questions?
    Representative Sherman, we appreciate you being here. We 
will make sure that your testimony is included in our record.
    Next up, I would like to recognize my friend and former 
Senate colleague from North Carolina, the Honorable 
Representative Don Davis.
    You have 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. DONALD G. DAVIS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                FROM THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA

    Mr. Davis of North Carolina. Chairman Graves, Ranking 
Member Larsen, and to my colleagues from North Carolina, 
Representative Rouzer and Foushee, and yes, my good friend, 
Representative Edwards--we will make sure that Chairman Graves 
knows that you look comfortable, North Carolina looks 
comfortable in the chair right now.
    I would like to thank all of the distinguished members of 
this committee for allowing me to speak on the issues that 
matter to the residents of North Carolina's First Congressional 
District.
    Much of eastern North Carolina is rural. Our communities 
direly need broadband. The steps this committee takes to roll 
out broadband in rural America will significantly improve the 
lives of families and businesses across my district.
    Also, the committee must leverage the United States Coast 
Guard to further support our national interests. Over the past 
3 years alone, Air Station Elizabeth City completed over 570 
search and recovery or rescue missions that protected 
approximately $850,000 in property, and saved 130 lives. 
Additionally, the base helps with hurricane response and 
recovery.
    Economic development is crucial. The Southeast Crescent 
Regional Commission's mission addresses economic and poverty 
issues in districts like North Carolina's First Congressional 
District. Thirteen of the First Congressional District's 
nineteen counties are economically distressed. Clearly, we need 
help to increase workforce availability, invest in critical 
infrastructure needs, promote business innovation and access to 
capital, and so much more. I ask for you to support the SCRC so 
that our districts, those like mine, can successfully move into 
the 21st century.
    Other significant issues for us include hurricanes and 
flooding. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has done a 
phenomenal job training local government officials to ensure 
these communities have an emergency preparedness plan before 
each event. However, we must enhance recovery procedures. Under 
current law, FEMA can only restore buildings to their previous 
state before an event and cannot make enhancements to 
structures to prevent or mitigate future disasters. We need to 
move upstream, not downstream, and make these structures more 
resilient so that FEMA does not have to pour public dollars 
back into the same buildings that may again come crashing down.
    The Albemarle Sound is vital for our local community 
success, but water levels continue to rise, and permanent 
flooding follows. I ask you to support coastal flood mitigation 
so that my constituents' homes do not end up in the sound.
    The economic well-being and safety of communities go beyond 
FEMA's work. Rail and freight are key parts of that same 
framework. Large amounts of freight are shipped in the 
district. We are vital to the east coast economic engine. 
Economic development is essential along the rail corridor in 
communities that need good-paying jobs. The committee is 
encouraged to support rail and freight shipping to further 
foster economic opportunities while pushing for more rail 
safety measures in rural and low-income communities.
    The final issue noteworthy to highlight today is airport 
infrastructure and the importance of FAA reauthorization. Pitt-
Greenville Airport is a nonhub airport. Like many smaller sized 
airports, it has faced economic challenges since the pandemic, 
losing 50 to 60 percent of air service. While the airport 
sought to use over $1 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
funding to provide more access to additional hangars, it now 
may be forced to allocate these funds for unrelated projects 
that have been delayed. We must allow smaller airports to focus 
on their immediate infrastructure needs in the FAA 
reauthorization package.
    I genuinely appreciate the opportunity to testify before 
the committee today on the critical issues impacting my 
constituents, and I look forward to rolling up my sleeves and 
going to work with you. Thank you so much.
    And Mr. Edwards, I yield back.

Washington, Representative Schrier.
    Dr. Schrier. Schrier.
    Mr. Edwards. Schrier, thank you, for 5 minutes.

  TESTIMONY OF HON. KIM SCHRIER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                  FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Dr. Schrier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to extend 
that same thanks to Chairman Graves and to Ranking Member 
Larsen. I really appreciate the opportunity to come here today 
and testify about my priorities and concerns as a 
Representative of Washington State's Eighth Congressional 
District.
    Washington State, like all others, depends on many facets 
of infrastructure for trade and resiliency and economic 
success. Washington's Eighth Congressional District, my 
district, depends on smooth, connected roads, reliable public 
transportation, comprehensive freight rail to make sure that 
agricultural goods can be transported, economies can grow, and 
communities can get to the services that they need.
    We also depend on critical water infrastructure, especially 
with increasing risk of drought, to allow our agricultural 
communities to flourish and make sure we have drought-resistant 
infrastructure.
    I want to talk about three priorities today. One is the way 
that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is implemented, the 
second is FAA reauthorization, and the third is our critical 
water infrastructure.
    As Ranking Member Larsen knows well from his leadership on 
this issue, small and mid-sized communities play a critical 
role in powering Washington State's economy, and they really 
define the Eighth Congressional District. They face several 
barriers, though, when applying for funding from the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law, including the lack of resources like 
dedicated staff and money to develop a competitive grant 
application. This could be not having the staff to do it, it 
could be not having the finances to do it, it could be just not 
having the prerequisite documentation.
    Financing is also an issue, and some of these grants 
require matching funds which they cannot just keep up with if 
they are a small town. So, having some standardization or 
specific support for those small and mid-sized cities as we 
keep oversight on the law would greatly help these smaller 
communities benefit.
    I also want to emphasize and elevate the importance of fish 
passage in Washington State. For the first time in the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, a new funding stream was 
championed to provide opportunities for salmon passage. This is 
particularly important in our State, where the Supreme Court 
has mandated that culverts be replaced by 2030. And so, we have 
urgency in replacing these.
    Cities and counties are managing a lot of transportation 
and infrastructure pressures, everything from roads to salmon 
passage. And it would be nice for these smaller cities and 
towns to be able to have a way to bring all of these funding 
streams together, especially when they are small and medium-
sized, and don't have the typical resources that a large city 
or county would have. So, some flexibility in matching 
requirements would be very helpful.
    Aviation, as you know, is also critical to Washington 
State. That is the home of Boeing. And it is not just Boeing; 
it is all the small businesses that support Boeing aircraft.
    We also see some struggles at our smaller airports, like 
Pangborn Airport in my district, where we have seen some 
decreases in service in many ways due to a shortage of pilots. 
And that is why we need to think creatively about how to 
incentivize people into this line of work and how to be really 
strategic about recruitment. So, to that end I am working with 
my Republican colleagues to introduce the American Aviator Act.
    This bill, similar to the one introduced by Senators 
Baldwin and Hoeven in the Senate, would establish a flight 
training program for veterans. And this bill presents an 
incredible opportunity for a couple of wins: to harness the 
talent and discipline and experience of our veterans, and 
create an excellent, long-term, full-life career path. So, I 
hope you will consider this as you do the FAA reauthorization.
    Lastly, I wanted to mention WIFIA, the Water Infrastructure 
Finance and Innovation Act, and I have a bill as part of this 
that I intend to introduce in the upcoming months. This makes 
some commonsense fixes, again, to broaden funding eligibility 
so that smaller areas can compete. Small towns just don't have 
the tax base to achieve matching funds. They need longer loan 
repayment periods. And so, this would, again, help small local 
communities compete.
    I want to thank you for your consideration of all of these 
issues. Thank you for your service. Please extend those 
gratitudes to the chairman and ranking member, and thank you 
for your continued oversight of the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law implementation. I look forward to working with you and my 
colleagues in both parties.
    [Dr. Schrier's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Kim Schrier, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of Washington
    Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
    I appreciate the opportunity to testify about my priorities and 
concerns as representative of Washington state's 8th congressional 
district.
    Washington state depends on many facets of infrastructure for its 
trade, resiliency, and economic success. Washington's 8th District, my 
district, depends on smooth, connected roads, reliable public 
transportation, and comprehensive freight rail to ensure agricultural 
goods can be transported, economies can grow, and communities can 
access the services they need. We also depend on our critical water 
infrastructure to allow our agricultural communities to flourish and 
build drought-resistant infrastructure in the West.
              Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Implementation
    As Ranking Member Larsen knows from his leadership on this issue, 
small and mid-size communities play a critical role in powering 
Washington's economy. I am eager to partner with this committee to find 
ways to consolidate, standardize, and streamline grant application 
efforts to ensure all communities can benefit from grant funding under 
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
    Small and mid-sized communities face several barriers when applying 
for funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. One of the 
significant obstacles is the lack of resources and capacity to develop 
competitive grant applications. These communities may not have the 
staff or expertise to navigate the complex application process, which 
can involve detailed planning, engineering, and financial analysis. 
Moreover, many of these communities may not have the necessary data and 
information to meet the eligibility requirements for the grants. For 
example, they may not have conducted a comprehensive transportation or 
infrastructure assessment, which is essential for grant applications. 
Financing is also an issue: Some of these grants require matching funds 
and communities may not have the financial resources to meet the 
matching requirement, making it difficult to compete for the grants. 
Another constraint is when grant programs are reimbursable by DOT which 
I will touch on further in my testimony.
  DOT implementation of Culvert Aquatic Organism Passage (AOP) Program
    In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that Washington state had an 
obligation to restore salmon habitat access to meet its promises to the 
tribes. Washington State will have to replace each fish-blocking 
culvert with a larger design. It's estimated the ruling will require 
replacement of about 1,000 state-owned culverts at a cost of about $4 
billion to the state. The state has until 2030 to meet that 
requirement.
    For the first time, a new funding stream was championed in the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to provide significant funding to remove 
salmon-blocking culverts which will improve thousands of miles of 
salmon habitat. However, my office has heard concerns about how the 
program is structured from local fish passage project sponsors.
    Cities and counties are managing a tremendous amount of aging 
transportation infrastructure. Local governments and their associated 
city councils and county commissioners are prioritizing transportation 
projects based on the needs and safety of their traveling public. These 
same local governments also have lists of transportation related fish 
passage barriers, that despite being serviceable, would be a benefit to 
salmon recovery if replaced.
    However, eligibility requirements for executing grant agreements to 
receive Federal Highways Administration (FHWA) funding can take local 
government staff six months to two years to complete at an up-front 
cost of $100k. I am also deeply concerned by the cost share requirement 
and the current administration of grants on a reimbursable basis which 
further constrains the ability of local governments to capitalize on 
these funds. Local governments have a limited capacity for public works 
based on the revenue from local sales and property taxes. Therefore, 
transportation projects done purely for the benefit of salmon recovery 
are addressed when easy to obtain outside funding and staff capacity 
are available. I'd like to see flexibility in the matching requirements 
and other barriers for smaller communities.
         Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization
    Aviation is important to Washington state. From our commercial 
planes used by our constituents every day to the small and mid-sized, 
mission-critical airports used to coordinate firefighting, we need to 
ensure our aviation infrastructure stays strong.
    However, we have recently seen flights cut at some of our smaller 
airports--like Pangborn near Wenatchee--and we have heard continual 
concerns about the lack of airline pilots and shortages in the 
workforce. We need to think creatively about how to incentivize people 
into this work, and how to be strategic about recruitment. As a state 
with high exports, many businesses with international footprints, and 
constituents across the state that want to travel more as we emerge 
from cautions of the pandemics, having consistent, reliable flights is 
essential.
    To that end, I am working with my Republican colleague Kelly 
Armstrong to introduce the American Aviator Act. This bill, a companion 
to Senators Baldwin and Hoeven, would establish a pilot program for 
flight training services to veterans. We have over 500,000 Veterans in 
Washington State, with roughly 50,000 in the 8th District. If you 
dedicated your life to protecting our country, it's our responsibility 
to make sure you receive the best service and care possible. And part 
of a healthy, purposeful life is access to a good job. The bill 
increases career opportunities for veterans and aims to break down 
barriers that may impede veterans from pursuing careers in aviation. 
The bill also helps ensure there is an adequate future supply of 
qualified pilots to continue to provide safe and reliable air service 
to rural airports across the country. I hope you will consider this 
bipartisan, bicameral legislation as you build the FAA reauthorization.
        Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA)
    One of my priorities this Congress is the Water Infrastructure 
Finance and Innovation Act, which I plan to reintroduce in the coming 
months. This bipartisan legislation makes common-sense fixes and 
includes parts of previously introduced legislation to improve the 
Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA), a law 
which created a federal credit program administered by the EPA for 
eligible water and wastewater infrastructure projects.
    Specifically, my WIFIA bill would broaden funding and financing 
eligibility to state and federal projects and entities. This includes 
state-led water storage projects, transferred works of the Bureau of 
Reclamation, and congressionally authorized Army Corps of Engineers 
(USACE) projects. It would also authorize the use of collaborative 
project delivery methods for WIFIA projects, allowing more flexibility 
and reducing time and cost of the project allow certain federal water 
infrastructure loans to have maturity dates of up to 55 years; 
reauthorize USACE WIFIA program through FY2026l and direct the USACE to 
implement its WIFIA program, which it has not done despite its 
authorization in 2014.
    Together, these provisions will allow our local water operators 
access to critical loans and long-term, stable funding for water 
infrastructure projects in Washington state. Funding these local 
projects will keep our water clean and ensure a reliable supply of 
water while keeping costs low for ratepayers.
    Thank you for your consideration of these priorities as you develop 
legislation for our aviation industry and critical water infrastructure 
this year and continue oversight efforts of Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law implementation. I look forward to partnering with you and your 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to deliver for the constituents 
of the 8th district of Washington state.
    Thank you again for your time and consideration.

    Dr. Schrier. And I yield back.
    Mr. Edwards. Thank you, Representative Schrier.
    Does anyone have any questions?
    Mr. Cohen. I would just like to comment how deftly you got 
salmon into funding streams. I was very impressed.
    [Laughter.]
    Dr. Schrier. No pun intended.
    Mr. Edwards. On that jolly note, I can assure you that your 
testimony will be included in our record. Thank you for being 
with us this afternoon.
    Next, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from California, 
Representative Costa, for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. JIM COSTA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM 
                    THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Mr. Costa. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of 
the committee.
    This committee plays an important role in our efforts to 
ensure that we focus on America's infrastructure. And I think 
the passage the last Congress and the bipartisan infrastructure 
package gives us a lot of opportunities to make investments 
that, in part, are long overdue and needed. We have been 
living, in my view, off the investments our parents and 
grandparents made a generation or two ago.
    I want to talk specifically of three areas that this 
committee focuses on: supply chains, the Federal Aviation 
Administration, and water resources development efforts, and 
your oversight in these areas. Obviously, there are other 
important critical areas that you deal with. But I think it is 
important in terms of lessons to be learned during this 
pandemic of the vulnerabilities of our supply chain, both 
interstate, intrastate, as well as our supply chains in terms 
of our ability to export American products.
    I think we have learned a few things--I hope we have--to 
bolster our supply chains internally and our ability to export, 
particularly, around food. Food is a national security issue. 
It doesn't often get looked at that way, but I will tell you, 
we are reauthorizing the farm bill this year, and it is one of 
the more bipartisan things we do. It is a national security 
matter.
    We worked to pass the Ocean Shipping Reform Act in the last 
Congress in a bipartisan fashion with Congress Members 
Garamendi and Dusty Johnson and myself and others to deal with 
the demurrage issue, to deal with the empty container issue. 
But we need to do more.
    We have reintroduced--again, bipartisan--legislation on 
Ocean Shipping Antitrust Enforcement Act. Ten international 
companies control ninety percent of the international shipping 
in the world. And they need to be, I think, held accountable. 
My antitrust legislation would do that.
    The SHIP IT Act is a must-pass bill that you are 
considering that deals with modernizing America's trucking 
system through a series of commonsense measures that reflect 
the 21st century. And I think this is bipartisan, as well.
    Let me move on to water. As you know, we have had extreme 
weather conditions across the country, extreme droughts, 
extreme flooding. We have prayed and prayed and prayed in 
California for rain over the last 3 years, and we must have 
prayed really good, because the last 3 months we have had a 
deluge of biblical proportions.
    But the snowpack is also creating a series of flooding in 
my district and other places that we need to deal with in terms 
of the Army Corps of Engineers for flood management, for levee 
repairs, and recovery.
    We also need to look at regions of the country, including 
my area, where we need to have a regional flood plan. And we 
should work on this. And I want to provide support for the Army 
Corps of Engineers to do that as you contemplate WRDA for the 
next reauthorization next year. Certainly, there are 
opportunities there for feasibility studies, specifically in my 
constituency, Redbank and Fancher Creeks projects, that would 
add additional recharge.
    We need to recharge our groundwater, whether it is in the 
San Joaquin Valley or in the Midwest or other places where we 
have overdrafted. I liken it to when I was in university, and I 
got my first checking account, and I thought I was pretty hot, 
and my father said, ``You know what? You can only write those 
checks as long as you are making deposits.'' And that is the 
problem with the overdrafting of our groundwater.
    So, we need to do a lot there, I think, in infrastructure 
and finance innovation, and we have a program to introduce a 
bipartisan bill on non-Federal entities that manage federally 
owned infrastructure, and that can improve a lot of our aging 
water facilities.
    Finally, under the category of aviation and airport 
improvement projects, I think this committee needs to 
prioritize. I will tell you where I think you need to 
prioritize: areas where we have National Guard facilities 
across this country. Whether it is Air Force or Army Guard 
facilities, they get an incredible deal, our Department of 
Defense, by the municipalities operating these airports 24/7 
for other purposes, as well. And so, these are really important 
bases that our Air National Guard around the country utilizes. 
In Fresno, we have the 144th Air National Guard that has the 
squadrons of F-15 units, and they serve a critical need for our 
national defense.
    So, these are among many of the priorities I would urge you 
to consider, and I will continue to work with this committee as 
we try to continue to invest in America's infrastructure. It is 
absolutely essential.
    [Mr. Costa's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Jim Costa, a Representative in Congress From 
                        the State of California
    Good afternoon, thank you Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member for 
holding this Member Day Hearing. It is critical we continue to work in 
a bipartisan fashion towards addressing our nation's infrastructure 
needs. I look forward to working with the committee and colleagues on 
shared goals such as: improving our supply chains, enhancing our 
nation's water infrastructure, and sustainable rail and aviation 
service.
                             Supply Chains
    The COVID-19 pandemic has proven time and time again that it is 
critical we continue to ensure our supply chains are protected. As I 
have always said, food security is national security, and when our food 
supply chain is threatened, we must act. I was thankful to work in a 
bipartisan fashion with Mr. Johnson and Mr. Garamendi on Ocean Shipping 
Reform Act last Congress, and will continue to on Ocean Shipping Reform 
Act 2.0, Ocean Shipping Antitrust Enforcement Act, and SHIP IT Act this 
Congress.
    The Ocean Shipping Reform Act must be implemented to the fullest 
extent possible. The technical additions from Ocean Shipping Reform Act 
2.0 must be passed this year in addition to the Ocean Shipping 
Antitrust Enforcement Act. These bills are critical towards ensuring 
foreign ocean carriers are being held accountable for unfair trade 
practices. The Federal Maritime Commission must be empowered to protect 
fair trade and American business from foreign adversaries.
    Additionally, the SHIP IT Act is a must-pass bill this Congress as 
it also addresses a key part of our supply chain--our trucking 
industry. Our nation needs a solution to ensure a stable, reliable 
trucking workforce. The SHIP IT Act modernizes the system by enhancing 
the recruitment and retainment of our trucking workforce by: 
modernizing the authority for certain vehicle waivers during 
emergencies, allowing waivers in response to disease and supply chain 
emergencies; streamlines the Commercial Driver's License process, and 
incentivizes new truck drivers to enter the workforce through targeted 
and temporary tax credits.
    I urge the committee to hold hearings and markups on the above 
bills to ensure a successful, and sustainable supply chain movement for 
our nation.
                          Water Infrastructure
    As you work with the Corps to implement the Water Resources 
Development Act (WRDA) of 2022, please keep in mind a feasibility study 
for modifications to the Redbank and Fancher Creeks project. Modifying 
the project will have the potential to increase groundwater recharge by 
thirty thousand acre-feet during wet years like this one. Recharging 
our depleted groundwater aquifers is badly needed in regions like the 
San Joaquin Valley, and it is critical that we reevaluate operations to 
maximize the potential and efficiency of existing infrastructure we 
already have.
    Looking ahead to the next Water Resources Development Act, I urge 
the Committee to work with the Corps to prioritize efforts to increase 
groundwater recharge in drought-prone areas like my district. I also 
recently learned from state officials that the south San Joaquin Valley 
does not have a regional flood plan. This needs to be rectified, and I 
urge you to work with the Army Corps to coordinate with state and local 
officials as necessary on these efforts.
    Another priority for the Army Corps in my district this year is 
preparing for and responding to the floods we are going to have when 
California's enormous snowpack melts in the coming months. We need to 
be prepared, and we need to restore our infrastructure to be more 
resilient to future wet year floods, and be better prepared to capture 
that floodwater using recharge or other storage methods.
    I urge the committee to work with members to update the Water 
Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program. I am 
preparing to reintroduce my bipartisan bill to clarify that non-federal 
entities who manage federally owned infrastructure are in fact 
qualified applicants. WIFIA could be a critical tool for financing 
repairs to the Jones Pumping Plant that is critical for supplying water 
to tens of millions of people and millions of acres of farmland in 
southern California and the Central Valley. Not having a working Jones 
pumping plan would be akin to deadline of Lake Mead on the Colorado 
River.
                        Sustainable Rail Service
    Rail safety and service are critical as we continue to ensure a 
safe, reliable system for the movement of our people and goods. The 
Federal-State Partnership is a critical program that must fund projects 
that are construction ready and produce high speed rail, such as the 
California High-Speed Rail project. However, it is critical our 
passenger and freight rail are both addressed. As legislation is 
considered on safety, it is imperative the committee consider 
addressing common carrier agreements. Our nation must have both a safe 
and reliable rail system for the movement of goods and people.
         Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization
    As the committee considers the Federal Aviation Administration 
Reauthorization this year, it is critical airports that provide 
regional, domestic, and international service for rural towns are 
prioritized. The Fresno Yosemite International Airport is a critical 
airport for the State of California and for the nation as it plays a 
role in connecting people all over the world to California's crown 
jewel, Yosemite National Park. As the committee considers Federal 
Aviation Administration reauthorization, I urge the committee to 
continue to prioritize airport improvement project funding as it plays 
a critical role in connecting our nation.

    Mr. Edwards. Thank you, Representative Costa.
    Does any Member have any questions of the gentleman from 
California?
    Mr. Cohen. Do you have a position on duck confit?
    Mr. Costa. A position on what?
    Mr. Cohen. Duck confit. Duck confit.
    Mr. Costa. Oh, yes, I do. I think that this is something 
that we should deal with offline, but I am very supportive of 
it.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Edwards. Thank you for that. We will make sure that 
your testimony, too, is included in our record. Thanks for 
being with us this afternoon.
    Next the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida, 
Representative Luna.

   TESTIMONY OF HON. ANNA PAULINA LUNA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
               CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

    Mrs. Luna. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Anna 
Paulina Luna, and I represent Florida's 13th Congressional 
District.
    I wanted to express my priorities regarding the Water 
Resources Development Act, WRDA, and implementation of past 
WRDA provisions.
    My district is home to many pristine beaches. Actually, 
TripAdvisor said we're top 20 in the Nation. So, best beaches 
in the country. And it is my utmost priority to ensure beach 
renourishment continues in my community, which is why I am 
standing before you today.
    The Army Corps of Engineers is delaying the renourishment 
of Sand Key Beach project here in Pinellas County. The initial 
construction effort for Sand Key was completed in 1993, and 
successive renourishments in 1999, 2006, 2012, and 2018 have 
been repaired, and built up the beach significantly with the 
shoreline now about 200 feet from the seawall. Renourishment 
needs to be placed every 6 years, and the next renourishment 
cycle would need to begin in 2024 to stay on schedule and not 
risk beach erosion that would degrade the progress made over 
the last three decades.
    However, before the next renourishment cycle may occur, the 
Army Corps has informed Pinellas County that local officials 
must obtain perpetual public easements along the length of the 
project from 100 percent of property owners, regardless of 
whether or not sand is being placed on their private property 
in the next renourishment cycle.
    For previous renourishments, Pinellas County property 
owners were allowed to use temporary construction easements to 
allow Army Corps to do its work. The Army Corps stated that the 
agency intends to start enforcing this new policy, purportedly 
from 1996, but not enforced for the last two decades. It is a 
flawed requirement to require perpetual public easements on 
private properties that will not have sand placed, and for 
obvious reasons, about half of the private property owners have 
declined to give such easements. Army Corps is now threatening 
to cancel the project entirely.
    Section 103(d) of the 1986 Water Resources Development Act 
requires local sponsors to pay for sand placed on private 
property. Army Corps of Engineers' new interpretation of the 
40-year-old law said that they will not place sand on the 
public side of the beach, which is seaward of the erosion 
control line, unless a perpetual public access easement is 
acquired from the private property owners on the landward side 
of the erosion control line, unless the local sponsor pays 100 
percent of the cost.
    So, basically, Army Corps is going back on their policy. 
They didn't enforce it, and now they are trying to stick our 
people back home with a pricetag on it.
    And I would like to add--I have this script here, but I am 
just going to go off script because you guys just need to hear 
it straight up. We have endangered species. This is going to 
completely impact our area. So much of our local tourism and 
economy focuses on our beaches. And if they don't do this, not 
only are we going to be putting our communities at risk for 
hurricanes and threats, but it is very likely that some of the 
endangered turtles that we have, loggerhead sea turtles, piping 
plover shorebirds, West Indian manatees, eastern black rail, 
red knots, wood storks, American crocodiles, and eastern indigo 
snakes are all going to be at risk because their entire habitat 
is being destroyed.
    So, I am asking for your help. This is my top priority for 
the WRDA 2024 to ensure that the Army Corps proceeds as planned 
with already authorized beach renourishment projects here in 
Florida. While the new Army Corps policies are personal to me 
and my constituents in Pinellas County, I am sure that you will 
hear from many of my colleagues from the Florida delegation 
that they are probably facing similar issues. I respectfully 
request for your assistance in correcting the wayward Army 
Corps of Engineers and ensuring that the Sand Key project goes 
forward as scheduled.
    Thank you, Chairman. I yield my time.
    [Mrs. Luna's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
   Prepared Statement of Hon. Anna Paulina Luna, a Representative in 
                   Congress From the State of Florida
    Hello Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and distinguished 
Members of the Committee. My name is Anna Paulina Luna and I represent 
Florida's 13th Congressional district.
    I wanted to express my priorities regarding Water Resources 
Development Act (WRDA) and implementation of past WRDA provisions. My 
district is home to many pristine beaches along the Gulf of Mexico. It 
is my utmost priority to ensure beach renourishment continues in my 
community. That is why I am before you today.
    The Army Corps of Engineers is delaying the renourishment of the 
Sand Key Beach Project in Pinellas County. The initial construction 
effort for Sand Key was completed in 1993. Successive nourishments in 
1999, 2006, 2012 and 2018 have repaired and built up the beach 
significantly with the shoreline now about 200 feet from the seawall. 
Renourishment needs to be placed every six years. The next 
renourishment cycle would need to begin in 2024 to stay on schedule and 
not risk beach erosion that would degrade the progress made over the 
last three decades.
    However, before the next renourishment may occur, the Army Corps 
has informed Pinellas County that local officials must obtain perpetual 
public access easements along the length of the project from 100 
percent of property owners regardless of whether sand is being placed 
on their private property in the next renourishment cycle. For previous 
nourishments, Pinellas County property owners were allowed to use 
temporary construction easements to allow the Army Corps to do its 
work. Army Corps stated that the agency intends to start enforcing this 
new policy, purportedly from 1996 but not enforced for the past two 
decades. It is a flawed requirement to require perpetual public 
easements on private properties that will not have sand placed, and for 
obvious reasons about half of private property owners have declined to 
give such an easement. Army Corps is now threatening to cancel the 
project entirely.
    Section 103(d) 1986 Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) requires 
the local sponsor to pay for sand placed on private property. Army 
Corps of Engineers new interpretation of this 40-year-old law is that 
they will not place sand on the public side of beach, which is seaward 
of the erosion control line, unless a perpetual public access easement 
is acquired from the private property owners on the landward side of 
the erosion control line unless the local sponsor pays 100% of the 
cost. Army Corps ridiculously maintains this position even when sand is 
not being placed in front of the private property. The law never 
specified that easements would be needed for private properties where 
sand was NOT being placed and/or the project was not affecting those 
areas yet the Army Corps of Engineers points to this law as its 
justification for not moving forward with the project. This is a power 
grab attempt to strip property rights from homeowners where easements 
are not needed to complete the next renourishment cycle. The Army Corps 
of Engineers stated it requires these perpetual easements for ``for 
access and future responses''. It is apparent that Army Corps of 
Engineers is stretching its interpretation of the law with no legal or 
statutory authority to do so.
    We must rein in the Army Corps of Engineers and direct the agency 
in WRDA that perpetual public easements are not required for private 
properties who are not receiving sand during the renourishment cycle. 
The absence of public easements in perpetuity for private properties 
must not be a consideration for the Army Corps of Engineers to delay or 
not perform the project. We need to reiterate to them that publicly 
owned land seaward of the state's erosion control line is considered 
publicly accessible shore for purposes of federal cost sharing for 
periodic nourishment.
    Without renourishment, Pinellas County will be more prone to future 
hurricanes and flood damage, which will negatively impact the entire 
county's economy. Without this scheduled 2024 nourishment, the beach 
will dissipate and erode, demolishing many habitats to endangered 
species and threatened wildlife. Specifically, Loggerhead Sea Turtles, 
Piping Plover Shorebird, West Indian Manatee, Eastern Black Rail, Red 
Knot, Wood Stork, American Crocodile, Eastern Indigo Snake, Green Sea 
Turtle, Hawksbill Sea Turtle, and the Leatherback Sea Turtle are 
federally classified as endangered or threatened species and reside in 
and/or around the Sand Key region. Without renourishment to preserve 
the habitats of our endangered species, they will be placed at greater 
risk. The Army Corps is under an obligation to exercise its authority 
to further the conservation of endangered and threatened species. In 
this case, Army Corps action that reimagines the 1986 WRDA statute will 
devastate such species.
    It is my top priority for WRDA 2024 to ensure that Army Corps 
proceeds as planned with already authorized beach renourishment 
projects in Florida. While this new Army Corps policy is very personal 
to me and my constituents in Pinellas County, I'm sure you will hear 
from my colleagues that this new policy is threatening many other 
projects throughout Florida. I respectfully request your assistance in 
correcting the wayward Army Corps of Engineers and ensure that the Sand 
Key Beach Project goes forward on schedule.
    Thank you.

    Mr. Ezell [presiding]. Thank you, Representative Luna.
    Does anybody have any questions of Representative Luna?
    With that, we will put your testimony in the record.
    Mrs. Luna. Thank you.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
    All right. Now the gentleman from Illinois, Representative 
Danny Davis.

TESTIMONY OF HON. DANNY K. DAVIS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

    Mr. Davis of Illinois. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking 
Member, and members of the committee.
    As Congress considers the FAA reauthorization, I 
respectfully ask your leadership in addressing the racial and 
ethnic disparities in aviation. Being an aircraft pilot is an 
in-demand, high-paying profession with the median annual wage 
for a commercial pilot being over $134,000 a year. 
Unfortunately, the aviation industry is impressively 
homogeneous. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 95.7 
percent of aviation pilots and engineers in 2022 were White, 
with only 9.7 percent being Hispanic/Latino, 2.6 percent being 
Black, and 1.6 percent being Asian. Approximately 90.8 percent 
of aviation pilots and engineers are men.
    Congress has an opportunity to help individuals enter 
aviation careers while increasing the diversity of the field. 
The high cost of training is a key barrier to entering the 
profession, especially for people of color. Pilot training can 
cost between $80,000 to $100,000 a year. Substantial Federal 
investment is required to help address the immediate need to 
increase the aviation workforce, with the focus on individuals 
currently underrepresented in the profession.
    The Aviation Workforce Development Grants program invests 
in training and diversification of aircraft pilots and aviation 
maintenance workers. In fiscal year 2023, the aircraft pilot 
program and the aviation maintenance program received only $5 
million and $10 million, respectively. Support in the House for 
these programs was evident last year, when my amendment to 
increase funding for these grants passed during floor 
consideration of the transportation appropriations bill.
    Further, I ask that the committee improve pilot diversity 
by including language to expand partnerships with Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and 
Universities, and the five Minority-Serving Institutions, 
including Predominantly Black Institutions; Asian American, 
Native American, and Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions; 
Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions; 
Hispanic-Serving Institutions; and Native American-Serving Non-
Tribal Institutions.
    These institutions have experience in educating and 
graduating low-income students of color. Indeed, such 
partnerships have helped diversify many important fields, 
including defense, science, and technology. Collaborating with 
these institutions is an effective way for aviation policy to 
target grants to students from racial/ethnic backgrounds with 
financial need.
    In closing, I want to recognize my friend and colleague, 
Representative Hank Johnson from Georgia, for his leadership on 
diversifying aviation education.
    I urge my colleagues to use your leadership on aviation 
policy to help individuals enter aviation careers while 
increasing the diversity of the field.
    Thank you very much, and I yield back.

    Mr. Soto. Thank you, Chairman and Ranking Member, for this 
opportunity. I know it is a long and arduous hearing, but we 
appreciate you being generous with your time and patience, 
knowing after passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, our 
Nation and this committee has a huge responsibility that 
affects all Members. So, I appreciate the opportunity.
    We in central Florida are home to Orlando International 
Airport, where we expect to host about 1.7 million passengers 
per week by the end of 2023. People are traveling again. And 
timely reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration 
reauthorization bill, the FAA reauthorization, is incredibly 
important to ensure a safe and efficient travel experience, a 
robust travel experience and opportunities for all Americans.
    My priorities in the 2023 FAA reauthorization include 
several points.
    Now first, increased funding and flexibility of funds for 
the Airport Improvement Program. We see a lot of these being 
deployed right now. But as new projects come up, being allowed 
to have AIP eligibility for all activities allowed under the 
passenger fare charge program, the PFC, as outlined in the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, along with FAA 
requirements that mandate programmatic funding priorities take 
that new eligibility into account. We need this flexibility for 
our airports and the increased authorized funding for AIP to a 
minimum of $4 billion annually.
    Second, addressing aviation industry workforce shortages. I 
support steps to address such as increasing Federal student 
loan aid for pilot training, extending and increasing funding 
for Aviation Workforce Development Grants to $10 million 
annually, and continued support for programs such as the FAA's 
Minority Serving Institutions Internship Program, which 
promotes diversity in the aviation workforce.
    Additionally, I support efforts to provide aviation student 
housing on airport properties. I recently was in our smaller 
municipal airport in Kissimmee, and they are not only focusing 
on executive travel, having Orlando International Airport just 
a few miles away, but also in training new pilots and new 
mechanics. Right now, student housing is not considered 
compatible with our local airports. By having this on Kissimmee 
Airport and other airports across the Nation, this will help us 
in allowing pilots to stay close to these training facilities, 
and help with this pilot shortage we have heard from a lot of 
folks today.
    Also, it is critical that we have airspace integration 
between space launch and reentry. I support authorization of no 
less than $10 million in the fiscal year 2024 through 2028 to 
expedite development, acquisition, and deployment of 
technologies that help with this. In central Florida, we had 53 
flights last year, space flights. This year, we will have 83 
launching from Cape Canaveral. So, as we are working on 
ensuring America's space leadership, coordinating with airports 
is going to be absolutely critical going forward.
    In addition, it is key to improve the customer experience 
for the hearing impaired. We want to make sure our seniors, our 
folks with disabilities, have equal access. And so, we support 
the air travel needs of passengers with disabilities 
established in section 439 of the 2018 FAA reauthorization.
    In addition, we support the requirement of the committee to 
submit in its annual report to Congress a list of policy 
recommendations for how Congress, the Department of 
Transportation, and airlines can help those who need closed 
captions to get through the airport and to their destination.
    In addition, improving customer experience with regard to 
the use of airline vouchers, having clear printed policies and 
using conspicuous verbiage and language for blackout dates and 
expiration dates of vouchers are key. As you can appreciate, 
over the holiday season, a lot of folks had some flights that 
they missed. And knowing how they can get back on track and 
take that family vacation to Orlando or other destinations 
across the United States and abroad is very key to make sure 
people know how those vouchers work.
    Also, priority to authorizing funding for Federal contract 
air traffic control towers, for the aircraft rescue and fire 
fighting truck program, for the taxiway delta extension 
program, unmanned aerial systems, and the transitional plan for 
PFAS remediation. We have got a lot going on in Orlando with 
airports, so, this is a huge part for our district.
    So, I just thank you for the time, gentlemen, both of you, 
and thank you to your staff for giving us the opportunity 
today.
    [Mr. Soto's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Darren Soto, a Representative in Congress 
                       From the State of Florida
    Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, thank you for allowing me 
to testify before the Committee about my priorities for the Committee's 
work in 2023.
    First, I appreciate the opportunity to present my priorities for 
the upcoming Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization 
Bill. My district is home to the Orlando International Airport, which 
currently expects traffic to grow to 1.7 million passengers per week by 
the end of 2023. The timely reauthorization of this Bill is incredibly 
important given the role the FAA plays in ensuring a safe and efficient 
travel experience for these passengers. My priorities for the 2023 FAA 
Reauthorization include:
      Increased funding and flexibility of funds for the 
Airport Improvement Program (AIP). I support extending AIP eligibility 
to all activities allowed under the Passenger Fare Charge (PFC) program 
as outlined in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Pub.L. 117-
58), along with FAA requirements that mandate programmatic funding 
priorities take the new eligibility into account. This will ensure 
airports have maximum flexibility to improve infrastructure and 
capacity. In addition, I support increasing the authorized funding 
levels for AIP to a minimum of $4 billion annually.

      Addressing the aviation industry workforce shortage. I 
support steps to address the aviation workforce shortage, such as: 1) 
increasing federal student loan aid for pilot training, 2) extending 
and increasing funding for Aviation Workforce Development Grants to $10 
million annually, and; 3) continued support for programs such as the 
FAA's Minority Serving Institutions Intern Program (MSI), which 
promotes diversity in the aviation workforce. Additionally, I support 
efforts to provide aviation student housing on airport property. 
Currently, the FAA views student housing on airports as non-compatible 
land use, however, additional support for students is necessary given 
the current shortage of pilots and mechanics. This initiative would 
support training efforts for students, especially students from 
historically underrepresented communities, by lowering expenses of 
housing and travel costs to and from the airport and developing an 
affordable campus atmosphere.

      Airspace integration for space launch and reentry. I 
support requirements for the FAA to prioritize the development and 
deployment of technologies to improve the visibility of space launch 
and reentry operations within FAA computer systems and minimize 
operational workload to air traffic controllers associated with routing 
traffic during spaceflight launch and reentry operations. Additionally, 
I support the authorization of no less than $10 million for fiscal 
years 2024 through 2028 to expedite the development, acquisition, and 
deployment of technologies or capabilities to aid in space launch and 
reentry integration. These efforts will help minimize launch delays and 
help relieve burden from both airlines and commercial space flight 
providers.

      Improving customer experience for the hearing impaired. I 
support the renewal of an Advisory Committee on issues related to the 
air travel needs of passengers with disabilities, originally 
established in SEC. 439 of the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Bill. In 
addition, I support a requirement for the committee to submit in its 
annual report to Congress a list of policy recommendations for how 
Congress, the Department of Transportation, and airlines can 
collaborate to accelerate the adoption of in-flight entertainment 
systems capable of closed captions to improve the experience of 
passengers who are hearing impaired.

      Improving customer experience with regard to the use of 
airline vouchers. I support a requirement for airlines to print clear 
and conspicuous blackout and expiration dates on vouchers issued to 
customers for redemption of flights or other services.

      Funding for the Federal Contract Air Traffic Control 
Tower program. I support the authorization of $16 million for this 
program, as it will improve efficiency for increased air traffic levels 
and serve as a critical safety measure to maintain separation of 
aircrafts.

      Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) Truck program. I 
support the authorization of $1 million for this program, as it will 
protect against economic losses from fire, create additional jobs, and 
serve as a critical asset to regional economies and transportation 
systems.

      Taxiway Delta Extension program. I support the 
authorization of $12 million for this program to improve aging 
infrastructure and expand airport operations to meet today's required 
aviation growth.

      Promoting safety regarding Unmanned Ariel Systems (UAS). 
I support requirements for the FAA to work with airports, aviation 
stakeholders, and TSA to ensure (1) new entrants are safely integrated 
into the National Airspace System, and (2) airports are protected from 
unsafe UAS activities.

      Transitional plan for PFAS remediation. I support FAA 
collaboration with industry stakeholders to develop a national 
transition plan that would assist airports in moving to fluorine-free 
firefighting foams. Specifically, I support the allocation of federal 
funds for an acquisition program for the new foam, a disposal program 
for the old foam, and PFAS remediation at airports. In addition, I 
support liability protection to airports around previous use of PFAS, 
including CERCLA liability protection.

    I would also like to ask the Committee to prioritize continued 
oversight of the following projects authorized through the 2022 Water 
Resource Development Act:
      The Lake Runnymede, Florida project for ecosystem 
restoration.
      The Lake Tohopekaliga, Florida Project for ecosystem 
restoration and flood risk management.
      The Shingle Creek and Kissimmee River project for 
ecosystem restoration and flood risk management.
      The $10 million authorization for wastewater 
infrastructure, including stormwater management, in Polk County, 
Florida.
      The $50 million authorization for water and wastewater 
infrastructure, including water reclamation and water supply, in Orange 
County, Florida.

    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Larsen, I look forward to working with 
you to advance these priorities and I welcome any questions you may 
have. Thank you and I yield back.

    Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Representative Soto.
    Does anyone have any questions?
    Mr. Cohen. I've got one. Cape Canaveral or Cape Kennedy?
    Mr. Soto. So, Cape Kennedy is a part of Cape Canaveral. So, 
both coexist. But we have the Kennedy Space Center. So, 
President Kennedy's great legacy is still enshrined to this 
day, just like President Johnson. And space has always been a 
bipartisan thing. We want to keep it that way.
    We saw our last couple of Presidents really invest in 
getting forward, and I am proud to say, gentlemen, that we are 
now regularly launching from America's soil again, and have 
been for about 2 or 3 years now. I know that is critical to 
everyone. And your committee plays a key role.
    Mr. Cohen. You could put Elon Musk in one of those things 
and just send him into deep space.
    Mr. Soto. We appreciate the role of the commercial sector, 
and I can tell you, whether it is SpaceX, Blue Origin, ULA, or 
the many other commercial space companies that are operating at 
Cape Canaveral, they are all important parts of it, in addition 
to NASA and my constituent, Administrator Nelson, as well.
    So, we will focus on the productive here today, 
Representative Cohen. I think that will get us a long way.
    Thank you. I appreciate the time, gentlemen.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Representative Soto. Your testimony 
will be included in the record.
    The committee will now recess, subject to the chair.
    [Recess.]
    Mr. Ezell. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee 
will now reconvene. I now recognize the gentleman from New 
York, Representative Goldman, for 5 minutes.

   TESTIMONY OF HON. DANIEL S. GOLDMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK

    Mr. Goldman of New York. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and 
Ranking Member Larsen, for inviting me to testify before the 
committee today on the transportation and infrastructure issues 
that are particularly important to my district, New York 10, 
which covers lower Manhattan and a large part of northwest 
Brooklyn.
    As you know, New York City is the most densely populated 
city in the country. Our public transportation system and our 
transit infrastructure are the busiest in the Nation, and are 
under immense stress. The historic passage of the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation 
Reduction Act last Congress provided us the opportunity to 
begin to address some of the most pressing issues in my 
district. But our work is far from over.
    As you work to reauthorize transportation and 
infrastructure programs this Congress, I would like to call to 
your attention a few of my district's priorities.
    First, we must make sure that our most marginalized 
communities are not left behind by the renovation of the 
Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. The BQE is one of the most traveled 
highways in New York State, and is a notoriously disruptive 
corridor in my district. The communities surrounding the 
highway have been unjustly segregated by its physical 
infrastructure since the 1950s, when it was designed to spare 
wealthier neighborhoods from disturbance.
    Perpetuating inequities even further, the overwhelming 
pollution and heavy traffic that the highway produces have 
disproportionately affected these already vulnerable 
communities, exposing them to toxic fumes, dangerous pedestrian 
conditions, and contributing to higher rates of asthma than 
normal.
    Ensuring that Federal dollars go to protecting the health 
and environment of the surrounding communities while the 
dilapidated central portion of the BQE undergoes construction 
is a top priority of mine. This is an environmental justice 
issue, and I ask that the committee continue to support and 
oversee programs such as the newly created Reconnecting 
Communities grant program, as well as INFRA and Mega grants to 
support all communities, including those in my district that 
historically have been overlooked.
    Second, I am asking the committee to prioritize rigorous 
oversight of the EPA's massively important State revolving 
funds, which received $50 billion in funding through the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The goal of the Clean Water and 
Drinking Water State Revolving Funds is to upgrade and 
strengthen our national water and stormwater systems so no 
American is exposed to unsafe drinking water, and our 
communities have the resources they need to protect themselves 
from increasingly severe flooding and extreme weather 
conditions.
    Unfortunately, these investments have not always been 
equitably distributed, predominantly excluding communities of 
color where continued dismissal of their needs has compounded, 
leaving them with aging, outdated, and hazardous water systems. 
A recent report by the National Resources Defense Council found 
that municipalities with larger White populations were more 
likely to receive support from the Clean Water State Revolving 
Funds than others. My district includes communities that suffer 
from this inequity.
    Further still, a number of these marginalized neighborhoods 
are on low-lying topography, and they desperately need Federal 
funds to help mitigate inland flooding and increase capacity 
for safe and effective stormwater management.
    In order to ensure that Federal investments and State 
revolving funds through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
benefit all Americans, the committee must oversee the fair 
distribution of the funds by States with rigorous oversight and 
accountability.
    Finally, I strongly urge the committee to advance a bill I 
have cosponsored, the Safe and Quiet Skies Act, as you go 
through the reauthorization of the FAA process this year. The 
legislation would restrict commercial air tours and 
nonessential helicopter flights, protecting our communities and 
sparing them the constant and severe disruption that they cause 
through both noise and air pollution.
    The density of my community makes the threat of a localized 
helicopter or small aircraft crash very dangerous. Since 1983, 
we have had at least 30 helicopter crashes in our region, with 
at least 25 fatalities, according to the NTSB records. These 
nonessential flights catering to tourists have continued to 
grow. In the last 5 years, noise complaints have gone up in New 
York City by more than 2,300 percent.
    In addition to noise and severe vibrations, the excessive 
use of fossil fuels by helicopters further harms our 
environment. It is imperative that these operations be much 
more tightly regulated for the health, safety, and quality of 
life in our communities.
    Thank you again, Chairman, for your time and consideration 
today.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. KATIE PORTER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                  FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Ms. Porter. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today.
    The reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration 
sure is bringing a lot of Members with their hands out, but 
with good reason. We should all want better for airline 
passengers, whether that is somebody making a trip across the 
country for a funeral or to pitch a new business.
    But year after year, people who step on an airplane are not 
having a good time, and sometimes not even getting to their 
destinations. Some were victims of ``Honey, I shrunk the 
airplane seat.'' Some had their flights canceled or 
significantly delayed, often due to meltdowns caused by 
airlines' underinvestment in technology and tools. With the 
flightmares that people endure, we can't let a good 
reauthorization go to waste. Let's get this right, Democrat or 
Republican. This stuff gets on everyone's nerves.
    Let's start with an easy one. What is 72 inches tall, but 
fits in a 31-inch space? A miserable passenger struggling to 
sit in the airplane seat they paid hundreds of dollars for. The 
FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 required the FAA to establish 
minimum dimensions for passenger seats. It hasn't happened. The 
law passed almost 5 years ago, and since the FAA has not acted, 
now we must.
    Is anyone here against telling the airlines not to shrink 
their seats any further until the FAA acts?
    Good. Then let's advance my Stop Airplane Seat Shrinking 
Act to require the FAA to prevent seat size reductions until 
they have done their rulemaking.
    Now, how about the FAA issues some minimum requirements for 
airlines to maintain safe and workable flight planning systems?
    Last December, because of outdated software, Southwest 
Airlines canceled more than 16,700 flights and stranded 
thousands. Today, the exact same thing happened. I would like 
permission to enter into the record this headline published 
today, Tuesday, April 18th: ``Southwest Airlines delayed more 
than 1,500 flights. Southwest had a meltdown over its 
technology problems.''
    Let's advance my Flightmare Prevention Act because we need 
to do something about Southwest's scheduling system that is 
straight out of the 1990s and their failure to invest to 
upgrade it. The Flightmare Prevention Act would require the FAA 
to issue minimum requirements for airlines' enterprise resource 
planning systems.
    Now, to be clear, it is not just technology, though, that 
is tripping up our aviation system. It is also staffing.
    My home airport, Orange County, cannot get the air traffic 
controllers that it needs. Why? Because the FAA restricts where 
they can get available staff.
    Right now, Orange County's airport is considered level 8, 
based on its volumes of arrivals and departures. Unlike smaller 
airports classified from 4 to 7, it cannot pull cadets from the 
FAA Air Traffic Control Academy and the National Employee 
Service, NES, transfers. And unlike larger airports classified 
from 9 to 12, it cannot offer comparably higher pay. We 
shouldn't be catching airports like mine between a rock and a 
hard place. The FAA needs to make level 8 airports eligible for 
the air traffic controllers that they need. It is simple. If we 
have air traffic controllers, we can move planes, and our 
aviation system functions more smoothly for passengers.
    We have talked a lot about the things that we can do to 
prevent flightmares. But even with improvements, severe delays 
and cancellations can happen. What do airlines owe passengers 
when they don't actually deliver them to their destinations?
    To start, 6 of the 10 major airlines have already pledged 
to reschedule their passengers on another airline when there is 
a controllable, significant delay or cancellation. Plus, the 
FAA already has guidance to require refunds for passengers who 
do not fly after a significant delay or cancellation. I say 
let's combine these ideas. My Choices for Stranded Travelers 
Act would require airlines with controllable, significant 
delays and cancellations to get their passengers faster, 
alternative transportation or, if the passenger chooses, they 
can still get that full cash refund.
    Now, even if we advance all of the solutions I have talked 
about, implementing them requires a strong FAA. So, the last 
request I have today is to pass my FAA Engagement and 
Transparency Act, which will require the FAA to appear annually 
before this committee to answer Congress Members' questions and 
talk about the work it is doing to engage the public.
    I respectfully request that the committee include the 
solutions I have proposed today in its reauthorization. Let's 
stop flightmares, and let's make our aviation system work 
better for the people we serve.
    I yield back.
    [Ms. Porter's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Katie Porter, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of California
    I write to respectfully provide my priorities for the Federal 
Aviation Administration Reauthorization of 2023. I appreciate your 
consideration of the following priorities:
1. Air Traffic Control Facilities--ATC Level 8 Recruitment
    I request that ATC facilities given Level 8 rankings be able to 
recruit cadets from the FAA Air Traffic Control Academy (``The 
Academy''), just as Level 4-7 facilities. As it stands, Level 8 
facilities are unable to pull cadets unless they are given Level 4-7 
facility rankings from the FAA. This forces unnecessary burden on Level 
8 facilities that must rely on the National Centralized EER Placement 
Process (``NCEPT''), or voluntary controller relocation requests which 
not only forces ATCs to wait on release dates, but also training times 
before a controller can be ready to operate. This limited pool has 
prevented Level 8 facilities from being able to advance to Level 9 
during National Validation Team (``NVT'') upgrade inspections as they 
are forced to reduce services given the lack of available resources. 
The FAA needs to make Level 8 airports eligible for the air traffic 
controllers they need so our aviation system functions more smoothly.
2. Minimum Requirements for Aviation Enterprise Resource Management 
        Systems
    I request that my bill, the Flightmare Prevention Act of 2023, be 
considered for inclusion in the final FAA Reauthorization package. This 
bill would require the FAA Administrator to issue regulations that 
establish minimum requirements for aviation enterprise resource 
planning systems. Currently, major air carriers can simply choose 
whether to update aviation enterprise resource planning systems, which 
control crew and flight scheduling. Unfortunately, outdated systems 
have led to mass cancellations and stranded passengers hundreds of 
miles away from their destination without any compensation. This has a 
significant effect on the safety and quality of air travel, and minimum 
enterprise resource planning system requirements are needed to prevent 
this.
3. Passenger Rights During Controllable Significant Air Travel 
        Disruptions
    I request that my bill, the Choices for Stranded Passengers Act of 
2023, be considered for inclusion in the final FAA Reauthorization 
package. This bill would require air carriers to provide passengers 
experiencing a controllable significant delay or cancellation with an 
alternative flight, including on another air carrier if necessary. This 
simply builds on commitments that the Department of Transportation 
(DOT) already has from six of the ten largest airlines to provide 
alternative transportation in the event of cancellations or delays at 
no additional cost. Further, the bill codifies the existing requirement 
for airlines to provide a full cash refund if the passenger chooses not 
to travel after experiencing such a delay or cancellation. This bill 
will make sure all passengers are made whole when their plans are 
impacted by a controllable disruption to their air travel.
4. Airline Passenger Seat Size
    I am requesting that my bill, Stop Airplane Seat Shrinking Act, be 
included in the final FAA Reauthorization package. This would require 
the FAA Administrator to prohibit air carriers from reducing the size 
of passenger seats on air carriers until the Administrator issues a 
final rule establishing minimum dimensions for passenger seats, as 
required under section 577 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (PL 
115-254). According to recent reporting, airlines are ``balancing 
passenger demand for cheap airfare and more legroom.'' The size of a 
passenger seat is necessary for safety, especially during an aircraft 
evacuation. Additionally, taller passengers shouldn't have to pay extra 
to sit in seats that accommodate larger legroom. This bill is an 
important stopgap to stop further seat shrinking until final rules take 
effect.
5. FAA Engagement and Transparency
    I am requesting that my bill, the Federal Aviation Administration 
Engagement and Transparency Act, be included in the final FAA 
Reauthorization package. The bill requires the Comptroller General of 
the United States to conduct a study on the response time of the FAA 
Administrator in regards to congressional inquiries and requests. It 
also requires the FAA Administrator to annually brief Congress on the 
agency's efforts activities, objectives, plans, and efforts to engage 
with Congress and the public. This bill will ensure that the FAA is 
effective and transparent, especially as it implements the 
reauthorization.

    Thank you for your consideration of these requests. Should you have 
any questions, please contact my Legislative Assistant/Natural 
Resources Advisor, Natalie Marek.

    Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
    Does anybody have any questions of Representative Porter?

TESTIMONY OF HON. JASON CROW, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM 
                     THE STATE OF COLORADO

    Mr. Crow. Thank you, Chairman and members of the 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. We appreciate you 
holding this forum for me and other Members to share with the 
committee our views and concerns regarding the reauthorization 
of the Federal Aviation Administration.
    I proudly represent Colorado's Sixth Congressional 
District, and I am one of several Members of Congress who are a 
part of the Quiet Skies Caucus. My district is home to 
Centennial Airport, which is the Nation's second busiest 
general aviation airport.
    The FAA has been entrusted with ensuring aviation safety, 
which is a serious concern for residents in my district who 
live below the flightpath. In fact, we had a mid-air collision 
near Centennial Airport in 2021. Community members remain 
deeply concerned about subsequent changes at the airport and 
any future accident that could endanger both those in the air 
and on the ground.
    Many of my constituents have serious concerns about the 
impact that concentrated flights also have on their homes, 
their children, our community, and our health. To start, 
residents are concerned about health risks, particularly to 
children and pregnant women, from exposure to high levels of 
lead from aviation fuel emissions.
    Additionally, residents are pained by the frequent high-
decibel noise from planes overheard that disrupt their homes, 
schools, and parks. Residents' mental health and way of life 
are being impacted. On multiple occasions since 2022, 
constituents have expressed to my staff that the constant 
disruption is intolerable and make their homes feel virtually 
unlivable. Far too often, the FAA and others have dismissed 
these concerns and not given them their full attention.
    The FAA needs to be more responsive to community concerns 
in concert with local officials, and I ask the committee to 
seriously consider new mandates.
    At the Centennial Airport, a noise roundtable has been 
established, and a noise abatement guide exists. Local public 
officials, the Arapahoe County Public Airport Authority, and 
residents are working with the FAA. However, the FAA has not 
always attended their meetings, and we should require a better 
response from them to address all of our community's concerns.
    Recently, Chair of the Arapahoe County Board of 
Commissioners Warren-Gully, Greenwood Village Mayor Lantz, 
Arapahoe County Public Airport Authority Chair Bagnato, and 
Centennial Airport Noise Roundtable Chair Peirce requested 
greater local control to address aircraft noise issues. They 
have specifically requested that the FAA be required to take 
both safety and noise abatement into account when working in 
concert with local airports and communities.
    In addition, they are seeking the assignment of FAA 
technical experts to the newly created Sub-Roundtable Technical 
Working Group and regular participation with community groups, 
the Centennial Airport Community Noise Roundtable, and the 
airport to address aviation issues.
    They have further requested the creation of new financial 
incentives to accelerate the production and distribution of 
alternative unleaded fuels.
    As you proceed with the reauthorization of the FAA, we 
implore you that any new legislation address the concerns of 
communities on the ground, who endure the consequences of 
inaction every day. There must be stronger requirements to 
address the noise, environmental health, and safety issues 
impacting those underneath flightpaths.
    Additionally, I request that the committee include 
meaningful requirements that will accelerate the transition 
away from leaded aviation fuel to safer, more environmentally 
conscious alternatives. I and members of the Congressional 
Quiet Skies Caucus have repeatedly made requests for changes at 
the FAA, and it is time for the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee to make meaningful changes to the 
FAA's authorizing statute that require greater protection for 
the health and safety of families in my district and around the 
country, and require them to engage with our local communities 
and local leaders.
    I thank you for the opportunity to talk to you today, and I 
yield back.

TESTIMONY OF HON. MARIE GLUESENKAMP PEREZ, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
             CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Ms. Perez. Thank you, Chairman Graves and Ranking Member 
Larsen, for the opportunity to testify today.
    My district in southwest Washington has some infrastructure 
needs that are common to many districts, like repairing water 
systems, fixing our roads, and improving our freight railroads. 
But my district also has some unique needs I would like to 
address today.
    First and foremost, my district is home to one of the 
largest, most complex, and most nationally important bridge 
replacement projects in the country. The I-5 bridge over the 
Columbia River actually just celebrated its 107th birthday on 
Valentine's Day. That is a lot of candles on a cake. This 
bridge is a critical stretch of I-5, and it has been rated 
functionally obsolete by the Department of Transportation. 
Congestion clogs the bridge for as many as 10 hours a day, and 
it is highly vulnerable to an earthquake.
    Someone once described--actually, our mayor in Vancouver 
regularly describes it as a bridge that was built on pretzel 
sticks driven into chocolate pudding.
    In January, Ranking Member Larsen got the chance to meet 
with the bridge replacement team firsthand to better understand 
why replacing the bridge is so critical. The Interstate Bridge 
Replacement program, or the IBR, is necessary to reduce 
congestion and meet travel demand, address significant 
earthquake vulnerability, improve safety, increase freight 
movement and efficiency, create safe paths for bicycles and 
pedestrians, and expand transportation opportunities.
    This project is big, and it cannot happen without Federal 
help. So, I appreciate the committee's ongoing support for key 
surface transportation and transit programs. Federal programs 
created or bolstered the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will be 
critical to the project's success, including the Bridge 
Investment Program, Capital Investment Grant Program, and the 
Mega grant program.
    Just last month, I led a bipartisan letter to the 
Appropriations Committee requesting full funding for the Bridge 
Investment Program. I want to make sure the committee knows how 
critical this project is to my district, to the Northwest, and 
to the Nation.
    Next, I would like to discuss the importance of port and 
waterway programs. As both the chairman and the ranking member 
know, our country's ports and working waterways are critical 
infrastructure. Nearly 40 percent of the jobs in my home State 
of Washington are tied to international trade. We are the most 
trade-dependent State in the most trade-dependent region in the 
country.
    Not too long ago, Ranking Member Larsen and I met at the 
Port of Kalama, where we heard straight from the source about 
the key infrastructure needs that some of our ports share, like 
investments in turning basins and dredging. What I hear time 
and time again is that they need Federal programs that meet 
their needs and have funding to back it up. I am supportive of 
doing anything we can to expand port programs like the PIDP, 
the Small Shipyard Grant Program, the Marine Highway Program.
    I also support expanding multimodal grant and loan programs 
like RAISE, INFRA, and TIFIA to work better for our ports.
    And it isn't just physical infrastructure that needs more 
investment. Our workforce does, as well. The maritime workforce 
has dealt with many of the same issues that other sectors face, 
and the Federal Government's antiquated systems have hindered 
efforts. We must start modernizing existing maritime workforce 
programs, and we need to ensure new workforce programs are 
working the way they should, like they have in much of 
southwest Washington.
    I have been so proud to see MARAD select PAC Maritime as a 
Center for Excellence for domestic maritime workforce training 
and education. Their Vancouver program at Clark College is 
working on the ground to ensure this region can meet the 
maritime needs workforce of the future.
    And briefly, I want to voice my support for the Army Corps' 
many roles in maintaining our navigable waterways. From 
dredging to operating the hydropower dams of the Columbia 
River, the Corps is a key partner in our region.
    My district is also home to Mount St. Helens.
    The Corps' long-term work protecting Cowlitz County through 
flood protection, sediment monitoring, and sediment management 
is vital to protect rivers, fish habitats, and communities.
    And before I move on, I also want to note my ongoing 
support for the Jones Act. Protecting American workers and 
shipyards is crucial for both economic and national security.
    Last, I would like to discuss a few priorities of mine that 
are relevant to the ongoing FAA reauthorization process.
    First, I strongly support the efforts to bolster workforce 
development programs through reauthorization. I am in support 
of the efforts led by Ranking Member Larsen to expand the 
Aviation Workforce Development Grants programs to cover more 
aviation professions and increase funding for grants.
    I also support the efforts to expand the Airport 
Improvement Program so that airports can use funds for 
resiliency. As I touched on before, the Northwest has unique 
seismic vulnerabilities.
    I want to thank Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen 
once again for giving me the opportunity to testify. I look 
forward to working with you both to deliver for communities in 
southwest Washington. Thank you.

    When the big one hits--and it's only a matter of time--our airports 
need to be up and running so that federal aid can come in quickly--it's 
a matter of life or death for my constituents.
    I want to thank Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen once 
again for giving me the opportunity to testify today, and I look 
forward to working with both of you to deliver for communities in 
Southwest Washington.

    Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
    Does anyone have any questions?
    No questions. Then your testimony will be added to the 
record. I now recognize the gentleman from Pennsylvania, 
Representative Fitzpatrick, for 5 minutes.

  TESTIMONY OF HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
         CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA

    Mr. Fitzpatrick. I thank the chairman and the ranking 
member for having us here today.
    And as you begin the difficult task of authoring the FAA 
Reauthorization Act this year, I strongly urge this committee, 
which I formerly served on, to prioritize the safety and well-
being of the American people, both in the skies and on the 
ground.
    Last July, as a member of this committee, I raised the 
issue of secondary cockpit barriers to Secretary Buttigieg, and 
I shared the story of my constituent, Captain Victor Saracini. 
As many of you know, Captain Saracini's aircraft, which he 
piloted, United flight 175, was hijacked on September 11th of 
2001, and flown into the World Trade Center. It was the second 
airplane that the entire world watched in horror.
    After any tragedy, all of our first question is always: 
What could we have done differently to prevent this from 
happening? While there are many answers in this case, secondary 
cockpit barriers are certainly one of the best answers. Despite 
being included among the recommendations issued nearly two 
decades ago by the 9/11 Commission, and as a requirement for 
new aircraft in the last FAA reauthorization bill over 4 years 
ago, few commercial planes have secondary barriers, and the 
flight deck remains vulnerable. This is several decades after 
9/11.
    We must keep our commitment to say ``never again,'' 
preventing terrorists from infiltrating the cockpit and using 
commercial airliners like a guided missile. I urge the 
committee to exercise oversight over the Department of 
Transportation in this case, as I am, and call on Secretary 
Buttigieg to issue the final rule that was due back in 2019.
    Moreover, as you consider this year's FAA reauthorization, 
I urge you to include H.R. 911, the Saracini Enhanced Aviation 
Safety Act. This is a bipartisan bill which I introduced in 
February, along with Representatives Carson, Gottheimer, Kean, 
Lynch, and Smith, a bipartisan bill across the board. It would 
extend the implementation of this low-cost security measure to 
all commercial aircraft in the United States.
    The security of the flight deck is essential to the safety 
of our pilots, flightcrews, passengers, and their families, and 
I thank you for consideration of that.
    And as cochair of the Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus, I 
would also like to encourage the committee to continue to 
improve airport and aircraft accessibility. While some progress 
has been made, when I speak to my constituents that have rare 
diseases and disabilities, much more work needs to be done to 
ensure that the boarding, in-flight, and deplaning experiences 
of those with disabilities are improved across the board.
    Passengers deserve transparency. That is why I joined 
Ranking Member Cohen and Senators Duckworth and Fischer to 
introduce the Prioritizing Accountability and Accessibility for 
Aviation Consumers Act. This bill would ensure accountability 
from the airlines and the Department of Transportation with 
regard to their effectiveness in directly resolving disability-
related complaints. And I strongly urge the committee to 
consider the inclusion of this bipartisan, bicameral initiative 
in the FAA Reauthorization Act.
    And lastly, Mr. Chairman, the noise pollution caused by 
aircraft and airports, when not addressed, is an unacceptable 
encroachment on so many of our communities: their health, their 
well-being, and their safety. Those of us that represent 
districts in and around airport regions--for my local 
constituents, the Trenton-Mercer Airport, although located in 
an entirely different State in Trenton, New Jersey, is situated 
such that planes take off and approach over lower Bucks County, 
unnecessarily disturbing residents and disrupting daily life. 
While small in size, this airport has sought to expand by 
adding two fully operational gates.
    Despite the fact that this will increase the number of 
annual flights by the thousands, the Trenton-Mercer Airport has 
failed to account for the impact these new gates will have, or 
to implement any noise reduction or mitigation strategies 
whatsoever. Congress can and must address the health and safety 
issues caused by aviation-related noise pollution, especially 
for vulnerable and underserved communities.
    And last week I was proud to join Representative Lynch in 
proposing a step in the right direction, the Air Traffic Noise 
and Pollution Expert Consensus Act. This bipartisan piece of 
legislation, which I urge this committee to consider for 
inclusion in the FAA reauthorization, would require a report on 
the health impacts of air traffic noise and pollution. And when 
making critical decisions about airports like Trenton-Mercer, 
the FAA should have to consider the opinion of our Nation's 
experts. Our community should not be left behind by Washington 
bureaucrats.
    Again, I thank you for the opportunity to testify today to 
both the chair and the ranking member. I look forward to 
continuing my work with this committee and all my colleagues on 
common-ground, commonsense solutions to transportation and 
infrastructure challenges in this upcoming Congress.
    Thank you for your time, and I yield back.

                              ----------                              


 Prepared Statement of Hon. Pete Aguilar, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of California
    I want to thank Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen for 
holding this Transportation and Infrastructure Member Day hearing and 
allowing me to speak about some of my priorities as the committee works 
on a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization bill.
  Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Supportive Services Program
    First, I urge the committee to include my bill, the Disadvantaged 
Business Enterprise (DBE) Supportive Services Expansion Act, in its FAA 
Reauthorization bill. This bill will create a DBE Supportive Services 
program under the FAA to help states provide training, assistance and 
services to minority, disadvantaged and women business enterprises. The 
program would be modeled after the DBE Supportive Services program 
under the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).
    Expanding this program under the FAA through FAA reauthorization 
will help DBEs facilitate these firms' development into viable, self-
sufficient organizations capable of competing for, and performing on 
federally assisted aviation projects.
                      Airport Improvement Program
    Furthermore, airports are a critical part of our nation's 
infrastructure and economy, but the primary funding mechanisms for 
their maintenance and modernization do not meet their current needs. 
Creating sustainable funding streams for airport infrastructure 
projects must be a priority in this FAA Reauthorization.
    In speaking with airports in my district and across the Inland 
Empire, a top priority for FAA Reauthorization is to increase the 
Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funding level from $3.35 billion to 
$4 billion. This authorization level has remained the same for almost 
two decades, despite the increased needs for airports to update their 
infrastructure and the increase in infrastructure projects overall 
following the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL).
    Additionally, AIP is one of the largest federal funding mechanisms 
for airports, but the programmatic restrictions make a variety of 
capital development projects ineligible. To address this, the BIL 
included provisions that enhanced AIP eligibility to give airports more 
flexibility on how to use those funds. This brought AIP more in line 
with requirements for the Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) program, 
which allows airports to use funds for FAA-approved projects that 
improve the safety, security and capacity of airports. For these 
reasons, I urge the Committee to expand AIP eligibility in FAA 
reauthorization to allow airports to tackle big projects without 
additional PFC funds.
    I want to close by once again thanking the Members of this 
Committee for working on FAA Reauthorization this year. I look forward 
to continuing my work with each of you as you develop this bill.

                                 
    Prepared Statement of Hon. Earl Blumenauer, a Representative in 
                   Congress From the State of Oregon
    Chair Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, thank you for the opportunity 
to testify before this committee today.
    Air travel is in flux right now. After two years where many of us 
often felt like the only person on a plane, airports are humming again. 
I walk around and it feels busier than ever. Yet people are stressed 
and on edge. I hear more worry about the environmental impact of both 
personal and business trips than I ever have in the past. Pilots and 
flight attendants are still exhausted from three years of the pandemic. 
Sometimes it feels like everyone in the airport is miserable. These are 
challenging times to be flying, to be dependent on flying, and to be 
making policy for the next five years of flying.
    You will hear a lot from my colleagues today on a myriad of issues, 
so I am just going to focus on three that I think will get less 
attention but are important issues for us to think about:
    First, preparing our airports for whatever comes next:
    Our airports are places for business and personal travel, they are 
also critical access points for emergency services and management. Just 
last week the Fort Lauderdale airport was shut down for more than a day 
after getting 24 inches of rain in a 24 hour period. We saw 
significantly more cancellations and airport shut downs than normal 
this winter due to extreme snow and ice. In the Pacific Northwest, 
airports are suddenly having to withstand multiples days and even weeks 
above 100 degrees. These once-in-a-century events are happening every 
other year now: for the sake of our economy, our airports need to be 
built or upgraded to be able to withstand these types of extreme 
weather events.
    Similarly, airports play a special role and function in emergency 
response, which means they must be prepared to withstand the emergency. 
My hometown airport, PDX, will have to serve as a main point of 
operations after a major earthquake. This is common and I bet that most 
of your district's emergency plans heavily rely on the functionality of 
the closest airport.
    The only problem is that it's unlikely any of their runways would 
survive a major earthquake.
    I urge the Committee to include language in FAA reauthorization 
that mirrors what was in a previous bill passed by the Committee (and 
abandoned by the Senate), which would provide grants to airports to 
invest in their runways to enable them to withstand the types of 
extreme weather events, earthquakes and other natural disasters we are 
seeing more and more of.
    Second, ensure airports can finance need improvements for travelers 
health, safety, and comfort:
    In previous Congresses I have introduced a bill to increase the 
Passenger Facility Charge to align with inflation. That charge hasn't 
been increased since 2003 and is wildly inadequate compared to the need 
and expectations for today's airport facilities. I know that these are 
hard conversations and I'm not here today to tell you what the answer 
should be. But I do know that, as wonderful as the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law is, if we don't take steps to sustainably pay for 
our infrastructure needs, to invest in the airports and the runways and 
the security systems that we need, passing a huge piece of 
infrastructure investment every seventy years is not going to be 
enough.
    I urge the Committee to engage in a robust discussion about long-
term investment in our aviation system, the importance of the user-fee 
system, and ensuring airports meet the needs of modern travelers.
    Third, finally, I ask the Committee to remember that people getting 
to the airport is as important as moving them through the airport. This 
Committee has previously acknowledged the importance of consistent, 
reliable transit connections to the airport. Most of the major 
international airports in the US are upgrading their transit 
connections to the airport, both for the people using the airport and 
for the people working at the airport. I hope that the Committee 
remembers that connections between an airport and the closest urban 
area can be as important to the functioning of the airport as the 
actual flight.
    Thank you for your time today.

                                 
   Prepared Statement of Hon. Suzanne Bonamici, a Representative in 
                   Congress From the State of Oregon
    Good morning. Thank you Chair Graves and Ranking Member Larsen for 
the opportunity to address the Committee.
    I have long advocated for long-term and practical solutions to our 
nation's crumbling infrastructure and to the climate crisis. Our recent 
efforts to improve transportation and infrastructure have been 
significant to this work. Long-term investments in transportation and 
infrastructure boost the economy, generate jobs, and promote commerce 
by protecting disadvantaged populations, lowering carbon emissions, 
increasing energy efficiency, and reconstructing systems sustainably 
and resiliently. New infrastructure programs should invest in projects 
that reduce pollution and use natural infrastructure solutions.
    It is commonly and correctly assumed that surface transportation 
infrastructure must be repaired, maintained, and built. Yet in the 
Northwest, we know that a complete infrastructure plan must include 
more than just roads and bridges. We need more accessible multi-modal 
public transportation, strong broadband internet, affordable housing, 
improved water systems, port repairs, and updated public schools, and 
we need to decarbonize the transportation sector. Innovative 
transportation projects in the district I represent in NW Oregon, like 
the Beaverton Loop and Merlo Bus Garage Zero Emission Retrofit, will 
help more people get to work, school, and other destinations in the 
community more quickly and reliably while reducing emissions by 
decreasing the number of vehicles on our roads. I'm also advancing 
projects recognizing the need to enhance our resiliency before a 
Cascadia Subduction Zone event, which is overdue in the Northwest.
    Furthermore, the variety of climate effects around the country can 
cause travel and cargo delays as well as temporary or even permanent 
closures of highways, bridges, tunnels, ports, and airports. Exposure 
to flooding, wildfires, and extremely high temperatures reduces the 
lifespan of infrastructure and raises maintenance costs, jeopardizes 
worker safety, and obstructs vital access to evacuation routes. We must 
continue to make sustainable and resilient roads, highways, and runways 
a top priority.
    Some of the most challenging decarbonization issues are presented 
by off-road transportation, such as aviation and maritime. As we 
approach legislation for the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) 
reauthorization, I would like to highlight recommendations that are 
priorities of mine:
      Continue Federal research on solutions for aviation, 
including electrification and decarbonization;
      Continue RDD&D for low-carbon alternative fuels, 
including next generation feedstocks, biofuels, and bioderived 
chemicals; low-carbon building and infrastructure and materials; and 
solutions for medium- and heavy-duty, and off-road transportation, 
including rail, aviation, and maritime;
      Continue to provide tax incentives and grant support for 
low-emission aviation technology and sustainable aviation fuels that 
reduce carbon pollution;
      Continue to expand the Federal Aviation Administration's 
grant programs for cleaning up airport ground support equipment;
      Provide additional credit for SAF and clarify that low-
carbon shipping fuels are eligible under the Renewable Fuel Standard or 
a future Federal Low Carbon Fuel Standard; and
      Continue to provide grants to expedite port 
electrification, reduce emissions from port operations, and upgrade 
ports for offshore wind development.

    When the House last considered FAA reauthorization, one of my 
priorities was to give people a voice and a remedy when they have a 
dispute with airline companies. My amendment to create the Aviation 
Consumer Advocate was signed into law in our last bipartisan 
reauthorization. This Advocate is dedicated to helping travelers 
navigate the Aviation Consumer Protection Division and to work to 
resolve problems that arise with airlines. As the Committee begins 
considering reauthorization, I urge you to further enhance consumer 
protections for the millions of Americans who fly every day. I am eager 
to work with you to determine how the Aviation Consumer Advocate 
position can be strengthened to secure travel with dignity for 
everyone.
    Additionally, in last year's Water Resources Development Act, I 
submitted a handful of priorities that were incorporated in the final 
bill, including a request that the United States Army Corps of 
Engineers provide Congress a report detailing the challenges associated 
with dredging the Lower Willamette River, particularly the area of the 
channel that falls within the Portland Harbor Superfund site. I request 
that the Committee provide thorough and timely oversight on the 
implementation of these actions.
    Further, I am grateful for the passage of the $1.2 trillion 
bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provided $550 
billion in new spending to invest in our nation's roads, bridges, water 
infrastructure, transmission system, broadband, and more. I appreciate 
the Committee's oversight on the implementation of this funding and, 
specifically, the billions of dollars in funding for port 
infrastructure upgrades, the Army Corps' massive backlog of authorized 
projects, and waterways that will create two million good-paying jobs 
per year over the course of the decade.
    As a Senior Member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology, and having spent four years on the Select Committee on the 
Climate Crisis, I recognize that the challenges to meet the many needs 
facing this country are great. As this Committee advances legislation 
to improve our Nation's transportation systems and infrastructure, I 
stand ready to support you and your efforts to do so in a sustainable 
and resilient manner for the betterment of our communities and the 
health of the planet.
    Thank you.

                                 
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Ed Case, a Representative in Congress From 
                          the State of Hawaii
    Chair Graves, Ranking Member Larsen and Members of the Committee:
    Aloha and mahalo for the opportunity to update the Committee on key 
transportation and infrastructure issues and needs for both our nation 
and my home state of Hawai`i. I want to highlight three priorities 
today for your consideration and assistance with incorporating into the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act of 2023: (1) 
modernizing FAA infrastructure; (2) supporting the aviation workforce; 
and (3) addressing the inadequate safety and community disruption 
regulation of commercial helicopter and small aircraft operations.
    As an island state located fully 2,500 miles off the coast of 
California, Hawai`i is uniquely challenged by its geographic isolation 
which makes our state heavily reliant on air transportation. Current 
FAA infrastructure is insufficient to handle our nation's aviation 
needs, and this compounds for a fully reliant location such as Hawai`i. 
For example, a 2021 Office of Inspector General report warned that the 
``FAA has struggled to integrate key NextGen technologies and 
capabilities due to extended program delays that have caused ripple 
effect delays'' nationwide. This has impacted Hawai`i in particular. 
Additionally, in Hawai`i we are still working through our nearly $3 
billion investment to modernize the Daniel K. Inouye International 
Airport that causes regular delays and inconveniences for residents and 
tourist alike. To help prevent any further degradation to our air 
transportation system, I urge the Committee to continue to support 
investments in new technologies and infrastructure projects to meet 
this critical challenge.
    In addition to investments in physical and software infrastructure, 
we also need to support the workforce that is responsible for executing 
them. Similar to far too many industries across our nation, the 
aviation workforce is in dire need of supplementation and other 
assistance. Efforts to recruit and retain a strong aviation workforce 
are pivotal to maintaining a safe and effective aviation industry. We 
need to expand programs like the Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan 
and Aviation Workforce Development Grants that provide support to 
academia and the aviation community to help prepare a more inclusive 
talent pool of pilots, aviation maintenance technicians, air traffic 
controllers and others.
    Finally, I ask for the Committee's full support to address the 
threats caused by reckless commercial helicopter and small aircraft 
operations. In many parts of the country, but especially Hawai`i, these 
operations have accelerated rapidly in recent years with often deadly 
safety consequences following. Yet regulatory capacity and commitment 
by the FAA has not kept pace, with tragic and widespread consequences.
    In particular, the FAA must be held accountable for not adopting 
nor implementing the safety recommendations made by the National 
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The NTSB, which reviews incidents 
but cannot regulate changes, has concluded that existing safety-related 
regulation of commercial tour helicopters and small aircraft skydiving 
operations is insufficient. The FAA's states that its primary if not 
exclusive mission is to maximize the safe and effective use of the 
nation's airspace, yet the FAA has demonstrated a blatant disregard for 
legitimate safety recommendations and failed to fully implement 
mechanisms to increase the safety of their operations, putting both 
consumers and employees at risk. I urge the Committee to include 
mandates which would require the FAA to implement safety 
recommendations as directed by the NTSB.
    These operations have also disrupted whole communities with 
excessive noise and other impacts, destroyed the peace and sanctity of 
special places and weakened security and management of national 
security operations. The FAA states very plainly that its 
responsibility is strictly operational safety and national airspace 
efficiency and does not extend to ground disruption and other negative 
impacts, yet it will not concede to any other jurisdiction any ability 
to reasonably regulate for such disruption, creating a void in which 
the operators are virtually free to fly wherever, whenever and as often 
as they want. And they do, with little to no self-regulation.
    Like many other highly-trafficked locations across the country, 
communities across Hawai`i have experienced a significant increase in 
noise effects of constant commercial aviation operations, especially 
helicopter and small aircraft operations. These include our precious 
national parks, which are disturbed by thousands upon thousands of tour 
overflights a year. In their case, the National Parks Air Tour 
Management Act requires the FAA and the National Park Service to create 
Air Tour Management Plans (ATMPs) or achieve voluntary agreements for 
mitigating these disruptions. But such disruptions are equal if not 
greater to communities and other locations beyond national park 
boundaries. In some cases, the FAA and the operators have adopted 
Common Air Tours Procedures Manuals (CATPM), which have had some 
limited effect on mitigating such disruptions, but these are voluntary 
and in Hawai`i have been abandoned by the FAA and operators. The FAA 
appears to be unclear as to (1) whether its statutory and regulatory 
jurisdiction beyond national park boundaries encompasses a 
responsibility to mitigate noise and other community disruptions and 
(2) whether it has the authority to pursue ATMPS, CATPMs or other means 
toward time, place and manner restrictions, or to impose such 
restrictions absent such agreements. We must clarify that the FAA's 
responsibilities encompass such concerns.
    I need and ask for this Committee's assistance in resolving this 
intolerable situation with commercial helicopter and small aircraft 
operations. I seek your support for H.R. 1071, my Safe and Quiet Skies 
Act, which would require the FAA to implement the NTSB's recommended 
enhanced safety regulations; prohibit flights over certain federal 
properties, to include military installations, national cemeteries and 
national parks; require standard equipment to monitor the location of 
flights; prevent pilots from also serving as tour guides; and limit 
decibel levels to those commonly applied to operations in residential 
areas.
    Additionally, I seek your support for the Hawai`i Air Tour 
Management Plan Act and the Air Tour and Sport Parachuting Safety 
Improvement Act, which the Hawai`i Congressional delegation introduced 
last week in both the House and Senate. Our Hawai`i Air Tour Management 
Plan Act (H.R. 2585 in the House) would establish certain parts of 
Hawai`i as an air tour management zone, similar to what is established 
by law to protect our most vulnerable national parks. Our Air Tour and 
Sport Parachuting Safety Improvement Act (H.R. 2626 in the House) would 
reform FAA safety requirements for commercial air tour operators. Under 
the bill, ground disruptions must be accounted for and addressed by the 
FAA as it is a considerable impact of its operating apparatus. 
Combined, these bills are alternative means by which to achieve many of 
the underlying goals from the Safe and Quiet Skies Act.
    In closing, I want to extend my warmest mahalo for your leadership 
in fixing our nation's transportation and infrastructure and for your 
consideration of Hawaii's critical needs, which are shared by other 
isolated and/or high usage jurisdictions.

                                 
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Kathy Castor, a Representative in Congress 
                       From the State of Florida
RE: Transportation Priorities for the Tampa Bay Area

    Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
    Thank you for the opportunity to highlight important transportation 
priorities that will improve the lives of my neighbors in the Tampa Bay 
area. Significant investments in transportation and infrastructure are 
vital to the economic well-being of my neighbors and small businesses, 
and directly tied to higher-paying jobs. I urge the Committee to 
prioritize communities that have all too often been left out of or 
harmed by transportation decisions that impact housing, health, and 
employment.
    One of the most important ways the Committee can help my neighbors 
in the Tampa Bay area is to support the implementation of both the 
historical Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation 
Reduction Act. These initiatives are a once-in-a-lifetime chance to 
create millions of good-paying union jobs while bringing our 
infrastructure into the 21st century, address the climate crisis and 
provide wide-ranging opportunities for everyone. Implementing these new 
laws should be the Committee's highest priority. I urge the Committee 
to be ambitious and strategic in crafting a modern transportation 
package with an eye to creating a healthy, resilient, and just America.
    Below are some of my top priorities for the Tampa Bay Area:
    1.  Tampa International Airport (TPA) and its high-quality, 
customer-friendly experience makes it one of America's best airports. 
Behind the scenes, however, I am very concerned with the poor state of 
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control tower. 
The tower was built in 1972 and has had serious issues with asbestos, 
poor plumbing, structural deficiencies, fire protection systems, roof 
leaks, cracked windows, and more. While I am encouraged that the Biden 
Administration has committed to replacing the TPA tower in the FAA's 
FY24 Budget Request, we need to ensure that the replacement is fully 
funded, and the process is fully transparent. In fact, as currently 
constituted, the FAA's air traffic control tower replacement process is 
completely opaque, and the Committee should require additional 
transparency measures in the upcoming FAA reauthorization such as 
insight into the selection criteria and process.
          In addition to the deficient tower, TPA and other airports 
need additional investments. Other priorities include expanding the 
authorization of the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) to $4 billion, 
expanding AIP eligible projects to mirror Passenger Facility Charge 
(PFC) eligibility, and creating an FAA led initiative to assist 
airports in moving to fluorine-free firefighting foams.
          During the last FAA reauthorization bill, I introduced an 
amendment to increase the modest passenger facility fee and cap airline 
baggage fees. Airline baggage fees and the uncertainty they generate 
among the traveling public should be addressed. For more than a decade, 
airlines dramatically hiked baggage fees and profited. Baggage fees are 
not subject to the same federal tax as airfares that help fund the 
Airport and Airway Trust Fund and support the FAA. I encourage the 
Committee to rein in exorbitant baggage fees and make travel more 
affordable for everyone, while helping to keep our airports modern and 
up-to-date.
          Lastly, I am encouraged that Ranking Member Larsen is making 
environmental sustainability a focus of this FAA reauthorization. It is 
critical that we use this package to address the climate crisis by 
reducing rising aircraft emissions through technology and sustainable 
aviation fuel, building climate resilient infrastructure, and removing 
PFAS from our airports.

    2.  The transportation sector is the largest source of climate 
pollution, emitting nearly one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions in 
the United States and America's transportation system still runs 
primarily on fuels derived from oil. The Inflation Reduction Act made 
unprecedented investments in electrifying the transportation sector. 
However, there is more that needs to be done. There must be continued 
innovation and investments to address the toughest decarbonization 
challenges. Transportation using heavy-duty trucks, maritime, and 
aviation systems continue to be difficult to decarbonize, so Congress 
must work diligently to provide workable solutions.

    3.  Port Tampa Bay is Florida's largest port and serves West and 
Central Florida and the Southeastern United States. Ship repair and 
bulk cargo jobs are invaluable to the Port. And rail connections to the 
port move freight efficiently and are in need of expansion as the port 
grows with access for ships transiting the Panama Canal and the 
Caribbean transshipment facilities. It is critically important the 
Committee continues to authorize the MARAD Port Infrastructure 
Development initiatives which ensure resources are available to make 
port landside and waterside connections. Additionally, the Tampa Harbor 
main channel is authorized to a depth of 43 feet and was last modified 
over fifty years ago by the 1970 Rivers and Harbors Act. Additional 
depth is needed due to the dramatic increase in new and larger global 
vessels utilizing the Tampa federal channel. Current navigational 
challenges include insufficient draft which restricts fully loaded 
container ships to transit during high tide and one-way travel when the 
container ships are in the channel. The Tampa Harbor General 
Reevaluation Report (GRR), which is underway, is an essential first 
step to achieving a modification to the Tampa Harbor project. This 
study must remain on schedule for an authorization to be included in 
the 2024 WRDA bill that provides for an authorized draft of at least 47 
feet. This will ensure that Port Tampa Bay continues to play a 
significant role in the supply chain of Florida's residents and 
businesses and that it continues to afford compatibility for major 
ports within the Gulf of Mexico.

    4.  The overriding priority for the growing Tampa Bay community is 
to improve mobility, reduce congestion and improve equity through a 
multi-modal strategy, particularly through expanded transit. The 
Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority (HART) needs to 
substantially expand bus service, electrify its bus fleet, and extend 
the popular Tampa Streetcar. HART is also working to repair 
approximately 100 bus stops in Hillsborough County to address equity, 
safety, and accessibility issues, bringing the stops into compliance 
with the ADA and making them cleaner and safer with the$5 million in 
community project funding HART received in FY23. These projects will 
have an outsized impact on providing transportation solutions to our 
hardworking neighbors, who have historically been under-prioritized 
when it comes to infrastructure. We need a robust partnership with the 
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to move these projects from the 
planning stages to implementation.

    5.  The Cross Bay Ferry Plan (``Ferry Plan'') is a unique public-
private partnership between Hillsborough County, Pinellas County, St. 
Petersburg, Tampa, and HMS Ferries. The Ferry Plan was developed to 
become the region's inaugural permanent ferry service between Downtown 
Tampa and St. Petersburg, bolstering cross-bay connections, and 
protecting our neighbors from harmful air pollution. This new system 
serves both residents and tourists, creating a new transit option for 
work or tourist destinations. The Ferry Plan is working to expand 
operation times, fleet size and adding South Hillsborough County and 
MacDill AFB as additional destinations, providing opportunities to get 
cars off the road and improving commuting times for our service members 
and their families. We welcome a Federal Transit Authority role in 
expanding this ferry service.

    6.  Pinellas Sun Coast Transit Authority (PSTA) is Pinellas 
County's transit agency and operates in the most densely populated 
county in Florida. PSTA is working to realize a healthy community and 
workforce through integration of environmental, financial, and social 
sustainability in all areas of the agency. PSTA provides free, 
accessible, rapid transportation and is working to implement its first 
Sustainable Strategic Plan (SSP). It is essential there are clean 
alternatives and technologies for buses and trucks to alleviate 
environmental justice concerns about air pollution from conventional 
technologies. One area of focus for the SSP is promoting a culture of 
energy efficiency and conservation through reduced energy consumption 
and an eventual complete transition to an electric and or hybrid bus 
fleet.
          PSTA recently launched their SunRunner Rising Development 
Study in support of the SunRunner Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) initiative, 
connecting communities across St. Petersburg with free and accessible 
transportation. This study is funded by the FTA's Transit-Oriented 
Development (TOD) Pilot Program, informing operation of the BRT by 
providing recommendations for land use strategies and equitable 
economic principles. PSTA recognizes the need to increase connectivity 
across neighborhoods to address diversity and equity to fully serve its 
community. During FY22, the FTA awarded the authority's South St. 
Petersburg Community Redevelopment Area Mobility study with $360,000. 
This initiative focuses on improving and expanding reliable 
transportation in low-income areas.

    7.  Safety enhancements and pathways for bicycles and pedestrians 
are a high priority for the Tampa Bay area. My community unfortunately 
ranks high in the number of pedestrian and bicyclist deaths. The Cities 
of Tampa and St. Petersburg have implemented Vision Zero initiatives to 
eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe injuries, while increasing 
safe, healthy, and equitable mobility for all. We need resources to 
help redesign streets and expand trails to make it safer and more 
convenient for people to walk and bike. In addition, with an increasing 
population of transportation disadvantaged neighbors, we must expand 
paratransit services. More sidewalks and trails increase safety and 
improve access to transit for all users of a multi-modal transportation 
system, including persons with disabilities and the elderly.
          I am pleased that my district is a recipient of the Safe 
Streets and Roads for All Grant program via Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law. This initiative provides a $20M federal grant, with a $5M local 
match, aimed at improving the safety of our streets to reduce traffic 
accidents and deaths. We currently have three projects ready for 
construction: Avenida Republica de Cuba (14th St) in Historic Ybor 
City, the intersection between MacDill Avenue and Armenia Avenue, and 
safety projects for Twiggs Street in Downtown Tampa and Habana Avenue 
in West Tampa. Pinellas County is also working with the grant program 
to implement projects throughout the area to improve safety for 
residents.

    8.  The Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and 
Equity, or RAISE Discretionary Grant program, is a DOT initiative which 
invests in road, rail, transit, and port projects that further national 
agendas. I helped secure a number of grants for the Tampa Riverwalk 
which the community leveraged into major redevelopment, new private 
capital investment, and a more livable downtown--which is now being 
connected to West Tampa and other neighborhoods. A recent grant helped 
fund construction of the Tampa-Hillsborough Expressway Authority 
downtown greenway that provides a shaded pedestrian travel way. 
Improving access to green spaces, public recreation opportunities, and 
nature will continue to be important. By enabling bikeable and walkable 
communities, supporting transit, and foregoing unneeded highway 
capacity expansions that worsen congestion, federal and state policy 
could both reduce pollution and improve safety. We need more of these 
investments on a more frequent basis. I am also pleased that the DOT 
awarded the Tampa Port Authority with $12.6 million to construct a new 
Berth 301 at the Port Redwing facility, which will connect Berths 300 
and 302 with a 1,025-foot dock. This new construction will reduce truck 
miles and vessel idling times, add ship capacity to address supply 
chain challenges and create more than 800 full time jobs. In the first 
year of operations, the Port estimates that the project will reduce 
truck travel by 2.84 million miles and reduce 7,722 tons of emissions, 
while saving on highway infrastructure maintenance.
          Additionally, the area also received grants towards the 
Clearwater Multimodal Transit Center in 2022; in 2021, an award was 
given to the Tampa Heights Mobility Corridor; in 2020, an award was 
given to the Tampa Multimodal Network and Safety Improvements; in 2020, 
an award was given to the I-75/Big Bend Road Mobility and Access 
Project; in 2012, an award was given to the Tampa Downtown Multimodal 
Improvements' and in 2010, an award was given to the Port Manatee 
Marine Highway. We are grateful for these federal investments in safer 
and more accessible communities.

    9.  Capital Investment Grants Program is an FTA initiative which 
invests in transit capital investments, including heavy rail, commuter 
rail, light rail, streetcars, and bus rapid transit. I am pleased to 
share that Tampa was a recipient during FY22, receiving $99.90 Million 
for Tampa Streetcar Extension and Modernization. This project will help 
fill critical gaps in the existing network and improve transit 
connections to better serve travel demands. Grants like this are 
paramount to cities like Tampa and St. Petersburg to help modernize its 
infrastructure.

    10.  Investment to protect clean water is also critical. We should 
ensure that improvements to water infrastructure, like those undertaken 
by the Army Corps of Engineers, incorporate the latest climate science 
and are built to deal with the impacts of a rapidly warming world. We 
know this first-hand in Hillsborough County, which continues to 
struggle with the impacts of a lack of resilient water infrastructure. 
There is also the St. Pete's Water Plan aiming to improve stormwater 
quality, reduce flooding and mitigate the impacts of sea level rise. A 
permanent green reserve as part of revolving fund capitalization grants 
and providing grants to increase the resilience of wastewater 
facilities would improve the long-term resilience of critical 
infrastructure for communities like Tampa Bay.

    11.  The City of Tampa has done a tremendous amount of research 
into the history of racially discriminatory historical decisions in 
highway planning, and has documented the ties between the Tampa White 
Municipal Party, racially discriminatory maps and policies in the Tampa 
Comprehensive Plan, and the Tampa Highways Plan of the first half of 
the 20th century, that led to the bulldozing of multiple African 
American neighborhoods for the present-day routes of I-275 and I-4. The 
disproportionate burdens created by these explicitly discriminatory 
practices continue to be felt today in public health, household income, 
access to opportunity.
          In light of this, the DOT has awarded the City of Tampa more 
than $5 million via the Reconnecting Communities Pilot Grant Program, 
which will help improve the Ashley Drive Interchange and better connect 
neighborhoods to Downtown Tampa. The initiative will lower the Ashley 
Drive Interchange Ramp to street level removing the viaduct elevating 
the extended highway exit ramp. The project will then reconnect the 
North Downtown Street grid with a new street-level Ashley Drive, making 
it safer and easier to walk and bike around downtown Tampa. We welcome 
the Federal Highway Administration's role in acknowledging the negative 
impacts created in the past and investing in impacted communities of 
Tampa and St. Petersburg to reconnect bisected neighborhoods, reduce 
air pollutants with walls and vegetation, and improve walk/bike/transit 
infrastructure to expand access. It is imperative to meet the necessary 
climate commitments that we continue to implement the landmark 
investments made last Congress and continue to address the difficult 
decarbonization challenges through the electrification of America.

    I appreciate your consideration of the aforementioned requests. If 
you have any questions, please contact my Legislative Assistant.

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Henry Cuellar, a Representative in Congress 
                        From the State of Texas
    Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
    As the Committee continues its work on the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) Reauthorization, I wish to submit the following 
priorities for consideration in the upcoming legislation:
    1.  Increase the number of slot exemptions available for air 
carriers to operate on routes beyond the perimeter described in 49 
U.S.C. Sec. 49109 to and from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport 
(DCA) to allow for two non-stop slots (one daily round trip) to and 
from San Antonio International Airport (SAT) and DCA.
          The Perimeter Rule established in 49 U.S.C. Sec. 49109 limits 
service to and from DCA to 1,250 statute miles. San Antonio is located 
1,381 statute miles from DCA. Nonstop service to and from DCA and SAT 
would create a direct connection between both cities and would 
accommodate the large amount of passenger traffic between these 
destinations due to their shared military, medical, and technology 
sectors.

    2.  Increase authorized funding for the Airport Improvement Program 
(AIP) from $3,350,000,000 to $5,000,000,000 per fiscal year.
          This program provides critical funding to enhance airport 
safety and capacity. Because of consistent demand exceeding funding 
availability, the authorized level of funding for this program should 
be increased to allow more airports to make critical infrastructure 
improvements. Projects funded by this program are vital to ensuring 
American competitiveness and the security of our supply chains.

    3.  Reevaluate metrics used to determine the threshold of 
significant aircraft noise in regards to Airport Noise Compatibility 
Planning (14 C.F.R. Part 150).
          Reassessing the use of ``day-night average sound level'' 
(DNL) and the current threshold of 65 decibels as an indicator of 
significant aircraft noise will ensure FAA is utilizing up-to-date 
metrics that reflect the impact of noise on airport communities. The 
current 65 decibel threshold was determined using data from 1978. 
Reevaluating the threshold of significant noise levels will ensure FAA 
accurately measures community sensitivity to aircraft noise and that 
these communities will have access to federal funds for noise 
mitigation projects.

    Thank you for your consideration. Please do not hesitate to reach 
out to me or my Legislative Director should you have any questions or 
require additional information.

                                 
   Prepared Statement of Hon. Suzan K. DelBene, a Representative in 
                 Congress From the State of Washington
    Dear Chair Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on and share my 
priorities for the upcoming Federal Aviation Administration 
reauthorization package. As you craft this legislation, we have a 
unique opportunity to support and accelerate decarbonization efforts 
across the aviation industry, which is exactly what my bill, the 
Transportation Innovation Coordination Act, would do.
    In the bipartisan infrastructure law, Congress created the Joint 
Office of Energy and Transportation (``Joint Office'') and charged it 
with implementing the National Electric Vehicle Charging program and 
other programs that support zero-emission fueling infrastructure, and 
zero-emission transit and school buses. Stakeholders who have worked 
with the Joint Office have found it to be an incredible resource, 
providing technical assistance, coordinating relevant grant programs, 
and more. Stakeholders across the transportation sector are eager for 
similar support and coordination across their respective modes, calling 
for expansion of the Joint Office's mandate to include other modes and 
types of fuels beyond passenger electric vehicles.
    My bill would expand the Joint Office's mandate to include the 
decarbonization of aircraft and airports, maritime vessels and 
seaports, and medium- and heavy-duty transportation. I worked with a 
broad coalition of stakeholders in crafting this legislation who are 
supportive of expanding the authorization of the Joint Office, 
including state agencies like the Washington State Department of 
Commerce and innovative aviation companies like ZeroAvia.
    On March 29, 2023, the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation 
Committee held a hearing on Advancing Next Generation Aviation 
Technologies, where ZeroAvia testified. ZeroAvia is a U.S. company with 
a Washington state presence that is building zero-emission, hydrogen-
electric aircraft propulsion systems for aircraft. In their testimony, 
ZeroAvia highlighted the need for better coordination between DOE and 
DOT in certifying these new emerging technologies and expressed support 
for expanding the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation's to 
include sustainable aviation.\i\ This expansion is a key component of 
my Transportation Innovation Coordination Act and would help ensure the 
U.S. continues to lead when it comes to innovative and sustainable 
aviation.

    Earlier, this year, I had the opportunity to visit the Arlington 
Airport in my district and see firsthand the work that innovative 
aviation companies like Eviation, a battery-powered aircraft 
manufacturer, are doing and how they and others can benefit from 
greater cross-agency collaboration and coordination. In addition, as 
Washington's aviation industry continues to grow, with Snohomish County 
also recently announcing a partnership with Washington State University 
(WSU) to establish a Research & Development Center focused on 
Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) at Paine Field Airport, expansion of 
the Joint Office is an important step to supporting the sustainable 
aviation ecosystem in my region.\ii\

    Washington state is a leader in clean energy and our industries are 
leading the way in decarbonization across other modes as well. For 
example, the Port of Seattle is exploring the creation of the first 
green cruise corridor to Alaska and the Northwest Seaport Alliance is 
partnering with the Republic of Korea to study creation of a green 
shipping corridor.\iii\ \iv\ PACCAR, one of the largest manufacturers 
of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world and headquartered in my 
district in Bellevue, WA, is investing in zero-emission commercial 
vehicles through the development of battery and fuel cell electric 
vehicles. These are just a few examples of stakeholders in my state who 
stand to see immense benefit from greater coordination between the 
federal agencies with jurisdiction over decarbonization, which is why I 
respectfully request you include the Transportation Innovation 
Coordination Act in the FAA reauthorization package.

    The administration has also made decarbonizing the transportation 
sector, which is currently responsible for one-third of all U.S. 
greenhouse gas emissions, a top priority by releasing the ``U.S. 
National Blueprint for Transportation Decarbonization: A Joint Strategy 
to Transform Transportation'' earlier this year.\v\ Expanding the 
authorization of the Joint Office would create a natural coordinating 
body to carry forward implementation of this blueprint. Furthermore, as 
the administration moves to decarbonize the trucking industry through 
new emissions standards, the provisions included in my legislation 
around supporting decarbonization of medium- and heavy-duty transport 
will help ensure the federal government is providing the appropriate 
resources, guideposts, and tools to help the industry transition to a 
cleaner fleet.

    This bill is endorsed by the Truck & Engine Manufacturers 
Association and the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association. I have 
included a copy of this legislation as an attachment to my written 
testimony. In addition, I have provided a letter of support from 
stakeholders in the aviation industry for expanding the scope of the 
Joint Office.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to share my priorities for the 
FAA reauthorization package with the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee. Please contact [name and email removed by editor] on my 
staff for any additional information the Committee requires about the 
items discussed above.

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Debbie Dingell, a Representative in Congress 
                       From the State of Michigan
    Thank you, Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, for holding 
this hearing for members to highlight their priorities in the 
jurisdiction of the House Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure for the 118th Congress.
    Today, I would like to focus specifically on my key priorities 
related to our nation's airports as the Committee considers important 
reauthorization legislation for the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA).
    As you know, the current authorization (Public Law No: 115-254) for 
the FAA expires at the end of fiscal year 2023. In order to ensure our 
civil aviation system--the most complex air transportation system in 
the world--does not endure any disruptions to operations, safety, or 
efficiency, we will need to work together, Republicans and Democrats, 
to advance meaningful, bipartisan reauthorization legislation.
    Since I have been in office, one of my highest priorities has been 
working across the aisle to address the crisis of ``forever chemical'' 
facing communities in every district across the United States. This is 
a bipartisan problem and deserves bipartisan solutions.
    Forever chemicals--known as per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
(PFAS)--are harmful man-made chemicals that have so far been found in 
the drinking water of more than 2,000 communities across almost every 
state in the country, in everyday consumer products, and nearly 400 
military sites across the United States have identified harmful PFAS 
contamination, according to the Environmental Working Group. PFAS 
chemicals are persistent, bio-accumulative, and toxic. These chemicals 
have been linked to harmful human health effects, including cancer, 
reproductive and developmental harms, and weaken immune systems.
    We know nearly every American now has some level of PFAS coursing 
through their blood after generations of uses to create our modern 
society.
    For decades now, one of the main sources of PFAS contamination into 
the environment has been from both military and civilian airports. Due 
to government regulations and the effectiveness of forever chemicals 
used in emergency response, airports nation wide have been required to 
stock, train, and use aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF), a type of foam 
used to fight fires, which contain high levels of PFAS.
    In order to protect human health and our environment it is critical 
for our nation's airports to transition from AFFF to PFAS-free 
firefighting foam alternatives as soon as possible. Congress has acted 
but we need to do more to solidify this transition.
    For instance, in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2020, Congress required the Department of Defense to update 
firefighting foam standards by January 31, 2023, and are also known as 
military specifications, or mil spec. The Federal Aviation 
Administration requires U.S. civilian airports to meet the military's 
standards.
    The Department of Defense updated those standards on January 6, 
2023. On January 12, 2023, the FAA issued an alert stating it will 
accept the use of foams at airports that meet the new mil spec 
requirements. Airports will be able to purchase fluorine-free foams as 
soon as foams meeting the mil spec are added to the U.S. Navy's 
qualified product list, which should happen in the coming months.
    That same law also required the Department of Defense to stop 
buying PFAS-based foams by October 1, 2023, and stop using them 
entirely by October 1, 2024.
    While the FAA and the Department of Defense continue to research 
safe, PFAS-free firefighting foam alternatives, there is still harmful 
AFFF in use today at U.S. airports. The time is now to get serious and 
ensure the safe transition to safer alternative at our nation's 
airports to protect our first responders, the public, and our 
environment.
    Therefore, I would strongly urge the members of this Committee to 
consider including a provision in any FAA reauthorization legislation 
that would explicitly state that no airport, not later than three years 
after the date of enactment of this legislation, shall be eligible for 
federal funding until such an airport has transitioned to the use of 
fluorine-free firefighting foam for all airport rescue and firefighting 
activities, including but not limited to fire emergencies, training, 
and equipment testing.
    Thank you in advance for considering this request as the Committee 
moves forward with hearings, legislation, and markups to advance a 
bipartisan FAA reauthorization for the years ahead.
    If you have any questions or require any additional information, 
please contact me or my staff. I stand ready to work with the Committee 
in any capacity to include these priorities, which will help strengthen 
our air transportation system in the United States, as well as protect 
human health and our environment for generations to come.
    Thank you.

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Byron Donalds, a Representative in Congress 
                       From the State of Florida
    Thank you Mr. Chairman for the opportunity to testify in front of 
the committee to discuss a few of my legislative initiatives. Overall, 
I seek the following bills be included in this year's Water Resources 
Development Act (WRDA): (1) the Water Quality & Environmental 
Innovation Act; (2) the Combat Harmful Algal Blooms Act; and (3) the 
Water Quality Oversight Act. Additionally, I seek that the Pre-Pilot 
Pathway Act be included in this year's Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) Reauthorization Act.
    To begin, I represent Florida's 19th District which covers Lee 
County and Collier County in Southwest Florida. Water is the lifeblood 
of FL-19 and I'm proud to say that water is my office's number one 
priority. With that being said, I wanted to provide a short overview of 
each of the water bills that I seek to be included in this year's WRDA.
    First, I seek that the bipartisan Water Quality & Environmental 
Innovation Act be included in this year's WRDA bill. My creative piece 
of legislation repurposes unnecessary federal waste to ultimately 
provide funding for innovative projects that aim to combat our nation's 
water quality and environmental challenges. Specifically, this bill 
takes unused money that lacks a designated purpose from EPA's Motor 
Vehicle and Engine Compliance program to provide grants and contracts 
for projects that utilize innovative technologies--such as artificial 
intelligence (AI), quantum, eDNA, aquaculture, etc. This outside-the-
box piece of legislation would provide vital funding--without raising 
the federal deficit--to combat various environmental challenges such as 
hydrologic alterations, sea-level rise, harmful algal blooms, etc.
    Next, I seek that the Combat Harmful Algal Blooms Act be included 
in this year's WRDA bill. This bill is simple--to add harmful algal 
blooms to the applicability of a Major Disaster Declaration. My 
district is currently facing a devastating red tide/blue-green algae 
event--and these algal blooms aren't constrained to my district alone. 
The vast amount of bipartisan support on this bill speaks for itself, 
and I believe this commonsense piece of legislation could make a great 
difference for FL-19, the State of Florida, and the entire United 
States.
    Finally, I seek that the Water Quality Oversight Act be included in 
this year's WRDA bill. This is another simple, commonsense bill that 
seeks oversight of federal funding provided to the Army Corp of 
Engineers (Corp.) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the 
purpose of combatting water quality challenges. In other words, this 
bill seeks to understand whether certain federal water quality projects 
have met their previous intent and desired metric results. As our 
nation's debt continues to skyrocket out of control, it's important to 
understand how federal funds are being spent and whether they actually 
have achieved their desired result. Overall, my simple bill seeks to 
provide the necessary federal oversight to reign in unnecessary waste 
and abuse potentially occurring throughout the Corp. and EPA.
    Finally, I seek that the Pre-Pilot Pathway Act be included in this 
year's FAA Reauthorization bill. As you know, America is currently 
facing a severe pilot shortage and there are major concerns about the 
future American pilot pipeline. Instead of raising the retirement age 
of pilots, my bill takes a different approach to combat this concerning 
pilot predicament. Overall, it directs the Secretary of Transportation 
to establish a pilot apprenticeship program at Part 141 flight schools 
around the nation, and each flight school may select up to eight 
apprentices to participate in the program each year. My bill is unique 
because it seeks provides a pathway for pilots to attend their local 
flight school, receive a quality aviation education, without limiting 
the pilot's potential aviation opportunities later in life.
    Once again, I appreciate the opportunity to present my legislative 
initiatives to the committee. I welcome any questions that you may 
have, and I appreciate the committee's consideration. Thank you.

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Anna G. Eshoo, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of California
    Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify at the Member Day hearing for the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee. As you know, Congress must pass the next 
FAA reauthorization by September 30th to ensure that the FAA can 
continue its important work to maintain the safety of the U.S. civil 
airspace. As you begin drafting this legislation, I urge you to address 
the impact of aviation noise on communities near airports.
    The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) NextGen program 
includes the use of Performance Based Navigation which allows aircraft 
to fly along more precise routes. This technology also has the 
unfortunate side effect of concentrating jet noise over communities 
under these flight paths. Since 2015, noise complaints at San Francisco 
International Airport increased by over 1,000 percent, and I continue 
to hear from so many constituents who experience elevated levels of 
noise.
    While the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 included modest 
provisions intended to address these concerns, the FAA has been slow to 
implement them, and the law has failed to provide any substantive 
relief to my constituents in the nearly five years since its passage. 
The next reauthorization must not repeat the failures of the 2018 law 
and should address its deficiencies by providing clear direction to the 
FAA to adopt policies that will actually reduce noise exposure. These 
changes should include reevaluating inadequate measures of noise to 
ensure that the FAA adopts more appropriate metrics that capture the 
true impacts of changes in flight paths to our constituents on the 
ground.
                             Noise Metrics
    The FAA relies on the 65 decibel day-night average metric (DNL) to 
measure noise impacts, but community surveys have consistently 
demonstrated that this metric significantly underestimates the negative 
impacts of aviation noise. The FAA has failed to adequately consider 
alternative metrics such as the Cumulative Noise Equivalency Level, 
which is used by the State of California, and the day-evening-night 
level metric (DENL) used in Europe.
    The next FAA reauthorization should direct the FAA to reanalyze the 
data collected in its Neighborhood Environmental Survey using 
alternative metrics such as N-Above (the number of flights exceeding a 
specified sound level) and T-Above (the amount of time a community is 
exposed to noise above a certain level). By comparing these metrics to 
the annoyance data collected in the Neighborhood Environmental Survey, 
the FAA can determine whether alternative metrics serve as better 
measures of annoyance reported by communities when compared to the 
existing DNL metric.
                   Consideration of Community Impact
    The FAA has a statutory mandate to prioritize safety and efficiency 
when designing flight paths. While safety should always be the FAA's 
top priority, efficiency should be balanced against other impacts of 
changes to flight paths, including noise. I've supported legislation to 
require the FAA to elevate the importance of noise when designing 
flight paths, including the F-AIR Act from the 117th Congress, and I 
encourage you to include this policy in the upcoming reauthorization.
    Aviation noise is not merely a nuisance. It substantially 
diminishes the quality of life of so many of my constituents, including 
many who live dozens of miles from San Francisco International Airport. 
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this hearing and for 
reviewing my testimony. I stand ready to work with you and your staff 
on the specific legislative language to implement these recommendations 
in the FAA reauthorization.

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Ron Estes, a Representative in Congress From 
                          the State of Kansas
    Mr. Chairman,
    Thank you for the opportunity to come before the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee today to share my priorities as the Committee 
works toward reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration 
this year. Kansas' 4th Congressional District is home to the Air 
Capital of the World, so I've had a chance to hear many ideas from 
across the industry about ways to continue to improve the FAA.
                 Section 625 Aviation Workforce Grants
    Workforce issues facing the aviation industry are among our 
greatest challenges. There are workforce shortages across the sector--
from pilots to aviation maintenance technicians to aviation 
manufacturing professionals. These jobs are highly skilled and in high 
demand across the nation. One way that the FAA has worked to address 
this is through their Section 625 Aviation Workforce Grant programs. 
These programs currently support grants to increase interest in and 
prepare students to pursue careers as pilots and aviation maintenance 
technical workers.
    These programs are essential but vastly oversubscribed. Over $120 
million in grant funds was requested across all applicants for this 
program, with a maximum total of only $10 million able to be disbursed. 
Only 23 applicants received grant awards. This demonstrates the 
pressing need to reauthorize this program at a level more commensurate 
with demand.
    I urge reauthorization of the Section 625 aviation workforce 
programs, increasing the authorized funding, and expanding the program 
eligibility to encompass workforce development activities specifically 
for aviation manufacturing.
     Airline Service for Smaller Communities Using Part 23 Aircraft
    I also recommend updating the existing FAA regulations to allow 
newer Part 23 aircraft to operate Part 121 scheduled service. The 
current FAA regulations do not allow for small aircraft certified after 
1996 under Part 23 that carry up to 19 passengers to participate in 
Part 121 scheduled operations. While the same older, less safe, pre-
1996 aircraft were grandfathered in, current regulations prevent 
upgraded and safer aircraft versions from operating Part 121 scheduled 
service.
    There is a range of possible benefits associated with modifying 
this regulation to allow these upgraded small aircraft with the latest 
technology modernizations to operate in accordance with all other 
applicable FAA regulations governing scheduled airline service (14 CFR 
Part 121). This includes enhanced aviation safety, improved access to 
and options for air service to smaller and rural communities to close 
service gaps, development of new, innovative small aircraft, and 
elimination of the competitive disadvantage for U.S. carriers by 
aligning with international standards.
                     Aircraft Certification Service
    The FAA's Aircraft Certification Service (AIR) is the foundation 
for oversight over the design, production, airworthiness certification, 
and continued airworthiness programs for all U.S. civil aviation 
products and foreign import products.
    As the FAA reauthorization process continues, a specific focus on 
the effectiveness and efficiency of regional Aircraft Certification 
Offices (ACOs) and the International Validation Branch (AIR-730) is 
necessary to facilitate safety, innovation, and U.S. global leadership 
in aviation. Both offices support critical safety reviews of products 
and technologies, which is essential to the U.S. maintaining the gold 
standard of aviation safety and innovation.
                    Regulatory Process Improvements
    Recent trends at the FAA indicate that administrative delays in the 
promulgation of consultative rulemaking, policies, and guidance are 
major limiting factors in advancing safety-enhancing products through 
the certification process. Moreover, the FAA maintains a vast backlog 
of technical standards, policy memos, orders, and advisory circulars. 
Administrative delays are inhibiting valuable innovation and safety 
improvements across the sector.
    To improve the FAA processes for developing safety standards across 
various safety functions, I recommend including in FAA Reauthorization 
a requirement for the FAA to conduct a comprehensive review of their 
regulatory processes and report findings to appropriate committees of 
jurisdiction. This should include specific recommendations to improve 
timeliness, transparency, and performance accountability in 
promulgating rules, regulatory policies, guidance, and other materials.
            Future State of FAA Product Certification Study
    New entrants to the aviation industry are ushering in a new era of 
innovation and safety. Supporting American aviation innovation is 
critical to maintaining our global leadership position in this arena. 
In order to preserve our gold standard, we must consider how advanced 
computing will play a role for future FAA engineers. Other factors, 
such as digital and modeling requirements, new procedures, and a 
greater need for accurate and timely presentation of data, should be 
considered as the FAA moves into a new era of product certification.
    I recommend that FAA Reauthorization feature a requirement for the 
FAA to conduct an independent study on a future state on type 
certification processes. The FAA should utilize an appropriate 
federally funded R&D center, or other independent nonprofit 
organization with aviation policy expertise, to identify digital and 
modeling requirements, and necessary policies, procedures, and vision, 
to improve the safety and innovation of aircraft certification 
activities in the future.

                                 * * *

    Mr. Chairman, thank you again for allowing me to share my thoughts 
on FAA reauthorization. It is invaluable to have an opportunity to 
communicate these priorities from our constituents. I appreciate your 
consideration of these items as the Committee continues to work under 
your steadfast leadership to pass an FAA Reauthorization in the 
upcoming months.

                                 
    Prepared Statement of Hon. Lizzie Fletcher, a Representative in 
                    Congress From the State of Texas
    I appreciate the opportunity to testify about priorities for the 
reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that will 
support economic growth and airport service in my community, expand and 
support our aviation workforce, and ensure the safe integration of new 
airspace technologies.
                  Economic Growth and Airport Service
    The Sugar Land Regional Airport, located in Texas' Seventh 
Congressional District, is a valued community partner that provides 
general aviation service, serves as a reliever airport for George Bush 
Intercontinental Airport and Hobby Airport, and plays an important role 
in coordinating regional disaster relief and recovery.
    It is also one of 262 airports around the country that is able to 
provide commercial and emergency service because of the FAA Contract 
Tower Program. This program is crucial to maintaining air traffic 
services at airports that might otherwise not have control tower 
staffing. Currently, this program receives funding on an annual basis, 
creating operational uncertainty for airports like the Sugar Land 
Regional Airport which relies on this program to carry out its work.
    I request that the FAA Reauthorization of 2023 permit multi-year 
expenditure authority for this important program. This request will 
support the aviation needs of communities around the country and propel 
economic development and investment for their residents.
                           Aviation Workforce
    Although the U.S. airline industry currently employs more workers 
than it employed before the COVID-19 pandemic, certain aviation workers 
are struggling to maintain baseline staffing numbers. These staffing 
problems threaten our domestic industries and jeopardize air safety.
    I support the expansion of the Aviation Workforce Development Grant 
program, an important tool to prepare the next generation of pilots and 
aviation maintenance technicians. For Fiscal Year 2023, $10 million in 
grants will support 23 programs across the country. I ask the Committee 
to (1) increase the authorized funding level for this program and (2) 
expand its eligibility requirements to include rotary-wing aircraft 
industry. The rotary-wing industry is experiencing similar staffing 
issues to the fixed-wing industry, impacting its unique usage in 
disaster recovery, search and rescue, medical transportation, and law 
enforcement. In Texas and along the Gulf Coast, rotary-wing aircraft 
also play important roles in supporting offshore energy production. As 
we work to secure domestic energy production and expand our offshore 
energy capabilities to include wind and solar, we will need a reliable 
talent pipeline for rotary-wing aircraft.
    In the last decade, the number of air traffic controllers has 
dropped ten percent. This shortage threatens the safety of our current 
aviation system and impacts flight availability around the country. I 
request that the Committee ensure the FAA has the resources to continue 
their focus on increasing this important workforce.
                       New Airspace Technologies
    Looking to the future, we must ensure we are investing in the 
talent pipeline that will support new aviation technologies, including 
Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). AAM aircraft can support a variety of 
different services, including regional passenger operations, air cargo 
deliveries, and public service operations such as police, fire, and 
medical services. Currently, only former military pilots have access to 
the training required to pilot an AAM aircraft, limiting the civilian 
pilot pool to less than 400 nationwide. Without an accessible path for 
a civilian pilot to obtain the necessary certification to fly AAM 
aircraft, the American aviation industry will be delayed in adopting 
these new technologies, including electric AAM aircraft that will 
reduce emissions and achieve a more sustainable industry. I request the 
Committee authorize a clear pathway at the FAA for civilian pilots to 
obtain a powered lift certificate, including through issuing an FAA 
Special Federal Aviation Regulation.
    Last, we must ensure that the FAA supports the hard infrastructure 
that these innovative airspace technologies will require. I am glad 
last year's government funding bill authorized an AAM planning grant 
program. As state, local, and tribal governments use these planning 
grants to prepare for the integration of AAM, I request the Committee 
authorize AAM construction funding to make the needed adjustments at 
existing airports for AAM takeoff and landing, including supporting 
electric AAM aircraft and their charging needs.
    Authorizing these priorities will support our aviation industry and 
workforce and prepare the United States for the next generation of air 
service technologies. Thank you for your consideration of these 
important requests. I look forward to working with the Committee on 
these priorities and much more.

                                 
    Prepared Statement of Hon. Pramila Jayapal, a Representative in 
                 Congress From the State of Washington
    Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen:
    On behalf of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, I thank you for 
extending the opportunity to members of Congress to provide input on 
policy priorities for the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation 
Administration. Among the legislative goals critical to advance in the 
FAA reauthorization, I am pleased to share a non-exhaustive list of key 
priorities for the over 100 members of our caucus:
    Include the Good Jobs for Good Airports Act (H.R. 1499), which 
would establish a minimum wage and benefit standard for airport service 
workers at large, medium, and small hub airports. It would also:
      Extend prevailing wage requirements to federal 
investments in airport infrastructure for airport service workers, 
similar to the prevailing wage requirements that have long been 
required under the Davis-Bacon Act and related acts for federally-
funded infrastructure construction projects.
      Require commercial airport recipients of federal 
assistance to certify they will ensure the airport service workers at 
that airport are paid no less than the wages and benefits required 
under the Service Contract Act (SCA) or no less than a local minimum 
wage that is higher than the wage and benefits under the SCA.

    Include the Airline Passengers' Bill of Rights (S. 178) and the 
Forbidding Airlines from Imposing Ridiculous Fees Act (H.R. 659), which 
would provide passengers with fair compensation, refunds, and recourse 
in the event of airline-caused flight delays and cancellations, require 
airlines to pay at least $1,350 to passengers denied boarding as a 
result of an oversold flight, and mandate airlines to immediately 
refund bag fees for damaged or lost bags.
    Include the Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations Act (H.R. 1233), 
which codifies the Department of Transportation's (DOT) authority to 
require major airlines to give passengers a cash refund if the airline 
cancels or significantly delays their flight, and creates a new right 
for consumers to receive a cash refund if the passenger cancels their 
flight up to 48 hours ahead of the flight's scheduled departure.
    Codify the Administration's efforts to crack down on junk fees by 
incorporating Families Fly Together Act (S. 525) into the 
reauthorization. This will ensure in statute that a child can sit next 
to a family member on a flight at no additional cost.
    Incorporate the Fair and Open Skies Act (H.R. 3095 in the 117th 
Congress) to prevent new foreign airlines from exploiting ``flags of 
convenience,'' wherein a company sites its operations in a country with 
weak labor standards and safety regulations rather than its country of 
origin in order gain an unfair competitive advantage in the market.
    Increase competition, consumer choice and quality by inserting 
language reforming airports' slotting systems and improving gate access 
for smaller carriers. This will prevent larger airlines from hoarding 
limited capacity of slots at major airports to deny entry by lower-cost 
airlines. Legislative language should direct the FAA to adopt 
approaches that open more slots to bidding by all airlines, requiring 
airlines to either make efficient use of the slots or give them up, and 
prevent private, anti-competitive trading of slots.
    Reaffirm the existing enforcement powers of the Department of 
Transportation to crack down on airline misconduct. Congress should use 
the FAA reauthorization to clarify that canceling flights due to 
insufficient staffing represents an unfair and deceptive practice, and 
that the Department of Transportation should use its full authority to 
fine airlines for malfeasance and failing to offer refunds to 
passengers for canceled flights in order to deter future abuses.
    Include the Cabin Air Safety Act (H.R. 1293) to protect airline 
pilots, flight attendants, and passengers from toxic cabin air. The 
legislation would establish air quality standards and assist with the 
monitoring, reporting, and investigating of these ``toxic fume'' 
events.
    Prevent federal preemption of state and local labor standards. We 
ask that the Committee not include any language that would attempt to 
limit or prohibit states and localities from including airline workers 
in labor protections extended to other workforces.
    Support zero-emission ground vehicles and infrastructure at 
airports. Dedicate funding in this reauthorization to complete 
comprehensive ground-fleet transition plans for airports across the 
country and provide dedicated funding to adopt zero-emission vehicles 
and supporting infrastructure at airports, including through enhancing 
and expanding the Voluntary Low Emissions Program (VALE) and the Zero 
Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) Infrastructure Pilot Program.
    Eliminate federal preemption that prohibits state courts, state 
attorneys general, and state legislatures and passengers from pursuing 
claims and legal recourse for wrongdoing or misconduct in the airline 
industry. Include legislative language to end preemption for states 
seeking to enact or enforce laws related to an air carrier's prices, 
routes, or service; provide the U.S. attorney general with authority to 
enforce relevant airline commerce and safety regulations without the 
request of the Secretary of Transportation; provide state attorneys 
general with authority to enforce relevant airline commerce and safety 
regulations, and restore a private right of action for relevant airline 
commerce and safety regulations, including setting forth penalties in 
such cases.
    Transition to fluorine-free firefighting foam by quickly outlining 
a national transition plan. While the FAA removed the formal 
requirement that firefighting foams contain per- and polyfluoroalkyl 
substances (PFAS), it has not yet been able to provide airports with an 
FAA-approved fluorine-free alternative. This plan should include 
factors such as implementation plans for obtaining approved products, 
acceptable environmental limits of PFAS, and best practices for 
decontamination of existing equipment used to deploy foams.
    Require all airlines to submit employee assault prevention and 
response plans that include airport workers such as ticket agents. 
Apply civil penalties for those air carriers that fail to develop and 
submit a plan.
    Include legislative language to expand key workplace protections 
for nursing mothers, including reasonable break time to nurse and a 
private place to pump, for all flight attendants and pilots.
    Strengthen ``Buy America'' provisions related to federally funded 
airport improvement projects. Congress should include language in the 
FAA reauthorization to ensure that ``Buy America'' requirements for 
FAA-funded projects also include iron and construction materials, not 
just ``steel and manufactured goods'' as under current law.
    Include the Global Aircraft Maintenance Safety Improvement Act 
(H.R. 7321 in the 117th Congress) as passed by the House last Congress, 
to uphold America's leadership in aviation safety by improving safety 
standards and oversight of foreign aircraft repair stations used by 
many domestic carriers.
    Include legislative language to limit the practice of stock 
buybacks, whereby companies artificially boost the value of their 
shares, among aviation firms receiving federal subsidies.
    Require all FAA contractors to remain neutral in union organizing 
campaigns, narrow the gap between CEO and worker pay, have no major 
violations of labor rights or environmental protection laws on record, 
and divulge political activities and contributions, parties or third-
party political groups in the past two years.
    Thank you for your leadership and consideration. We look forward to 
working with you to advance these commonsense and long-overdue policy 
goals through the FAA reauthorization process.

                                 
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Marcy Kaptur, a Representative in Congress 
                         From the State of Ohio
    Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and Members of the 
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on the 
economic development and aviation legislative priorities that I 
encourage the Committee to consider this year.
    I urge the Committee to support critical federal investments in 
regional economic development by reauthorizing the Economic Development 
Administration, the federal regional economic development commissions, 
and the Great Lakes Authority. The Economic Development Administration 
has been operating without congressional authorization since 2008 and 
the authorizations of appropriations for the Southeast Crescent 
Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission, the 
Northern Border Regional Commission, and the Great Lakes Authority 
expire this fiscal year. The Northern Great Plains Regional Authority's 
authorization of appropriations lapsed in 2018; it has not received 
funding since 2004. And the Delta Regional Authority's authority to 
operate will sunset on October 1, 2023 unless amendatory legislation is 
enacted. Supporting regional economic development is crucial to ensure 
that the United States remains a global leader. My region in the Great 
Lakes, for example, contains the core of the United States' commercial 
and defense industrial base, as well as the largest system of 
accessible surface freshwater in the world. The Great Lakes supply 
drinking water for more than 30 million Americans, support over 1.5 
million jobs that generate $62 billion in wages each year, and provide 
habitat for over 3,500 species of plants and animals. At the same time, 
the Great Lakes Region has struggled with job loss, underinvestment, 
deindustrialization, invasive species, toxic chemical contamination, 
habitat loss, coastal erosion, and beach closures.
    In order to tackle the significant regional economic and 
environmental challenges facing Great Lakes watershed communities in 
the eight states of Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, 
Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and New York, we must empower the Great Lakes 
Authority to identify and advance regional solutions. Establishing a 
revolving fund for grants and loans and vesting the Great Lakes 
Authority with financing powers will allow the Great Lakes Authority to 
sustain investments in the larger and more complex projects that are 
critical to regional economic development, without compromising the 
provision of traditional assistance to local development districts. And 
because these powers will ultimately reduce the Authority's reliance on 
appropriations, the federal taxpayer will also benefit from an updated 
reauthorization of the Great Lakes Authority.
    In addition, I encourage the Committee to include provisions in the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Bill to address 
challenges facing small community airports. These airports can be 
tremendous drivers of local and regional economic development, 
attracting investment and generating good-paying jobs by connecting 
people and businesses to the global air transportation system. Despite 
the numerous economic challenges facing small community airports due to 
the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and workforce shortages, they 
continue to find creative ways to persevere. The Committee can help 
these airports pivot, survive and, ultimately, flourish by considering 
the following measures, among others: (1) removing the $20 million cap 
on the amount of discretionary funds allowed in terminal projects at 
non-hub airports under the Airport Improvement Program (AIP); (2) 
modernizing the general aviation entitlements under the AIP by 
increasing funding levels for airports with more activity; (3) 
increasing the authorization of appropriations for the Small Community 
Air Service Development Program; (4) extending and increasing funding 
for Aviation Workforce Development grants; and (5) directing the FAA to 
increase the efficiency of its grant award processes and to provide 
greater deference to airport sponsors on the application of federal 
funds to eligible activities.
    Further, I support empowering the FAA to consider the economic 
development goals of the local communities served by small airports 
when rendering decisions on small community airport development plans. 
I urge the Committee to enhance the FAA's discretion to modify airport 
grant assurances when doing so will provide clear economic benefits to 
the local or regional economy while avoiding appreciable impacts to 
civil aviation.
    Finally, I encourage the Committee to enhance the FAA's authority 
to help airports become more resilient and sustainable in the face of 
extreme weather events and ever-increasing threats to our nation's 
energy independence. More than ever, airports across the country need 
federal assistance to adapt to extreme weather events and to increase 
reliance on domestic alternative energy and fuel sources. I support 
dedicated funding for programs for resilient and sustainable 
infrastructure, emissions reduction, and energy efficiency at airports.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and thank you for 
the work you do in service to the American people.

                                 
  Prepared Statement of Hon. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Representative in 
                  Congress From the State of Illinois
    Thank you, Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, for the 
opportunity to participate in this hearing. My statement today focuses 
on the projected increased rail activity in my district and the adverse 
effects it will have on the surrounding communities.
    The Surface Transportation Board (STB) recently approved the merger 
of our country's sixth and seventh largest railroads--Canadian Pacific 
(CP) and Kansas City Southern (KCS). The largest metropolitan area in 
the country affected by this merger will be the Chicago area, and the 
area of Chicagoland most affected by the merger will be the towns and 
cities on the Milwaukee District West (MDW) line, a central corridor 
line that runs through the heavily populated suburban communities from 
Bensenville to Elgin, Illinois. These towns and villages, comprising 
hundreds of thousands of people, lie almost entirely within my 
congressional district (IL-08).
    This merger will at a minimum quadruple freight train traffic along 
the MDW line--from three to eleven freight trains.\1\ Multiple 
stakeholders--including Metra, Canadian National, and a coalition of 
communities in my district--have heavily disputed CP's train count 
projections and believe that the merger would actually increase freight 
traffic from three to eighteen daily trains.\2\ These dramatic 
increases in freight traffic would have significant impacts on one of 
the most important transportation hubs in the country, including 
increased delays of local emergency responders, more frequent commuter 
rail interruptions, and a higher risk of hazardous material spills.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Under the ICC Termination Act, which created the STB, the board may 
approve a merger if it finds that it is in ``the public interest.'' \3\ 
Despite my efforts with Senators Durbin and Duckworth, and other 
members of the Illinois delegation in raising voicing of our concerns 
and opposition of the merger as proposed, the STB has decided to accept 
CP's data and find that this merger is in ``the public interest,'' even 
with impacts on emergency responders, commuter rail, and the 
environment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    For these reasons, and the reasons outlined below, I respectfully 
request that the T&I Committee consider legislative fixes that would 
authorize increased scrutiny from the STB of future proposed merger's 
local impacts, including on local public safety, emergency services, 
and public transportation in heavily populated areas.
    Currently, the three freight trains traveling the MDW line already 
cause delays for emergency vehicles because freight trains--which 
average 10,000 feet in length--are long enough to block all the 
crossings in some communities simultaneously, including each of the 
four crossings in Itasca.\4\ Forcing responders to take lengthy 
alternate routes, these blockages prevent emergency responders from 
reaching emergencies in a timely fashion. According to Wood Dale's Fire 
Chief, freight trains cause delays to ``double, and in some cases 
triple, both response times and travel distances to the farthest points 
in any response area.'' \5\ And, according to Itasca's Fire Chief, if a 
freight train blocks the crossings in Itasca, a response that normally 
takes 1 minute and 15 seconds, would take 14 minutes.\6\ These drastic 
delays put people's lives and homes at immediate risk in times of 
crisis. 60% of the nearly 13,000 emergency calls to the Itasca Police 
over the last two years were from the opposite side of the tracks from 
where the department is located.\7\ Between Elgin and Bensenville 
alone, there are 54 crossings over approximately 20 miles of track,\8\ 
which emergency responders frequently use to reach emergencies. 
Increasing the freight traffic going through these communities by at 
least eight additional daily trains will dramatically increase the 
frequency of delays that our emergency responders currently face to an 
intolerable level.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unfortunately, the impact of these delays extends further than 
emergency vehicles. Metra, the signature commuter rail system for 
Chicagoland residents, could similarly face setbacks as a result of the 
merger. CP's three freight trains that run on Metra's MDW and Milwaukee 
District-North lines already cause frequent Metra commuter train 
delays, and additional freight trains would significantly worsen these 
delays. According to Metra, CP, which has dispatching rights on Metra's 
lines, regularly violates its contractual obligation to allow Metra to 
operate during specified windows of time by giving preference to 
freight rail over Metra trains.\9\ These violations lead to Metra 
commuter delays of over 20 minutes, even during peak periods.\10\ 
During the review of the proposed merger, Metra suggested that the 
merger would cause an almost 300% increase in delays, which would 
``break'' its system.\11\ These additional delays potentially encourage 
hundreds of thousands of commuters to drive rather than take Metra 
trains, clogging our roads, harming the environment, and setting back 
public transit for decades.

    In addition, increased rail traffic puts communities at greater 
risk of derailments and hazardous spills--and the United States has 
seen the damaging impacts of multiple recent derailments. In February, 
Norfolk Southern Railroad cars derailed near East Palestine, Ohio, 
causing a hazardous spill that has contaminated at least 15,000 pounds 
of soil and 1.1 million gallons of water.\12\ On March 30, another 
train derailment of twenty-two freight rail cars carrying multiple 
substances, including ethanol, caused a mass evacuation of nearby 
residents in Raymond, Minnesota.\13\ Four of the cars carrying ethanol, 
caught fire and continued to burn for more than 14 hours, putting 
people at risk of severe headaches, nausea, and sickness.\14\ \15\

    On March 26, multiple freight cars of a CP train derailed on 
Metra's MD-W line in Franklin Park, Illinois--the very line that CP 
trains operate on in suburban Chicago.\16\ Luckily, no hazardous 
materials were released in Franklin Park; however, the approved merger 
between CP and KCS is expected to bring almost 11,000 additional 
carloads of hazardous materials per year through my district's 
communities, putting them at greater risk of a potential spill.\17\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Though the STB's final decision includes an unprecedented seven-
year oversight period to monitor Metra operations and public safety, I 
believe that greater scrutiny should be given regarding a proposed 
merger's impacts on local communities, and therefore local economies 
and livelihood, during the STB's review process. I urge this committee 
to prioritize the safety and well-being of our communities, including 
the investments that we have put in improving public transit, and I 
urge you to consider legislation that will ensure these concerns are 
considered more thoroughly in future reviews of mergers.
    As our nation contends with some of the most serious questions of 
railway safety raised in generations, I fear that decisions increasing 
train traffic through my communities will similarly lead what has 
happened in East Palestine and Raymond to happen in Elgin or Roselle.

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Ann M. Kuster, a Representative in Congress 
                    From the State of New Hampshire
    Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
    I want to begin by thanking you for holding today's Member Day. I 
appreciate this opportunity to present the priorities of New 
Hampshire's 2nd District. My statement today focuses on priorities for 
the upcoming Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act, 
which is set to expire later this year.
                         Essential Air Service
    Rural and small communities depend on commercial air service out of 
small, local airports like the Lebanon Municipal Airport in my district 
in New Hampshire. This airport provides connections to Boston Logan and 
New York City via White Plains, enabling Granite Staters to travel for 
business or pleasure and encouraging tourism to stimulate our local 
economy. However, service from this airport would not be possible 
without the Essential Air Service (EAS) program which subsidizes these 
flights that would otherwise be cost-prohibitive.
    EAS is a vital safety net to connect communities to over 170 
airports in 36 states and ensure that they maintain access to a minimum 
level of commercial air service. Without this program, many of these 
communities would lack access to commercial air service. I ask that the 
Committee continue its record of support for the Essential Air Service 
program and extend this program in a forthcoming FAA Reauthorization 
bill.
                     Solar-Powered Lighting Systems
    As this Committee works to sustain our nation's airports, I ask 
that you also consider opportunities to integrate new innovative 
technologies to provide airports cost-savings and strengthen their 
resiliency. Currently, the majority of publicly-owned airport across 
the country use conventional hardwired lighting systems connected to 
the power grid for lighting. However, major airports such as Orlando, 
LAX, JFK, and O'Hare have purchased and installed solar-powered 
airfield lighting systems that are more energy-efficient, cost-
effective, and can withstand power outages, all while providing 
equivalent performance.
    Despite their demonstrated success, solar-powered lighting systems 
have yet to receive full approval by the FAA making them ineligible for 
Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funding and cost-prohibitive to many 
smaller airports.
    I ask that the Committee request that the FAA produce an 
engineering brief describing the acceptable use of permanent solar 
powered lighting systems for airports across the country. This would 
provide needed guidance for airport authorities to evaluate these 
systems and reap the same benefits afforded to major airports.
                             5G Deployment
    As a co-chair of the bipartisan 5G and Beyond Caucus, I am 
committed to ensuring that next-generation, wireless communication 
technology can be deployed nation-wide. Expanding access to wireless 
services will allow consumers in urban and rural communities to connect 
to faster networks and promote the innovation of future technologies. 
Most importantly, these networks will help to close the digital divide 
by connecting to hard-to-reach areas, like those that exist across New 
Hampshire.
    As 5G deployment begins to accelerate, the FAA has raised concerns 
about the potential for networks near airports to interfere with 
critical safety equipment on aircrafts. I remain committed to the 
safety of my constituents and to ensuring that 5G can be deployed 
safely to all communities. I commend the industry for engaging in 
voluntary agreements with the FAA to ensure that the deployment of 5G 
technologies can continue without disruption to our aviation system. It 
is critical that the Committee ensures the FAA is empowered to develop 
future agreements as additional companies look to deploy 5G networks. I 
also ask that the Committee works to support airlines to upgrade 
equipment to avoid future interference.
    I appreciate the Committee's consideration of the priorities of New 
Hampshire's 2nd Congressional District. I look forward to working with 
the Committee to ensure that small, rural communities remain a focus in 
the development of the next FAA Reauthorization legislation.

                                 
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Zoe Lofgren, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of California
    Thank you, Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, for this 
opportunity to submit testimony on my priority issues for FAA 
Reauthorization.
    I have been actively engaged in the Reauthorization of the Federal 
Aviation Administration's (FAA) research and development activities as 
part of my work on the Committee on Science, Space and Technology, 
where I am Ranking Member. We recently held a hearing in preparation 
for our Committee's work on the R&D title that will contribute to this 
Committee's FAA Reauthorization legislation. During that hearing, I 
spoke about the urgency of addressing leaded aviation fuels, because 
what we know now is that this is a dangerous public health crisis that 
is affecting my constituents in California's 18th congressional 
district.
    Leaded fuels have been out of the engines of cars and trucks for 
more than 25 years, but leaded aviation gasoline (avgas) is still the 
primary fuel used in the piston-engine planes and helicopters that are 
the dominant aircraft of the General Aviation sector. In fact, general 
aviation is the leading source of airborne lead emissions in this 
country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has 
concluded that there is no known safe level of lead in the blood for 
human health, and lead exposure can be especially harmful to childhood 
development. The greatest impacts of lead emissions in the air and 
deposits on surfaces and in the soil are felt by general aviation 
airport workers and the communities surrounding general aviation 
airports around the country.
    In California's 18th District, there is a small general aviation 
airport in East San Jose, the Reid-Hillview Airport (RHV). In 2021, the 
County of Santa Clara (the County) commissioned a study of the blood 
lead levels of children surrounding RHV. The authors of that study 
reported that they found systematically elevated lead in the blood of 
those children, and the levels rose in correlation with proximity to 
the airport. During periods of high piston-engine aircraft traffic, the 
study reported that children near Reid-Hillview Airport experienced an 
increase in blood lead levels that exceeded that of what the children 
in Flint, Michigan, experienced during that water crisis.\1\

documents/RHV-Airborne-Lead-Study-Report.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In response to these findings and ongoing calls from the community 
to address the issue, the County voted to ban the sale of leaded avgas. 
After the County stopped offering leaded fuel at RHV the FAA actually 
threatened to sue them to force sale of the same leaded avgas that was 
shown to be poisoning children living near RHV. I and my colleagues 
representing neighboring districts in the County have been working on 
this issue with the Secretary of Transportation and the President. 
Through our efforts an agreement was recently reached that pauses the 
FAA's legal action while a framework for airports to transition to 
unleaded fuel is studied, allowing a pilot project through which the 
County can dispense only unleaded fuel at RHV and another small airport 
in the County. This is just a temporary fix to a longstanding and 
serious problem.
    We need to reach a permanent solution to the problem of leaded 
avgas. The FAA has been carrying out R&D toward achieving unleaded 
avgas for many years pursuant to Congressional direction provided 
through the Science, Space, and Technology Committee's work on the R&D 
titles of FAA reauthorizations. The 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform 
Act included direction for FAA to work with NASA on the qualification 
of an unleaded fuel. The 2012 Act also directed, that the FAA should, 
``at a minimum,'' develop an R&D plan with specific objectives, assess 
methods and processes for expeditious certification and approvals, 
assess technologies to modify existing aircraft for safe operation 
using unleaded fuels, and develop recommendations for appropriate 
policies and guidelines to facilitate a transition to unleaded avgas. 
In 2014, FAA established the Piston Engine Aviation Fuels Initiative 
(PAFI) to support the testing and evaluation of unleaded fuel 
candidates, with a goal of eventually identifying at least one unleaded 
fuel that could widely replace leaded avgas by 2018, which was 
obviously not achieved.
    As of 2022, only two candidate 100-octane unleaded fuels, from two 
different fuel developers, were being tested at FAA, and neither had 
yet formally entered the PAFI program for full evaluation.\2\

PAFI_%20Background%20and%20Program
%20Updates.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In 2022, the FAA announced a new government-industry partnership, 
the Eliminate Aviation Gasoline Lead Emissions (EAGLE) initiative, with 
a goal of a ``transition to lead-free aviation fuels for piston-engine 
aircraft by the end of 2030, without compromising safety or economic 
health of the general aviation industry.'' While I'm pleased the FAA is 
taking further action to address the avgas issue, 2030 is not a 
timeline commensurate with the urgency of protecting the health of 
children, the workers at general aviation airports, and the communities 
exposed to leaded aviation fuel.
    In this year's FAA reauthorization and the Science Committee's work 
on the FAA R&D title, I will be looking at ways to further R&D toward a 
solution. I will be looking at ways to advance the FAA's relevant work 
on development, testing, standards development, and certification 
activities in the interest of identifying and widely deploying an 
alternative to leaded avgas for piston-engine aircraft at the earliest 
possible date. I also want to explore the testing and evaluation 
efforts of the FAA R&D enterprise going on now, including those 
conducted as part of the new EAGLE initiative, and identify ways to 
support and advance the work. Further, I want to examine options for 
eliminating the barriers that have stalled progress in this area for so 
long.
    It is my hope that my work to prioritize this issue in the Science 
Committee will complement efforts by your Committee to make the 
transition away from leaded avgas a reality for our country as soon as 
possible. To support these efforts, I request that the FAA 
Reauthorization streamline the certification process for unleaded fuel, 
as it is currently lengthy and complex. To ease the cost burden 
associated with transitioning to and deploying unleaded avgas, I urge 
the Committee to prioritize incentives for deploying unleaded avgas. 
Tax incentives should be offered for private sector companies who 
choose to enter the unleaded avgas market. And, for airports who choose 
to make the transition to unleaded, I ask that the FAA Reauthorization 
include grant eligibilities, whether these come in the form of 
expanding current grant eligibilities or by establishing new grants, 
for the infrastructure demands associated with this transition, 
including but not limited to the purchase and installation of new and 
additional fuel tanks.
    In addition to the disincentives posed by the lengthy and complex 
certification process and the costs associated with deploying unleaded 
avgas, another impediment to this transition is uncertainty and a lack 
of information surrounding unleaded avgas. I urge the Committee to 
direct FAA to issue guidance regarding the benefits and safety of 
unleaded avgas, as well as information for airports that clarifies best 
practices for deploying unleaded avgas. I also request that the FAA 
hold information sessions on this topic for stakeholders, including 
pilots and airport officials.
    It cannot be left to individual airports to transition away from 
leaded avgas--there must be a nationwide mandate as soon as possible. A 
patchwork of bans on leaded avgas will allow pilots to continue fueling 
up where leaded avgas is still available and landing and taking off 
from those communities that have opted to put their health and safety 
first.
    It is also important to note that only does the continued use of 
leaded avgas pose a serious public health problem, but it is also an 
environmental justice issue. Leaded avgas disproportionately impacts 
low-income and minority communities, which are more likely to be found 
in close proximity to airports, like the East San Jose community 
surrounding RHV in my district. These communities are also often the 
most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which is exacerbated 
by the use of leaded avgas. With what we know about the negative health 
and environmental impact of leaded avgas, failing to end the use of 
leaded avgas sends the message that the health and safety of these 
communities is not a priority.
    I would also like to take this opportunity to advocate for 
inclusion of language in the upcoming FAA Reauthorization that would 
assist with the closure of RHV. Along with voting to ban the sale of 
leaded avgas, in 2021, the County responded to strong, decades-long 
calls from the community by voting to fast-track closure of the 
airport. As noted previously, RHV is in close proximity to residential 
neighborhoods and has become increasingly incompatible with the 
surrounding community. The airport has been the source of numerous 
noise complaints from local residents and has been the subject of 
numerous safety concerns due to its close proximity to residential 
areas, including airplane crashes near homes. There has been an 
increasing demand by local residents for the land that RHV is currently 
situated on to be repurposed to better serve this low-income, majority 
minority community, such as to increase housing supply and for 
recreational open space for the residents. I ask that language similar 
to what was included in the 2005 FAA Reauthorization for the closure of 
the Rialto Municipal Airport be included with regards to closure of 
RHV. This would include language to assist the County with buyback of 
lands where the airport is located and assistance with repayment of 
federal grants.
    I thank the Committee for providing me the opportunity to provide 
testimony and look forward to working with you on the pressing issue of 
ending the use leaded avgas in the United States.

                                 
   Prepared Statement of Hon. Stephen F. Lynch, a Representative in 
            Congress From the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
    Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
    As the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee welcome input on 
this Member's Day on a variety of topics of the upcoming year, I 
respectfully submit comment on the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) Reauthorization, Pipeline Safety (PHSMA) Reauthorization, and 
Coast Guard Reauthorization.
    As the committee reviews the FAA Reauthorization for 2023, I would 
like to emphasize the following priorities for the bill and the 
aviation sector.
    Safety has and always will be the priority when viewing any 
transportation industry. From our nation being secure against outside 
threats, passengers travelling safely to and from Boston, constituents 
being protected from loud planes, and the hard-working staff having the 
protections needed to feel comfortable in their profession, safety is 
the focal point when viewing aviation. I know the Secretary of 
Transportation, the Honorable Pete Buttigieg, shares these views and I 
hope they are reflected in this upcoming reauthorization bill.
    I want to highlight a common theme in my priorities, aircraft 
noise. As Co-chair of the Quiet Skies Caucus, we know that aircraft 
noise is a pain that plagues many Americans and is not only a nuisance 
but as a health risk. Sleepless nights, anxiety, and headaches are all 
symptoms experienced by excessive noise. Many of these policies will 
hope to address this--whether it is better studying the current 
situation or including better reporting systems. The FAA has the 
responsibility to serve both the aviation industry and the everyday 
Americans who are harmed by collateral impacts of the aviation 
industry.
    I ask that the following bills and policies be included in the 
Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization of 2023. In order of 
importance:
    1.  Civil Aviation Security and Safety Act, H.R. 1187
      a.  This bill will modify the requirements for the registration 
of certain aircraft. It will also give the FAA the power to enact and 
issue fees associated with unregistered aircrafts.
      b.  By creating an Aircraft Registry Taskforce which will examine 
national security, law enforcement, and public safety issues related to 
civil aircraft registration, this taskforce will develop solutions to 
mitigate security and safety risks and increase inter-agency 
cooperation.
    2.  Over-The-Water Landings and Departures for Large Commercial 
Airlines
      a.  As a solution for excessive aircraft noise for communities, 
an alternative would be to prioritize over-the-water landings and 
departures when safe and available.
      b.  We ask that the FAA implement instructions to prioritize for 
flying over-the-water to ensure that the noise will be focused away 
from our populated communities. The positive impacts of decreasing 
noise would be great as shown by RNAV studies and the safety of the 
flights is not changed.
    3.  Airport Improvement Programs (AIP Funding)
      a.  The AIP provides funds to public use airports to help improve 
safety and efficiency. AIP can be used to help airports expand or 
reconstruct terminals to accommodate security-screening checkpoints and 
improve passenger flow through the airport. As passenger drop-off and 
pick-up behavior changes, AIP could help airports make facility 
improvements to better manage traffic and improve safety along the curb 
in front of the terminal. There are also dedicated funding buckets for 
Noise and Air Emission mitigation.
      b.  We support increasing the funding level to a minimum of $4 
billion annually. Additionally, we support authorizing supplemental 
discretionary AIP funding and allowing airports to use funds for more 
terminal projects and other PFC-eligible projects.
    4.  Air Traffic Noise and Pollution Expert Consensus Act, H.R. 2562
      a.  This legislation I introduced will require the FAA 
Administrator to sponsor an Expert Consensus Report from the Health 
Division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and 
Medicine. Under the bill, the National Academies would convene a 
committee of health and environmental science experts to examine the 
various health impacts of air traffic noise and pollution within 30 
days of enactment. The expert committee would subsequently issue an 
Expert Consensus Report setting forth current scientific knowledge 
regarding the various health impacts of air traffic noise and 
pollution. Upon completion, the National Academies will submit the 
report to the FAA Administrator, the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and 
relevant Congressional Committees, including the House Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure and the House Committee on Oversight 
and Government Reform.
      b.  The deadline for the research should be completed 6 to 9 
months from the date enacted.
      c.  The airports that are studied should be in or very close to 
densely populated cities. We understand that all types of cities will 
be included to have a broad array of data, but this is to ensure that 
cities with airports near dense population centers are included.
      d.  The bill has currently 23 cosponsors.
    5.  Aircraft Ownership Transparency Act, H.R. 2563
      a.  This bill requires that the beneficial ownership of an 
aircraft is identified prior to approval of a certificate of aircraft 
registration by the FAA. In the case of an aircraft owned or controlled 
by more than one entity, the legislation requires identification of the 
relationship between entities. In addition, in the case of a trust or 
association, the legislation calls for the chain of control including 
the owner, trustee, and beneficiary.
      b.  The legislation defines a beneficial owner as ``each natural 
person, who directly or indirectly, exercises control over the covered 
entity through ownership interests, voting rights, agreements, or 
otherwise; or has an interest in or receives substantial economic 
benefits from the assets of the covered entity.
    6.  Faster Responses to flight issues at Logan
      a.  After several troubling incidents at Logan Airport, I 
requested an urgent review of flight operations with FAA officials and 
an update on investigations into recent events. In early March, the 
right wing of a United Airlines plane struck the tail of another United 
Airlines plane, as both were scheduled for departure. One week prior to 
that incident, a JetBlue plane narrowly escaped a collision with a 
Learjet aircraft as it was preparing to land. In addition, a man 
attempted to attack a flight attendant and open an emergency exit door 
on a United Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Boston Logan Airport.
      b.  The FAA is responsible for flight operations, and I have 
already requested a briefing with their officials to get an update on 
their investigations into how these events occurred and proposed 
solutions to ensure they do not continue.
      c.  We must be vigilant and address these issues now to prevent 
more accidents from happening with potentially far worse outcomes.
    7.  Noise Data Collection Act, H.R. 2564
      a.  This bill requires the FAA to expand, on an annual basis, the 
current reporting of Population Exposure at DNL 65 dB and report 
Population Exposure at DNL 46 dB and DNL 55 dB.
      b.  Data provided by FAA OEE personal correspondence to the US 
Department of Transportation Statistics indicates a 39% increase over 
the last 10 pre-Covid years in the number of people in the US who are 
exposed to aviation DNL 65 dB or greater. This is despite the quieter 
engines and despite the FAA's change to satellite navigation and its 
narrowed flight paths that, theoretically, should expose fewer 
individuals.
      c.  Currently, the FAA and the DOT use DNL 65 dB exposure counts 
from 1975 to present in TABLE 4-57 Number of People Residing in Areas 
of Significant Noise Exposure Around U.S. Airports, and on numbered 
page 301, pdf page 326, of DOT Bureau of Transportation Statistics' 
National Transportation Statistics 2021.
    8.  Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)
      a.  Airports are waiting for new firefighting foam alternatives 
from EPA and DOD to be approved; airports do not want to jeopardize 
safety until a viable alternative is in place.
      b.  Provide federal funds for an acquisition program for the new 
foam, a disposal program for the old foam, and PFAS remediation at 
airports.
      c.  Additionally, the FAA must acknowledge the longstanding 
federal requirement on airports to use this firefighting foam by 
providing liability protection to airports.
    9.  Drones
      a.  Under current federal law and regulations, neither Massport 
nor state/local law enforcement partners have the appropriate authority 
or approved technologies to take proactive actions against reckless, 
unlawful, or threatening UAS activity.
      b.  Countering UAS is fundamentally a federal issue. We ask that 
the FAA does its part to provide financial support and resources to 
address ongoing identification and mitigation support to handle this 
national problem.
    10.  Impacted Communities Advisory Committee Act, H.R. 2565
      a.  This bill requires that, not later than 60 days after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall establish in 
the Federal Aviation Administration an Impacted-Communities Advisory 
Committee (ICAC) of members who are directly and substantially affected 
by noise or pollution from Commercial Aviation, General Aviation, and 
currently or potentially impacted communities affected by noise or 
pollution from Advanced Mobility.
      b.  Communities are currently mostly excluded and not engaged by 
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) unlike other ``key external 
stakeholders'' for FAA policy, procedure design, and advisory 
committees. To add another level of community engagement allows the 
constituents to best be heard when they are impacted by excessive 
airport noise.
    11.  Support Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF)
      a.  SAF made from renewable resources that have the potential to 
deliver the same performance of petroleum-based jet fuel while also 
cutting an airplane's carbon footprint.
      b.  I encourage this reauthorization to support funds for 
infrastructure planning with a focus on ensuring geographic diversity 
in SAF production--at this time SAF production is focused on the west 
coast. Logan Airport's infrastructure is in place to accept this new 
type of aviation fuel.
    12.  Peer-Reviewed Report on Metrics and Thresholds Act, H.R. 2561
      a.  This bill directs the FAA, not later than 90 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act, to fund a National Academies Division of 
Medicine-led consensus report, with a subcontract to the National 
Academies Division of Engineering, to recommend a system of measuring 
noise, in accordance with the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act 
(ANSA), that, with a highly reliable relationship, categorizes noise 
levels to determine compatibility for residential use and high 
annoyance areas based on appropriate metrics. As required by ANSA, the 
system for measuring and categorizing noise must use surveyed reactions 
of people, i.e., the Neighborhood Environmental Survey (NES).
    13.  Health and Wellness Fund
      a.  Establish a health and wellness fund from the disruptive 
passenger fines collected by the FAA that Flight Attendants who have 
been assaulted can access to offset the costs of their medical bills, 
seek counseling/therapy, paid time off to testify in court, etc.
      b.  Reports of these incidents last year are more than 20 times 
the amount in a typical year. But these are just the incidents 
reported. Flight Attendants are bearing the brunt of this every day at 
work, including serious injury. It's dangerous, unacceptable, and it's 
got to stop. The FAA has levied approximately $2 million in fines to 
disruptive passengers since January 1, 2022.
      c.  The fines collected by the FAA from disruptive passenger 
incidents for interfering with flight crews should be utilized to 
create and sustain a health and wellness fund that flight crews can 
access to offset the cost of their medical bills, additional time off 
if needed, counseling, time spent testifying in court against their 
assailant, etc.
    14.  Recycling and green infrastructure airport programs
      a.  Programs set to reduce environmental impacts can help 
maintain high, stable levels of economic growth. These plans will help 
achieve ``social progress'', a broad set of actions that ensure 
organizational goals are achieved in a way that's consistent with the 
needs and values of the local community.
      b.  Examples include noise abatement programs and Low Emission 
programs which are able to be used by all airports.
      c.  Existing FAA grants to reduce emissions and improve air 
quality at airports across the country. i.e. fund zero-emission airport 
vehicles, including their electric charging infrastructure and 
electrify the ramp equipment used to service planes at the gate.
    15.  Update Emergency Aircraft Evacuation Standards
      a.  As part of implementing Sections 337 and 577 of the FAA 
Reauthorization Act of 2018, the FAA conducted a study in late 2019 
through early 2020 to determine the effects of different seat 
dimensions and spacing on facilitating emergency evacuations. However, 
the FAA used simulated laboratory conditions, and not a real airplane, 
to conduct its evaluation. Further, the study sample did not include 
any children, adults over 60, or people with disabilities as 
participants.
      b.  Since children, older adults, and people with disabilities 
are the least likely to be able to evacuate an airplane in a safe and 
timely manner, the FAA's study did not demonstrate or accurately depict 
if all passengers can safely evacuate an airplane in under 90 seconds 
(the standard amount of time for an emergency evacuation). Indeed, the 
FAA itself conceded that, because they did not include these groups in 
their study, the study's results were ``not necessarily'' definitive.

    As the committee reviews PHSMA Reauthorization of 2023, I would 
like to emphasize the concern around the approval process for 
compressor stations.
    The basis for this concern stems from the continued operation of 
the Weymouth Compressor Station in my district. Since its initial 
approval by FERC in January of 2017, this 7,700-horsepower facility has 
been the source of serious concerns for local residents, community 
safety groups, non-profit organizations, and local, state, and federal 
elected officials--all of whom continue to underscore the health, 
environmental, and security risks associated with the operation of 
volatile pipeline infrastructure that is located in an environmental 
justice community, adjacent to the Fore River Bridge, within a half-
mile of 1,000 households in the densely populated neighborhood of North 
Weymouth, and in close proximity to several schools, parks, and other 
high-traffic areas in the City of Quincy, the Town of Braintree, and 
the Town of Abington. Considering that the Weymouth Compressor Station 
has already experienced multiple blowdown events and is associated with 
high levels of toxic air pollution and the escalating prevalence of 
lung disease, pediatric asthma, and other illnesses among the Fore 
River Basin population, it is not surprising that FERC Chairman Richard 
Glick recently stated, in part: ``I believe that the Commission likely 
erred in siting the Weymouth Compressor Station where it did.''
    I have repeatedly requested that FERC and PHMSA take immediate 
action to mitigate the actualized and potential risks stemming from the 
continued operation of the Weymouth facility. Regrettably, both 
regulatory agencies have indicated that they lack the jurisdiction or 
authority to further address our community concerns. While FERC 
Chairman Glick has acknowledged the likely improper siting of the 
Weymouth Compressor Station, the Commission continues to assert that 
its regulatory role regarding the facility is ``largely over'' and that 
PHMSA ``has continuing jurisdiction over the public health and safety 
aspects of the compressor station's operations.'' In turn, PHMSA has 
indicated that despite the siting concerns expressed by Chairman Glick 
and the longstanding dangers identified by community stakeholders, the 
agency ``is not aware'' of any condition that would warrant PHMSA or 
the U.S. Department of Transportation to determine that the facility is 
``hazardous to life, property, or the environment'' under current 
pipeline safety regulations and statutes.
    I am concerned that PHMSA does not have adequate resources to 
conduct all of their oversight work and would need more inspectors in 
the field and staff at their headquarters who write rule makings to 
ensure such an incident won't happen again.

    As the committee reviews Coast Guard Reauthorization of 2023, I 
would like to emphasize the following priorities.
    1.  Full Support Port Infrastructure Development Grants
      a.  Our nation's ports need increased funding and the Port 
Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP) has been an excellent way to 
ensure that the critical passageway of goods and services is being 
updated and financially support.
      b.  Our ports are the backbone to our economy. Any way to grow 
our shipping capacity and ensure our supply chain is strong is a smart 
and important investment in our economy.
    2.  Supporting ``Cargo Preference'' Policy
      a.  Cargo preference is the maritime industry's version of ``Buy 
American,'' creating jobs for our maritime workers and supporting the 
maritime industrial base. Cargo preference is vital to national 
security and our economic interests. Not only does this collection of 
laws, regulations, and policies incentivize U.S.-flag vessels in the 
international shipping arena to remain under U.S. registry, but these 
laws also help maintain a U.S. Merchant Marine to serve in times of war 
or national emergency and to carry a substantial portion of U.S. 
domestic and foreign waterborne commerce.
      b.  Despite these critical functions, a myriad of events has 
weakened cargo preference laws over time, contributing to a loss of 
approximately 115 commercial vessels (over 50 percent) in the U.S. 
international fleet over a span of 30 years. The Maritime 
Administration (MARAD) oversees compliance with cargo preference laws, 
but for several years has been derelict in enforcing cargo preference 
requirements partly due to resistance from and disagreement with 
collaborating agencies.
    3.  Protecting of the North Atlantic Right Whales
      a.  This year, I signed an appropriation letter asking for $10 
million in additional funding over FY23 levels for North Atlantic right 
whale conservation.
      b.  Further, we asked that the following increase within the 
Marine Mammals, Sea Turtles, and Other Species line item continuing the 
essential funding of this committee last year in protecting North 
Atlantic right whales including no less than $6,000,000 for the 
development, administration, and acquisition of shore-based, aerial, 
and on-the-water enforcement capabilities for the United States Coast 
Guard and National Marine fisheries Service; and the support of the 
voluntary acquisition of automatic identifications systems by vessel 
owners affected by the enforcement of current and forthcoming vessel 
speed restrictions.

    Thank you for your hard work and dedication for the future of 
aviation and the FAA.

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Seth Magaziner, a Representative in Congress 
                     From the State of Rhode Island
    Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen:
    Thank you for the opportunity to offer testimony to the 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and elevate Rhode 
Islanders' priorities as you prepare to reauthorize federal aviation 
programs. The Ocean State's aviation industry generates more than $2.66 
billion in economic output annually and is responsible for producing 
more than 18,500 jobs. A long-term reauthorization is critical for 
growing Rhode Island's aviation sector, advancing innovation, improving 
safety, and benefiting the flying public. I urge you to include the 
following priorities that will help build a pipeline of new workers, 
address staffing shortages, improve aviation infrastructure, and help 
restore trust between passengers and airlines.
Consumer Protection
      Request: Include the FAIR Fees Act
        Rationale: Americans can only make informed purchasing 
decisions and budget appropriately if they can accurately compare 
airline prices and fees. I applaud the Biden Administration for taking 
steps to end this exploitative practice, and urge the Committee to 
codify common sense transparency rules into law, such as requiring 
airlines and booking services to disclose total costs upfront. I thank 
Aviation Subcommittee Ranking Member Cohen for his years of advocacy in 
this space, including his work leading the FAIR Fees Act.

      Request: Prohibit Airlines from Charging Families for 
Requesting to Sit with their Children
        Rationale: As a parent, I find it exploitative that 
airlines can restrict families from sitting together on flights unless 
they pay extra, and I consider these policies particularly inequitable 
when taking into account the hardships faced by families with limited 
financial resources. It's simple: airlines shouldn't nickel and dime 
parents just to allow them to sit next to their young children. While 
the Department of Transportation is attempting to curb these practices 
administratively, Congress should crack down on these uncalled-for fees 
once and for all.

      Request: Include the Cash Refunds for Flight 
Cancellations Act
        Rationale: The Biden Administration is making it clear 
that carriers have a responsibility to provide timely refunds when 
certain cancellations or significant changes occur to a scheduled 
flight. Rep. Cohen's Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations Act would 
ensure passengers are quickly and fairly compensated for unreasonable 
cancellations or significant delays within an airline's control.
Accessibility
      Request: Pass the Air Carrier Access Amendments Act
        Rationale: We must make air travel more inclusive and 
equitable for all Americans, including those with disabilities. The Air 
Carrier Access Act has been the law of the land for 37 years, but 
passengers with disabilities still struggle to find accommodations at 
airports or navigate while onboard an aircraft. Moreover, we've seen a 
concerning uptick in disability-related complaints, with a 54 percent 
jump in claims in 2021 compared to 2019. The Air Carrier Access 
Amendments Act, a bill championed by former Rep. Jim Langevin, will 
help make air travel more accessible for individuals with disabilities 
and give them and the federal government new tools to penalize bad 
actors.
Expand the Airport Terminal Program
      Request: Allow More Expenses to be Eligible for the 
Airport Terminal Program
        Rationale: In 1996, the Bruce Sundlun Terminal building 
opened, allowing for the expansion of several carriers into the Rhode 
Island T.F. Green International Airport (PVD). To safely accommodate 
the thousands of passengers flying to and from the airport every day, 
the terminal requires $25 million in updates. However, limitations 
under the Airport Terminal Program (ATP) are restricting the airport's 
operator from making critical improvements, including upgrading the 
backup power and water systems, expanding seating capacity, renovating 
the concourse, and modernizing security.
Ensure the Airport Improvement Program Meets Local Needs
      Request: Expand Eligible Projects for the Airport 
Improvement Program
        Rationale: Cargo operations at PVD are largely housed 
in a decades-old-hanger, and the airport's operator, the Rhode Island 
Airport Corporation (RIAC), believes a modern facility is needed to 
provide carriers space for storage, sorting, and other needs. RIAC 
wants to mitigate light and sound emanating from the area to the 
greatest extent possible, given that the relocated facility abuts 
residential properties. Unfortunately, the Federal Aviation 
Administration's New England Region (FAA-NER) claims that a buffer 
between the development and the neighborhood is ineligible for funding 
under the Airport Improvement Program. Similar concerns are emerging at 
Quonset State Airport (OQU), where an approximately 9,000 linear foot 
seawall requires immediate repair. The results of a recent seawall 
inspection show that the northwest and north bulkheads are in critical 
condition. In order to address resiliency at OQU, RIAC must take 
several steps to reconstruct the existing seawall. I urge the Committee 
to ensure Airport Improvement Program funds can cover the full scope of 
costs for these types of essential projects.
Help the Aviation Sector Address Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities
      Request: Provide Funding for Aviation Cybersecurity 
Compliance
        Rationale: As a member of the Homeland Security 
Committee, I understand the critical need to insulate our nation's 
critical infrastructure from cyber threats. The Transportation Security 
Administration (TSA) recognizes the heightened threats against the 
aviation sector and recently announced plans to require certain 
entities to develop cyber resiliency plans. Providing a funding 
structure to support compliance in the aviation sector warrants 
consideration.
Workforce Development
      Request: Support the Aviation WORKS Act
        Rationale: The aviation industry is experiencing a 
range of labor challenges, from an aging workforce to pilot shortages 
to gaps in the manufacturing sector. The 2018 FAA Reauthorization 
created the Aviation Workforce Development Grant Program to grow the 
pipeline of pilots and maintenance technical workers. Congress should 
build on this program's success--an idea central to Ranking Member 
Larsen's Aviation WORKS Act.
Air Traffic Controller Staffing
      Request: Consider New Methodologies for Determining Air 
Traffic Controller Staffing Needs
        Rationale: Air traffic controllers ensure the safe, 
timely, and organized arrival and departure of aircrafts. 
Unfortunately, the FAA employs fewer Certified Professional Controllers 
(CPCs) than a decade ago. A staffing shortage at one facility 
reverberates through the entire aviation system: too few crew at the 
Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center hinders the ability to manage 
traffic in Providence. The Committee should reconsider whether the 
FAA's Controller Workforce Plan accurately meets staffing needs or 
whether to move towards the model offered by the Collaborative Resource 
Workgroup.
Responding to Weather Disruptions
      Request: Study How the Aviation Sector is Responding to 
Extreme Weather
        Rationale: Since the passage of the 2018 FAA 
Reauthorization, passengers have experienced a range of travel 
disruptions caused by snow, ice, high winds, heat, and other conditions 
that prevented them from visiting loved ones, traveling for business, 
or taking a vacation. The federal government should study air carriers' 
preparedness for responding to these weather-related incidents.
Addressing Regulatory Processes
      Request: Encourage the FAA and Coast Guard to Ensure the 
Timely and Safe Certification and Regulation of Wing in Ground Effect 
(WIG) Vehicles
        Rationale: WIGs, which the FAA interprets as sharing 
similarities with seaplanes, fly at low altitudes over the water. I'm 
concerned that regulatory confusion between the FAA and Coast Guard may 
slow the introduction of new technologies, such as WIGs. I encourage 
the Committee to find a reasonable solution that promotes cooperation 
between agencies and facilitates the timely, safe, and responsible 
introduction of WIGs.

      Request: Study Ways to Expand Airline Service to Smaller 
Communities on Smaller Aircrafts
        Rationale: The standards for aircraft design, 
construction, and operation must prioritize safety. The FAA should also 
evaluate those standards and consider ways to allow more kinds of 
aircrafts to serve smaller communities. I encourage the Committee to 
have the FAA study regulatory changes that could incentivize aircraft 
manufacturers to produce planes that fulfill smaller-seat aircraft 
needs and ensure service to small communities.

    Thank you for your consideration.

                                 
  Prepared Statement of Hon. Gwen Moore, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of Wisconsin
    Thank you Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen for the 
opportunity to submit testimony.
    As this committee begins work on key legislation during the 118th 
Congress, I want to make sure that it keeps at the top of its list, the 
need to continue to help ensure the federal government live up to its 
longstanding policy of ensuring that businesses that have been 
historically discriminated against have the opportunity to compete and 
win work on federal funded transportation projects.
    Particularly for FAA reauthorization, I urge the Committee to build 
on work from the last two reauthorizations including provisions I 
championed to push the FAA to strengthen its DBE efforts.
    Each year, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) distributes 
more than $3 billion in Federal grants for airport projects. In 
accepting these grants, airports are required to establish 
disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) and airport concession DBE 
(ACDBE) programs.
    Congress has long recognized the pernicious role that 
discrimination has played in denying certain qualified businesses 
operated by socially disadvantaged individuals from competing for and 
winning work on transportation projects.
    This policy is enshrined in sec. 157 of the FAA Reauthorization Act 
of 2018 in which Congress found that ``while significant progress has 
occurred due to the establishment of the airport disadvantaged business 
enterprise program, discrimination and related barriers continue to 
pose significant obstacles for minority- and women-owned businesses 
seeking to do business in airport-related markets across the Nation. 
These continuing barriers merit the continuation of the airport 
disadvantaged business enterprise program.''
    There remains a compelling need to take commonsense steps to 
improve the FAA's ability to address known barriers and better assist 
these businesses and truly ensure that minority and women contractors 
and workers can fairly compete.
    Unless we pay attention here, I am afraid that many qualified 
minority and women owned businesses will continue to be denied a fair 
opportunity to compete for work.
    It is critical that upcoming FAA reauthorization legislation 
continue to build on efforts improve FAA oversight, transparency, and 
data collection practices regarding FAA DBE participation so we can 
keep removing barriers to competition for all businesses and ensure 
that there is in fact a fair playing field when it comes to bidding for 
work on federally funding airport projects.
    The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 included my amendment to 
address a concern about failure of successful DBE's to be promptly paid 
that I and others have heard across DOT programs.
    No business--small, DBE, or otherwise--can remain viable if it does 
not get paid in a timely fashion for the satisfactory work it has done. 
U.S. DoT regulations require prompt payment because the Department has 
long recognized the burden that delayed payments cause for small 
businesses, including DBE's.
    The Department's prompt payment requirement applies to all 
subcontractors regardless of race. As noted by DOT, Prompt payment 
provisions are an important race-neutral mechanism that can benefit 
DBEs and all other small businesses.
    The Department's existing regulations require prime contractors to 
pay subcontractors for satisfactory performance of their contracts no 
later than 30 days from receipt of each payment from the grantee.
    DBE contractors are significantly affected by late payments from 
prime contractors, and lack of prompt payment constitutes a very real 
barrier to the ability of DBEs to compete in the marketplace. In one 
report, the DOT Inspector General noted that ``half of the new DBE 
firms we interviewed cited difficulty in receiving timely payments from 
their prime contractors. One DBE owner was not paid by her prime 
contractor for 6 weeks after payment was due and had to take out more 
than $180,000 in personal loans to pay her 63 employees.''
    My amendment to the 2018 FAA reauthorization law required airports 
with a DBE program to track delayed payment complaints and to report 
those complaints to the FAA. It also required the FAA to assess whether 
this prompt payment rule is being satisfied, how airports are enforcing 
the requirements, and whether improvements need to be made to help 
resolve complaints in a timely manner. Those reports have been helpful 
but even FAA continues to note that given the small number of such 
reports that have been forwarded and continuing anecdotal evidence of 
difficulties getting paid promptly, more can be done here.
    And I want to be clear that this is not just a FAA problem. I was 
proud to have language included in the FAST Act urging the U.S. 
Department of Transportation to enforce its requirements that DBE's be 
promptly paid.
    As the FAA reauthorization moves forward, I have introduced 
legislation (H.R. 2507) to continue to take steps to strengthen the 
ability of the FAA to allow all small businesses to compete for work 
and I hope the committee will include provisions from that bill in FAA 
legislation that it takes up.
    And overall, as this Committee considers transportation broadly, it 
must continue to consider ways to strengthen efforts to increase DBE 
participation. We need to be proactive. When Congress is silent, little 
to no participation by DBE's occurs. This includes strengthening DOT 
programs focused on helping DBE's and small businesses, including 
providing additional resources, and better supporting the Department's 
Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization. Lastly, we 
cannot forget the need to increase access to capital. The DOT's ability 
to address capital needs of DBE and small business concerns must be 
strengthened.
    I hope you agree with me that fostering a safe and modern 
transportation system and promoting small businesses are not 
conflicting goals; it actually makes good and sound economic and 
transportation policy.
    Transportation projects mean jobs and businesses for communities 
across our nation and ensuring that all businesses in our communities, 
including small and disadvantaged concerns owned businesses, must 
remain a priority.
                        Protect Transit Workers
    I also think it is critical that the Committee continue to take 
steps to improve safety for the transit operators and workers who are 
critical to the safe movement of millions of passengers each day in our 
country.
    As noted by a UW-Milwaukee report, ``strong, healthy public transit 
systems are essential to the economic well-being of metropolitan 
regions.'' Among many factors to having such strong systems, are the 
dedicated workforce that serve our communities every day.
    In the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) and 
the Bipartisan Infrastructure law, Congress enacted provisions to help 
improve safety, including requiring new FTA guidance and regulations. 
For example, Section 3022 of the FAST Act required FTA to issue rules 
requiring recipients of Federal transit funding to assess the risk of 
assault to transit operators and then determine what, if any, 
mitigation should be implemented to ensure the safety of transit 
operators.
    It is critical that the Committee continue to provide oversight to 
ensure that these new tools are implemented quickly and effectively to 
help protect our transit workers. The FTA has rightly acknowledged in 
the past that ``any form of violence against transit workers poses a 
serious threat on the physical safety and emotion well-being of transit 
workers and also endangers the safety of passengers and the public.''
    Transit operators continue to have to deal with rowdy/mentally ill 
passengers, neighborhood violence impacting their routes, and other 
unsafe conditions that not only threaten their own health and well-
being but that of their passengers.
    Earlier this year in Chicago, a man was arrested after he 
sideswiped a transit bus and threatened the bus driver with a gun. In 
Hawaii, a woman attacked a bus driver after a fare dispute. A few years 
ago in my district, a bus driver was stabbed. These aren't isolated 
incidents.
    We need to take care of our transit operators who shouldn't have to 
risk their lives just to do their jobs. I urge this Committee to 
continue to take this issue seriously and to consider additional 
measures to take to help protect our transit operators and riders. This 
could include authorizing a Bus Driver Safety Pilot grant program by 
which U.S. DOT, working with the Department of Homeland Security, 
encouraging transit agencies to work more closely with local police 
departments and other stakeholders to increase security along transit 
routes.
              Public Engagement in Transportation Planning
    Too many communities in our country have been torn apart by 
transportation policies that often have excluded the voices of those 
most affected by the projects. We have enough examples of massive 
highway projects ripping apart communities, increased exposure to noise 
and other pollutants, and resulted in infrastructural barriers within 
the community that created obstacles for mobility and economic 
development for underserved communities.
    It is critical therefore that federal transportation policies not 
only try to repair the damage that failed past policies have done, but 
help prevent such harmful impacts by continuing to protect the ability 
of communities of all means to meaningfully participate and engage in 
the planning and execution of federally funded transportation projects. 
That includes preserving and protecting the requirement that grantees 
of federal funds meaningfully engage communities, hold public hearings, 
thoroughly and sincerely consider alternatives, and provide ample time 
to solicit, receive, and consider public comments.
    Short circuiting a real and meaningful public engagement process 
through NEPA or other statues, through actions such as imposing 
arbitrary timelines for critical decisions, will do more harm than 
good, and potentially result in losing critical voices, comments, and 
insights that might help make a project truly meet local needs of all 
local communities, rather than of a select few.
    The federal government has a vested interest and should financially 
support efforts to directly educate community members about 
opportunities to affect transportation planning and investment 
decisions, data gathering, and other information relevant to such 
decisions and to make such information easily available in plain 
language as early and in as many accessible formats as possible, to 
ensure community members are directly engaged in those processes.
    More proactive and meaningful community participation and 
engagement on federal projects results in better projects and better 
use of taxpayer funds.

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Jerrold Nadler, a Representative in Congress 
                       From the State of New York
    Thank you, Chair Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, for holding this 
Member Day Hearing and allowing for written testimony to be submitted.
    The New York metropolitan area has one of the highest rates of 
helicopter use in the world. The region is the most densely populated 
metro region in the United States, exponentially increasing the 
potential dangers of a helicopter accident in our city. Since 1983, 
we've had at least 30 helicopter crashes in New York City, with at 
least 25 fatalities, according to National Transportation Safety Board 
records.
    Over the past decade, the region has seen increased numbers of non-
essential tourism and commuter helicopters. Helicopter-related noise 
complaints to 311 have gone up in New York City by over 2300% in the 
last five years, and helicopter safety, noise, and environmental 
concerns are now one of the top issues I hear about from my 
constituents.
    The overwhelming number of helicopter flights over New York City 
creates intolerable risks to the community and negative impacts on the 
quality of life of all its residents. For this reason, I introduced The 
Improving Helicopter Safety Act of 2021 to prohibit non-essential 
helicopter flights over New York City. I also introduced the Helicopter 
Safety and Noise Management Act, modeled after the Air Tour Management 
Plan legislation from 2000, aimed at decreasing helicopter-related 
disruptions for National Park visitors. Finally, I have submitted 
appropriations language calling for the House Appropriations Committee 
to take action to ensure that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
works to adequately address helicopter noise and safety concerns in the 
New York Metropolitan Area.
    I have also written to the FAA several times--most recently in 
2019--requesting that the agency issue Temporary Flight Restrictions to 
prohibit non-essential helicopter flights over the city. Despite 
requests for action from the majority of the New York City 
Congressional Delegation, the FAA has failed to take meaningful steps 
to address this issue.
    It is clear from our meetings and correspondence that the FAA 
values the financial well-being of a handful of helicopter tour 
operators more than they do the livelihoods and safety of over 20 
million residents in the New York metropolitan area.
    I request that the committee include language in the 2023 FAA 
Reauthorization Bill to adequately address the New York metropolitan 
area's helicopter safety, noise, and environmental concerns. I also 
request that you include legislation to ensure that the FAA implements 
the NTSB's recommended enhanced safety regulations for air tour 
operators, such as addressing exceptions, exemptions, and perceived 
safety loopholes and shortcomings in Part 91 passenger-carrying revenue 
operations.
    Air tour operators in the New York metropolitan region, Hawaii, and 
across the nation have gone unchecked by the federal government while 
they disrupt whole communities with excessive noise and other impacts 
and increase safety risks to not only passengers but those on the 
ground. I urge the committee to work with the Quiet Skies Caucus, the 
New York metropolitan area delegation, the Hawaii delegation, and 
others to ensure that the FAA adequately addresses non-essential 
helicopter safety, noise, and environmental concerns.
    Thank you, and I look forward to working with you and the committee 
to address this important issue.

                                 
  Prepared Statement of Hon. Bill Pascrell, Jr., a Representative in 
                 Congress From the State of New Jersey
    Thank you very much to Chairman Sam Graves and Ranking Member Rick 
Larsen for the opportunity to testify at the Committee's 2023 Member 
Day. I also want to recognize my Democratic New Jersey colleagues on 
the Committee, Representatives Donald Payne, Jr. and Rob Menendez.
    As a former committee member, I know the essential role this 
committee plays in developing transportation policy for our nation. For 
this Member Day hearing, I want to focus on the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) Reauthorization. I am seeking relief for those 
northern New Jersey constituents who are having their lives disrupted 
by pervasive noise that is reportedly coming from helicopters flying 
close to our neighborhoods at various hours of the day and night.
    I appreciate that several factors are related to the source of 
helicopter noise, but it is having an adverse impact on North 
Jerseyans' quality of life. Residents of New Jersey's Ninth 
Congressional District have regularly informed my office that 
helicopter flights have increased in frequency. There have been 
complaints to both my office and local media reports about helicopter 
activity that has disturbed sleeping patterns and caused homes to 
shake. Studies detailing the negative impacts of aircraft noise, 
including from helicopters,\1\ have found it causes disturbances that 
can increase community annoyance, disrupt sleep, adversely affect 
academic performance of children, and even increase the risk for 
cardiovascular disease.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There are several flight operators in the tri-state area and North 
Jersey region, including private businesses involved in transit or 
tours, as well as public operations that involve military, law 
enforcement, or air medical evacuation missions. The public safety 
records of these operators are checkered. Indeed, a helicopter operated 
by a private company crashed soon after takeoff at Essex County 
Airport, causing serious injuries to the pilot.\2\ Initial reports from 
the National Transportation Safety Board indicated that the aircraft 
may have had faulty repairs before takeoff.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I hope there are actions we can include in the FAA reauthorization 
to address my constituents' growing aggravation at residential 
helicopter noise. Specifically, I am encouraging the Committee to 
include language that would implement recommendations from the U.S. 
Government Accountability Office (U.S. GAO) that requires the FAA to 
develop a mechanism to improve the sharing of information regarding 
noise complaints. While recent U.S. GAO recommendations have focused on 
Washington, D.C.,\3\ the entire nation would benefit from such a tool. 
This mechanism should require helicopter operators to share helicopter 
noise complaints they receive with the FAA and have the FAA direct 
complaints to the appropriate helicopter operator.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-200.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Additionally, I recommend the Committee include language that would 
implement a GAO recommendation to improve FAA officials' ability to 
identify the helicopter operators, which is an issue because of the 
opaque ownership structures (such as limited liability corporations) 
used by owners to register their aircraft using historical data.\4\ The 
use of such ownership structures limits FAA's oversight of these 
aircrafts, and with it public transparency.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Thank you very much for your time and attention to my request. I 
look forward to introducing legislation with these goals in mind soon. 
I hope we can work together to resolve helicopter noise issues facing 
my neighbors.

                                 
    Prepared Statement of Hon. Scott H. Peters, a Representative in 
                 Congress From the State of California
    Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen:
    Thank you for hosting ``Member Day'' for your colleagues like me 
who have important priorities in front of the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee.
    I'd like to highlight two issues that affect my district and the 
country as a whole:
    1.  Ocean Pollution Reduction Act II; and
    2.  issues of public transportation, density, and housing.

    First, I introduced H.R. 1720, the Ocean Pollution Reduction Act 
II, with the support of all members of the San Diego delegation, Reps. 
Levin, Jacobs, Vargas, and Issa. This bill will provide the City of San 
Diego with regulatory certainty as it continues to make significant 
progress, as well as major investments, in enhancing its water and 
wastewater systems.
    The Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant (PLWTP) is located in San 
Diego, CA. It currently treats 175 million gallons of wastewater per 
day, serving 2.2 million residents and 12 water agencies in a 450-
square-mile area. PLWTP's ocean outfall is 4.5 miles and 300 feet deep 
and is one of the longest and deepest outfalls in the world. Since 
2010, the PLWTP has met alternate discharge for total suspended solids 
(TSS) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) under a modified National 
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit approved by EPA 
as authorized by section 301(h) of the Clean Water Act and the Ocean 
Pollution Reduction Act of 1994 (OPRA). As part of its efforts to meet 
these alternate standards, the City is making a long-term investment in 
the Pure Water Program, a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar program that 
will use proven water purification technology to provide one-third of 
San Diego's water supply by 2035. This is crucial to reducing reliance 
on the heavily drought-stricken, nearly depleted Colorado River.
    The Ocean Pollution Reduction Act II replaces the complex and 
expensive secondary treatment permit application with a simpler 
process, so long as the City of San Diego meets stringent water 
recycling milestones. Under the bill, the City must demonstrate that 
its Pure Water Program can produce 83 million gallons a day of water by 
2036, nearly one-half of the City's entire water supply. This 
legislation does not modify the Clean Water Act and maintains the 
protections of the Clean Water Act for wastewater treatment facilities 
across the country, while also adding additional requirements to 
discharge standards and enhanced environmental monitoring specifically 
for Point Loma.
    This program and legislation are supported by a broad coalition of 
environmental, labor, business, and community leaders because it 
provides regulatory certainty while also securing an independent, 
drought-resilient supply of water.
    The bill passed the House last Congress by suspension in June 2021, 
as well as in November 2020 in the 115th Congress. With your help, I 
look forward to getting this bill passed the House again and signed 
into law this Congress.
    Second, I would like to stress the importance of investing in 
public transportation that prioritizes decongesting our roads, 
increases sustainability, and supports regional housing planning.
    I urge the Committee to encourage more commuters to take public 
transportation and reduce vehicle miles traveled. The Committee can 
promote smart growth by incentivizing local communities to change their 
zoning policies and tying these investments to federal transit dollars. 
The federal government can only support a limited number of projects. 
We must prioritize projects that will generate ridership that will 
demonstrably offer automobile alternatives and minimize greenhouse gas 
emissions.
    To this end, I encourage you to consider my bill, the Build More 
Housing Near Transit Act, which will help increase housing supply to 
keep rents affordable for families and grow ridership of transit lines.
    Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to continuing to 
work with you on these and other issues.

                                 
  Prepared Statement of Hon. Brittany Pettersen, a Representative in 
                  Congress From the State of Colorado
    As the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee prepares to 
reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Congress has a 
historic chance to make the airline industry cleaner, safer, and more 
friendly to workers, while also providing historic support to 
communities. Congress must be focused on modernizing the airline 
industry in a safe and efficient way. This must include ensuring that 
airlines have proper protocols and resources to prevent overdose 
prevention on their aircraft, scaling off of leaded fuels at a much 
more rapid pace, to more rapidly protect workers and communities from 
exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and consider 
equitable and broad protections for paid sick-leave.
                    Overdose Prevention on Aircrafts
    In the United States, drug overdose deaths are the leading cause of 
injury-related deaths. In 2021 alone, over 107,000 people died from 
drug-involved overdoses--a number that has tragically more than doubled 
in the past 10 years. There were 1,289 deaths from opioids in Colorado 
alone, which accounted for 68 percent of all overdose deaths in the 
state. Today the vast majority of these deaths are caused by opioids, 
but we now have the power to dramatically reduce these numbers through 
the use and availability of Naloxone, an easily administered medication 
that reverses opioid overdoses.
    I urge the Committee to include language in the FAA Authorization 
Act to require certain air carriers to carry naloxone on aircraft. The 
FAA has demonstrated support for this requirement since 2018 and I will 
introduce legislation to require airlines to carry life-saving overdose 
antidotes like naloxone onboard.
   Stepping Down from Leaded Aircraft Fuel and Addressing Pollutants 
                               Equitably
    One of the more pressing issues in my district is daily exposure to 
lead pollution through emissions from the continued use of leaded fuels 
on aircraft. This occurs throughout the district, from airports in 
Broomfield, to airports in Chaffee County, to airports in Jefferson 
County. We know that lead exposure has disastrous, enduring, and far-
ranging health consequences, and treatment is long and painful. 
Prevention is our best option.
    In February 2022, the FAA announced the Eliminate Aviation Gasoline 
Lead Emissions (EAGLE) initiative. This public-private partnership aims 
to transition to lead-free aviation fuels for all piston engine 
aircraft by 2030. While proposal is well intentioned, expediting the 
transition is critical. In Colorado, our kids continue to be exposed to 
leaded fuels through water, soil, and air. Leaded gasoline for on road 
vehicles was phased out in 1996 because of the known adverse health 
impacts and yet more than 17 years later, some aircraft continue to 
legally use it.
    The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) predicts that upwards of 
20 percent of a person's total exposure to lead is through their 
drinking water. Lead exposure is pervasive and can be experienced 
through our pipes or pollutants from our aviation industry and we must 
invest in broad upgrades to our water infrastructure. Particularly for 
frontline communities and otherwise marginalized communities, we must 
boldly address pollution exposure.
    Much of Colorado's 7th Congressional District experiences adverse 
aviation impacts from noise and emissions, and I urge the Committee to 
take a serious look at improving community relations and health 
outcomes for individuals who live in the vicinity of airports.
    Continued exposure to lead and pollutants is needless and 
unacceptable, and we must swiftly transition away from these harmful 
pollutants to protect the health and welfare of our constituents that 
live near and around airports.
                   Exposure to ``Forever Chemicals''
    At airports throughout Colorado's 7th Congressional and the 
country, we continue to see the use of aqueous film forming foam 
(AFFF), a fire suppressant used to extinguish flammable liquid fires 
such as fuel fires. In fact, the FAA requires that all commercial 
airports train with, calibrate equipment with, and use the best 
performing AFFF fire suppression systems. However, AFFF contains 
``forever chemicals,'' or PFAS, which are also known to be human 
carcinogens. Congress has taken steps in recent years to limit and 
phase out PFAS due to the known health impacts, but more must be done. 
Essentially, these mandatory FAA requirements, while fighting fuel 
fires, also routinely expose airport workers to harmful chemicals every 
day on the job.
    I urge the T&I Committee to consider the risks that aviation 
workers routinely face in their line of work, and I would welcome the 
opportunity to work alongside the Committee to boldly address PFAS 
exposure through the FAA just as Congress has continued to do through 
the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) in recent years.
                      Paid Medical and Sick Leave
    Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our airport and aviation 
workforce were essential workers ensuring that the travel sector was 
able to continue to operate. Congress recognized the importance of the 
airline industry and aviation businesses by providing them a specific 
lifeline of $46 billion in loans through the CARES Act. The seven 
largest passenger airlines were awarded loans totaling approximately 
$20.8 billion.
    However, many airlines still refuse to provide basic paid family 
and medical leave to their employees. In Colorado, this has been made 
clear by two airlines choosing not to comply with the state's Healthy 
Families and Workplaces Act, legislation that I helped enact in the 
state. We need comprehensive reform to support airline and airport 
workers across the United States who serve passengers in multiple 
states and who remain the backbone of the aviation industry. Investing 
in our workforce and capitalizing on the efforts underscored throughout 
my testimony, demonstrates commonsense pathways for us to build 
resilient communities and a thriving workforce. The FAA Reauthorization 
is an ideal vehicle to include language providing for paid family leave 
for our aviation and airport workforce.
                        Uinta Basin Rail Project
    The Uinta Basin Rail Project is a proposed freight rail line that 
would connect the Uinta Basin in Utah to the national rail network. The 
current proposal is a collaborative Public-Private Partnership effort 
developed between seven counties in Utah, the Rio Grande Pacific 
Corporation, and Drexel Hamilton Infrastructure Partners. In 2021, the 
Surface Transportation Board approved the railway's construction. This 
rail line would route as many as five trains a day through Colorado and 
along the Colorado River--a lifeline for nearly 40 million people, 
including 30 Native American Tribes, across seven states that all 
states rely on the health and integrity of the Colorado River which is 
already facing record low reserves. The rail lines are expected to 
primarily transport crude oil from the Basin to markets across the 
country.
    While significant outreach was done for stakeholders in Utah, a 
much less comprehensive process was undertaken in Colorado, and many 
significant stakeholders were not consulted as the project was 
developed. Many in Colorado feel that environmental concerns regarding 
the project have not yet been heard. We deserve an equitable voice in 
any conversations regarding resources, particularly in the aftermath of 
the East Palestine train derailment and subsequent environmental 
damage.
          Support for Small, Rural and Underserved Communities
    Additionally, a continued concern from small, rural, and 
underserved communities is being unable to access federal grants that 
they should be eligible. Congress must explore waiving matching 
requirements for rural and underserved communities while also creating 
programs to fund specific grant writers for communities that cannot 
afford them. I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to ensure that constituents are not deterred by high matching 
requirements for grants and that rural communities are equipped with 
the technical assistance necessary to successfully draw down federal 
grant dollars.
          Federal Correctional Complex, Florence--No Fly Zone
    The Federal Correctional Complex (FCC) Florence consists of four 
facilities, including the nation's only supermax facility. One of the 
most significant security threats associated with FCC Florence is the 
lack of a No Fly Zone over the prison grounds. It is one of the largest 
security threats facing the prison and, for the safety of prison 
personnel and the inmates, the Committee must explore a No Fly Zone 
over the prison complex.
    Thank you for consideration of these requests and I look forward to 
working with the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to improve 
our nation's aviation system.

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. August Pfluger, a Representative in Congress 
                        From the State of Texas
    Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen:
    Thank you for providing Members the opportunity to share our 
priorities for the 118th Congress. As a native West Texan and U.S. Air 
Force Veteran, I understand the security implications of being a step 
behind our adversaries and the potential rural America may offer in 
closing that gap. As the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee 
begins to work on the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) reauthorization, 
I urge the Committee to consider streamlined, consistent funding for 
rural spaceports, and the establishment of a hypersonic corridor 
between Midland Spaceport and Spaceport America.
    The Midland International Air and Space Port Business Park is the 
first commercial spaceport co-located with an FAA Part 139 commercial 
airport. This spaceport, an FAA-approved Commercial Space Launch and 
Re-Entry Site is ideal for companies producing, testing, and launching 
satellites and reusable vehicles. Without streamlined, consistent 
funding, developing spaceports, like Midland, are unable to proactively 
plan for future projects. For spaceports to effectively participate in 
the rapidly growing industry, it is imperative they have certainty in 
funding levels.
    Due to the location of the Midland Spaceport in the Permian Basin 
of west Texas, a set of airspace corridors between Midland 
International Air and Space Port and Spaceport America would capitalize 
on opportunities for flight research, development, and testing of air 
and spacecraft. The feasibility and viability of having these point-to-
point, unique airspace corridors have been tested and will allow 
operations for space, hypersonic, and supersonic vehicles.
    The Midland Spaceport is contributing to the United States' 
hypersonic defense and commercial leadership by developing advancements 
to enhance U.S. military and commercial hypersonic capabilities. These 
advancements are critical to maintaining our strategic competition with 
China, Russia, and other adversaries whose hypersonic and sub/orbital 
group and air research capabilities are progressing rapidly.
    Additionally, space companies that establish themselves at 
spaceports can generate thousands of high-paying jobs and education 
opportunities for rural Americans. Not only will jobs in traditional 
sectors like fabrication, construction, and operations be made 
available, spaceports have the potential to offer new, innovative 
career paths that currently do not exist. Emboldening spaceports in our 
rural regions will spur opportunities will have significant economic 
benefits across the state and throughout the nation.
    Emerging technologies in both terrestrial and space applications 
are poised to change our world dramatically in the coming decades. 
Spaceports around the country, including west Texas, are eager to do 
their part in providing a strategic advantage to the future and 
security of our nation. I appreciate your consideration of these 
requests to streamline funding to rural spaceports and establish a 
hypersonic corridor between Midland Spaceport and Spaceport America. I 
look forward to working with you in future endeavors.

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Raul Ruiz, a Representative in Congress From 
                        the State of California
    Thank you, Chair Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, for holding 
today's Member Day hearing. I appreciate the opportunity to highlight 
the City of Banning's desire to close the Banning Municipal Airport, 
which I would like to see the Committee address through the FAA 
reauthorization bill this year.
    Over the last several years, the airport has operated with an 
annual deficit, meaning residents of this disadvantaged community are 
using their tax dollars to subsidize airport operations, maintenance, 
and repairs. The airport is currently home to only 29 based aircraft, 
with the overwhelming majority of those owned by non-residents of the 
city. Despite efforts to attract and retain a fixed-based operator to 
make the airport an attractive alternative to surrounding airports, the 
airport has been operating without one for several years. Furthermore, 
there are general aviation airports within a 30 minute flight time of 
the Banning Municipal Airport that would benefit from the closure of 
the airport due to the relocation of aircraft, increased operations, 
and reduced demand on federal funding.
    In 2016, the City of Banning commissioned an Airport Feasibility 
Study to analyze the future of the Banning Municipal Airport and 
determine the best use of the airport property. The study confirmed 
that the airport had created a financial burden for the city. Instead 
of maintaining the airport, the study found that the airport property 
is ideally suited for logistics, e-commerce, and light manufacturing 
industries.
    Recognizing the economic realities of the Banning Municipal 
Airport, in 2017, the Banning City Council overwhelmingly passed a 
resolution ``declaring that it shall be a goal of the city of Banning 
to close the Banning Municipal Airport as soon as legally permitted.'' 
The city continues to support the airport's closure and the property's 
redevelopment.
    In addition to unlocking economic development opportunities for the 
City of Banning, the closure of the airport would benefit the Morongo 
Band of Mission Indians by removing easements on lands held in trust 
adjacent to the airport.
    As the Committee considers FAA reauthorization legislation this 
year, I ask that you include language that would release the Banning 
Municipal Airport from its Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
obligations, allowing the city to repurpose the land. My Banning 
Airport Redevelopment Act (H.R.7729, 116th Congress) would accomplish 
this goal and free up more than 150 acres of land ideally situated for 
development of logistics, e-commerce, and light manufacturing 
industries.
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide this testimony, and I hope 
the Committee will include this important request in the FAA 
reauthorization bill.

                                 
   Prepared Statement of Hon. Mary Gay Scanlon, a Representative in 
             Congress From the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
    Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, thank you for the 
opportunity to share my priorities as your committee embarks on its 
important work this Congress.
    As you draft the text of the Federal Aviation Administration 
Reauthorization Act, I want to stress the importance of robust and 
dependable funding for our nation's airports. I represent Philadelphia 
International Airport, which serves millions of domestic and 
international travelers each year. Like many of our nation's airports, 
PHL is old--the original facilities date to 1925--and despite this, it 
must serve an ever-increasing number of passengers and air traffic each 
year.
    While the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act made a much-needed 
investment in our nation's airport infrastructure, our airports need 
the certainty of consistent, robust, and long-term funding so that they 
can provide first-rate service now and in the future.
    The most straightforward way to address this funding gap is to 
raise the Passenger Facility Charge and index it to inflation. The PFC 
provides airports with a predictable source of funding proportional to 
the volume of travelers they serve that can be used to pay for or 
finance capital improvements to airport infrastructure. The PFC has 
been debated for the past quarter century, and in that time, inaction 
caused the quality of our nation's airports to decline. Every year, 
airports see more passengers and air traffic, and airport 
infrastructure ages. At the same time, the PFC has been capped at 1990s 
levels and loses value each year to inflation. I strongly urge your 
committee to increase the PFC to fairly and efficiently meet these 
funding needs.
    If changes cannot be made to the PFC, I encourage you to look at 
addressing airport funding by building on the success of the Airport 
Terminal Program. The ATP's broad scope has allowed airports to address 
a variety of neglected projects, and this model is proving to be a good 
alternative to a higher PFC. The Airport Improvement Program could be 
expanded to more closely resemble the ATP, or the ATP can be formally 
authorized. In any scenario, it is crucial that additional funds are 
authorized for these programs to support airport infrastructure.
    Finally, I am encouraged by recent initiatives to provide regional 
connections to hub airports with ground transportation. Like a 
connecting flight, passengers on these ground connections are ticketed 
through the airlines, board their ground service through their 
departing airport, and arrive at their connecting airport. However, 
passengers on these ground connections are not considered enplanements 
for the purpose of calculating an airport's entitlement funding through 
the AIP, despite the otherwise analogous use of airport facilities. As 
this business model evolves, I ask that you consider changes to the 
definition of enplanement to create parity between regional ground and 
air carriers.

                                 
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Janice D. Schakowsky, a Representative in 
                  Congress From the State of Illinois
    Dear Chairs Graves and Graves, and Ranking Members Larsen and 
Cohen:
    As the Member of Congress representing the 9th Congressional 
District of Illinois, I am privileged to represent almost twenty 
municipalities along the north and northwest suburbs of Chicago. 
Several of these communities lie close to O'Hare International Airport. 
As a major economic hub, O'Hare sees thousands of aircraft movements 
daily. Though O'Hare is essential to our community, urge you to end the 
special regulatory treatment that has shielded airlines from 
accountability for their harmful treatment of passengers nationwide. in 
the upcoming Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization. It 
is high time that we address the disastrous airline deregulation 
policies that have caused anticompetitive consolidation in the 
industry, predatory behavior by airlines targeting consumers, and 
excessive aircraft noise.
    Since the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act in 1978, the 
airline industry has consolidated from more than 20 major airlines into 
6 large nationwide carriers. These mergers harm competition, resulting 
in less choice and higher prices for consumers. Residents of smaller 
cities have suffered disproportionately, as airlines reduced flights in 
places like Providence, Memphis, and Cleveland, while also raising 
prices and hiring less workers, further hurting the economy of these 
regions.
    This past summer and holiday season, countless Americans had their 
flights delayed or cancelled entirely. Flight cancellations are the 
highest they have been in more than a decade, and consumer complaints 
spiked by 375% in October 2022 compared to 2019.\1\ In addition to 
flight cancelations and delays, consumers experience issues with 
receiving fair refunds, lost luggage that is sometimes irretrievable, 
accessibility on flights for those with disabilities, and junk fees 
that separate families.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We must hold airlines accountable for the harm they cause 
passengers: the missed life events; time separated from loved ones; and 
the stress of navigating a travel system that is leaving consumers high 
and dry. It should be unlawful for airlines to sell tickets or delay or 
cancel flights when the airlines know in advance that they do not have 
the staff to deliver the promised service. We must also put antitrust 
enforcers back on the beat by empowering the Federal Trade Commission 
and state attorneys general to enforce antitrust and consumer 
protection laws in these markets to end predatory behavior by the 
airlines. That's exactly what my bill from last Congress with my 
colleague Rep. Cicilline does, the ``Ensuring Friendly Skies for 
Passengers Act.'' \2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    More fundamentally, we must change incentives for airlines. Instead 
of mergers and share buybacks, the airline industry should have to 
compete and invest in workers and improvements to passenger experience. 
Instead of hollowing out capacity, airlines should have to end 
operational meltdowns, restore stability, and ensure adequate staffing 
to relieve overworked employees.
    The high volume of aircraft activity into and out of O'Hare also 
has notable negative effects on surrounding communities. Many residents 
of suburbs including Park Ridge, Mount Prospect, Niles, and others must 
deal with substantial noise, depending on runway utilization. The noise 
can impact quality of life--interrupting school days for children, 
restful sleep, and everyday life events. Absent continued action, the 
type of problems facing residents in surrounding communities will only 
get worse.
    I am a longtime member of the Quiet Skies Caucus and have been 
actively advocating for solutions. While significant steps have been 
taken over the last decades, it is clear that additional work is needed 
to protect consumers and their quality of life. I regularly receive 
calls and emails from harmed constituents. For example, Robert from 
Park Ridge lamented that he and his family cannot open their windows, 
enjoy their backyard, or have phone conversations due to flight noise. 
In fact, Robert's noise detector is ``registering over 85 decibels'' 
which is over the E.P.A.'s 70-db recommendation. Mary from Chicago 
shared that at the end of her flight, her power chair mobility aid 
``arrived in five parts.'' It is clear that the FAA reauthorization 
affects all Americans--and it is our duty to serve them.
    The FAA's most recent Neighborhood Environmental Survey report 
demonstrates that the Day-Night Sound Level (DNL) and corresponding 
Schultz Curve created in the 1970s have outlived their usefulness. The 
FAA must adapt its noise metrics to ensure accuracy and create 
regulations and programs that actually address aircraft noise. That 
includes FAA engagement with community members and groups to gauge 
aircraft noise impacts and to reduce negative effects on our 
constituents.
    I am thankful for the committee's work on these issues, and I 
strongly urge you to continue pushing for viable solutions to the 
consumer protection and noise issues plaguing my constituents at 
O'Hare, other major air hubs throughout the nation, and all of the 
nation's flying public.

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Adam B. Schiff, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of California
    Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, I rise today to applaud 
the historic investments in the future of our nation's transportation 
and infrastructure systems that Congress helped passed through the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. I look forward to helping facilitate a 
thorough--and equitable--implementation of the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and I urge us to continue to 
build on these historic investments. As these funds go out, we should 
insist on prevailing wages, the use of local labor, and project labor 
agreements to ensure that the work is done well and workers are 
properly compensated.
    Throughout the state of California and across the country, critical 
investments in our transportation and infrastructure are creating 
pathways for safer and more efficient travel, high-paying union jobs, a 
cleaner and greener future, and long-term economic growth and 
stability. As we preserve, repair, and rebuild American roads and 
bridges, airports, and water systems, we must also expand on them with 
the creation of pedestrian safety enhancements and bike lanes, expanded 
electric vehicle charging systems, programs to provide access to clean 
water, access to airport funding, and opportunities for more efficient 
and greener bus transit, public rail, and high-speed rail systems.
    As this Committee considers its legislative priorities for this 
Congress, including Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
Reauthorization, I ask that you prioritize addressing issues that 
Californians face every day. Like many communities, my constituents 
live with a disruptive amount of aviation noise, which has steadily 
increased in recent years. My district is home to some of the most 
unique cultural and entertainment sites in Southern California, as well 
as the Hollywood Burbank Airport. I have been committed to community-
led efforts to mitigate disruptive airplane and helicopter noise for 
communities living along flight paths near these attractions. My 
colleagues and I have extensively studied these issues and have 
diligently listened to community input. Communities have asked for the 
FAA to establish and sustain effective methods to measure, track, and 
investigate aircraft noise, aircraft noise complaints, and the 
environmental impact of aircraft noise and noise pollution. And to take 
meaningful action to address it.
    Many residents who live near Hollywood Burbank Airport, and other 
airports across the state, continue to experience disruptive noise from 
flights, particularly at night. I continue to ask Congress to authorize 
the FAA to lead community roundtables to address noise issues and urge 
this body to implement accountability measures for communities who have 
been overlooked by the FAA. Additionally, I support a mandatory 
nighttime curfew for Hollywood Burbank Airport so that Burbank and Los 
Angeles residents can sleep peacefully.
    I urge the Committee to reauthorize FAA funding for noise complaint 
systems and improve its mechanisms. Furthermore, frequent helicopter 
noise is a burden for many Angelenos. I urge this body to include 
provisions to regulate helicopter traffic over residential 
neighborhoods and ensure that helicopter noise and traffic are taken 
into consideration in any efforts for aviation noise mitigation.
    I support a robust FAA Reauthorization bill that will benefit the 
Hollywood Burbank Airport, the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport 
Authority, airport workers, local anti-noise coalitions and activists, 
and all constituents in my district, including increased modernization 
funding for both large and regional airports. I support policies that 
will encourage pilot, passenger, and aviation crew safety--including 
secondary barriers on commercial aircraft and other safety measures to 
protect pilots and in-flight aircraft crew. I support strengthening 
consumer protections and holding airlines accountable for mass flight 
cancellations, shrinking airline seat sizes, and junk fees--and I 
support ensuring that flying is more accessible for underserved 
communities and people with disabilities. Lastly, I support innovative 
and equitable solutions to our workforce shortage, including 
programming and funding to expand and diversify the pipeline for 
aviation professionals and strengthening labor standards and pay for 
industry workers.
    These investments will not only improve Californians' quality of 
life but will also keep America competitive in the global economy. I 
look forward to continuing to work to facilitate the transition to a 
cleaner transportation and infrastructure sector for years to come. I 
applaud the Committee's efforts to produce a strong, bipartisan FAA 
Reauthorization bill and hope we can pass this crucial legislation in a 
timely matter to help families, workers, and communities across the 
nation.

                                 
  Prepared Statement of Hon. Adam Smith, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of Washington
    Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
    Thank you for the opportunity to share my priorities for FAA 
Reauthorization this year. I encourage the Committee to include 
provisions that help address aviation noise and emissions that impact 
many communities surrounding airports. As a member of Congress whose 
district is home to one of the busiest and fastest-growing airport hubs 
in the country, Sea-Tac International Airport, I know the importance of 
the aviation system for jobs and the economy. However, I have also seen 
first-hand the impacts of aviation noise and emissions on the 
environment, health, and quality of life of these communities.
    I believe that we should treat the impact of aviation noise and 
emissions as environmental justice and health issues. The impact of 
noise and emissions disproportionally impacts low-income communities, 
communities of color, and vulnerable populations. These communities are 
often already facing greater risks and impacts from poor air quality 
and other environmental and health hazards. I continue to encourage the 
FAA to reevaluate its selection of noise measurement methodologies, 
health impact thresholds, and abatement program effectiveness and 
requiring them to consider the impact on human health and environment 
when determining airport capacity and approving new flight routes. The 
hope this FAA Reauthorization we can continue to push the FAA to do 
better in these areas.
    Community engagement should be the centerpiece of our response to 
aviation noise and emissions. While meaningful changes were included in 
the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, many of these changes have not 
been implemented in a timely fashion or at all. And some of the changes 
that have been implemented, such as the FAA's Ombudsman Office, have 
not taken meaningful action in addressing constituent and community 
concerns. FAA engagement with community members has been woefully 
insufficient. I believe we can and must do more to ensure that the 
FAA's approach to community engagement on these issues is more robust, 
inclusive, and responsive to all community members.
    I have recently reintroduced legislation that I first offered in 
the 115th Congress to improve the manner in which the FAA engages with 
noise-affected areas. The Aviation Impacted Communities Act seeks to 
help cities, localities, and neighborhoods to better and more 
productively engage with the FAA. The legislation is geared 
particularly towards communities that have not been recognized as 
``impacted'' by the FAA's noise standard. It would require that the FAA 
interface directly with and be responsive to residents and locally 
nominated leaders on issues of aviation noise and environmental 
impacts. Through the creation of local community boards, affected areas 
will be empowered to more effectively work toward achieving relief from 
the impacts of civil and commercial aviation.
    More work needs to be done to ensure greater access to the FAA's 
Airport Improvement Program (AIP) for noise insulation. Many airports 
have opted to use the AIP fund to pay for noise mitigation, however, 
there are many limits on the program, including barring the use of AIP 
funds on the same home or structure twice. This regulation prevents 
airports from ever replacing or repairing sound insulation if the 
products become defective or cause problems for the homeowner. 
Airports, including Sea-Tac, that started noise insulation projects in 
the 1980's and 1990's often did not have access to high quality 
materials, and in some cases, contractors installed sound insulation 
without proper ventilation or structural supports, causing structural 
damage, mold, and other problems. It is incredibly expensive for 
homeowners to replace or repair the sound insulation, especially for 
lower income homeowners, leaving many individuals and families with 
deteriorating or molded structures in their homes. I recently 
introduced the Sound Insulation Treatment Repair and Replacement 
Program Act with Senator Murray to help address this issue. It would 
establish a process by which airports may apply for additional AIP 
funding to repair or replace noise mitigation packages. I urge the 
inclusion of this bicameral legislation in the Reauthorization.
    In addition to noise impacts from aviation, particulate matter, 
ultrafine particles (UFPs), and other pollutants pose an outsize threat 
to those living near airports and under flight pathways. UFP pollutants 
are minuscule particles of less than one hundred nanometers in size 
that are emitted as byproducts of petroleum fuel combustion in engines, 
such as those used on vehicles and aircraft. Studies have demonstrated 
that communities near airports and under airflight pathways are exposed 
to higher proportions of pollution and harmful particles from aviation 
emissions. This can lead to increased risks of breast cancer, heart 
disease, birth defects, asthma, and a variety of other lung and 
cardiovascular conditions that impact adults and children. These 
additional risks are on top of the many other environmental and health 
hazards disproportionately impacting low-income communities and 
communities of color.
    I recently reintroduced the Protecting Airport Communities from 
Particle Emissions Act to address this issue. This legislation would 
require the FAA to work with the Environmental Protection Agency to 
conduct a national study of UFPs. With more extensive research, we will 
be able to properly regulate ultrafine particulate and help ensure that 
individuals and families living near aviation hubs are protected from 
the worst health implications of aviation emissions.
    I believe a fundamental problem with our current response to 
aviation noise and emissions at the federal level is that it is almost 
entirely led by the FAA. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and 
Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) should play a much more 
active role in addressing this challenge as an environmental and health 
issue. That is why I strongly support the reestablishment of the EPA's 
Office of Noise Abatement and Control and additional actions by the EPA 
and HHS to increase their engagement in affected communities.
    I recently worked with impacted community members and organizations 
in my district to introduce the Aviation Noise and Emissions Mitigation 
Act. This legislation creates two new pilot grant programs at the EPA, 
in coordination with the FAA and HHS, for hyperlocal studies of air 
quality and noise impacts and for mitigation programs in communities. 
The bill will help us to better understand the effects of noise and 
emissions and fund initiatives driven by impacted communities to 
mitigate the effects on the environment, public health, and quality of 
life of residents.
    As the aviation sector has grown, with more people flying more 
frequently, significant investments have been put toward airport 
infrastructure. We need to make similar investments in communities that 
feel the negative effects of aviation. This means not only investing in 
new technologies to reduce air travel emissions and expanding other 
forms of zero-emissions travel, but also directing funding to the 
communities disproportionately impacted by aviation. Residents living 
in aviation-impacted communities cannot wait any longer for relief from 
the public-health consequences of exposure to high concentrations of 
pollutants and high levels of aviation noise. Congress and the federal 
government must establish new programs to better measure the 
environmental and public-health consequences of exposure to high levels 
of noise and emissions and invest in resources to reduce those impacts 
on these communities. Millions of Americans who live near aviation 
hubs--like my constituents in the 9th District--deserve nothing less.
    I appreciate your consideration of these requests and look forward 
to working with you on advancing an FAA reauthorization bill this year.

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Eric Sorensen, a Representative in Congress 
                       From the State of Illinois
    I want to begin by thanking Chairman Graves and Ranking Member 
Larsen for convening this hearing and for welcoming member testimony as 
they craft this important legislation, the 2023 FAA Reauthorization 
bill.
    I am proud to represent the 17th district of Illinois. My district 
is home to four airports, including one contract tower and one of the 
fastest growing cargo airports in the country.
    Chicago Rockford International Airport is home to 8,000 jobs and 
contributes $4.7 billion to the economy in 2020. Central Illinois 
Regional Airport at Bloomington-Normal is home to more than 1,300 jobs. 
Quad Cities International Airport is home to 1,389 jobs in 2017. Peoria 
International Airport is home to 26 direct employees and many 
contractors. Combined, these four airports support over 10,600 jobs and 
contribute billions of dollars to the economy.
    I would like to highlight some general priorities. First, I would 
like to express support for the Voluntary Airport Low Emissions Program 
(VALE) and Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) and Infrastructure Pilot 
Program programs. The VALE program assists airports to meet the air 
quality goals set under the Clean Air Act. The ZEV and Infrastructure 
Pilot program improves airport air quality and facilities use of zero 
emissions technologies at airports.
    Second, I would like to express support for the expanded 
availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as well as assistance 
for airports to invest in the infrastructure needed to support the 
broader adaption and use of SAF.
    Third, my district is home to one of the six FAA contract towers in 
Illinois. This program ensures airport and aircraft users in my 
district receive critical air traffic control services which keep the 
traveling public safe. In recent weeks and months, there have been 
several ``near miss'' incidents throughout the country. These incidents 
show how important our air traffic controllers are to the safety of the 
American aviation system. I would like to express robust support for 
the Contract Tower Program. This program helps support airports 
throughout the country--big and small--as well as safeguarding our 
aviation system and maintaining the stellar safety record the United 
States enjoys.
    Relatedly, I would like to express support for the continued 
development of air traffic controllers at airports throughout the 
country. The shortage of these highly skilled men and women challenges 
our aviation system every day. On average, air traffic control staffing 
is at 81% of full capacity. As a result, FAA has called for airlines to 
reduce their summer flight schedules in order to bring flight numbers 
down to a number FAA can support with the current numbers of air 
traffic controllers. I think we can all agree that a robust air traffic 
control program with full staffing is imperative for the continued 
safety and operation of the American aviation system.
    I thank the committee for the opportunity to testify on these 
important issues.

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Eric Swalwell, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of California
    Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, thank you for the 
opportunity to share my thoughts as the committee develops 
reauthorizing legislation for the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA), Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, United 
States Coast Guard, and others affecting our infrastructure and supply 
chain.
    I want to highlight an issue that I am especially passionate 
about--protecting those who protect us when we travel. Pilots, flight 
crew, and flight attendants are some of the hardest working Americans 
in this country. This is especially the case as they navigated pre- and 
post-pandemic travel, often prioritizing our right to travel over their 
own health and safety. That is why we must ensure that they are 
protected from unprovoked violence at the hands of unruly passengers.
    My bicameral and bipartisan legislation, the Protection from 
Abusive Passengers Act, achieves this goal by limiting especially 
violent passengers from placing pilots, flight crew, flight attendants, 
and the traveling public in serious danger. The premise of the 
legislation is simple: if you commit violence in our skies, you will 
not fly.
    In 2022 alone, the FAA investigated 831 unruly-passenger incidents 
stemming from over 2,400 reports of violence in our skies, an almost 
600% increase from just a few years ago. The FAA and Department of 
Justice (DOJ) have taken important steps, from increasing civil fines, 
to prioritizing prosecutions for assaults against flight crew and 
attendants. Yet, even when a passenger is fined or convicted, it does 
not prevent the offender from flying. There must be clear uniform 
safety standards that protect all flight crew, flight attendants, and 
the traveling public when unacceptable violent behavior occurs in 
flight.
    My legislation would ensure that those who assault aircraft crew 
cannot continue to endanger others by directing TSA to oversee a 
program which bars passengers after they are fined or convicted of 
serious physical violence. The bill would also permanently ban abusive 
passengers from participating in the TSA PreCheck or Customs' Global 
Entry programs.
    Increased transparency and notice will be provided to banned 
individuals, including guidelines for removal and opportunities for 
appeal. This includes requirements that passengers receive advanced 
notice of the program's requirements, rules, and procedures in line 
with existing due process rights that are afforded to any individual 
facing an adjudicative penalty. Other safeguards will be provided to 
individuals who are erroneously added to the no-fly list, as well as a 
study to ensure that the program is working as intended so that no 
race, ethnicity, or other protected class is unfairly targeted.
    To be clear, no passenger will ever be referred to this no-fly list 
unless and until they are first provided with the opportunity to be 
heard during a criminal prosecution by the DOJ, or a civil action 
initiated by the FAA. Our process would provide passengers with ample 
opportunities for legal representation and notice, including a court-
appointed lawyer in all criminal prosecutions.
    In summary, the Protection from Abusive Passengers Act safeguards 
flight crew while implementing a transparent and accountable TSA 
process that will limit serious sexual and physical abusers from 
endangering commercial flights.
    Flight attendants, pilots, and other essential airline workers are 
first responders in the sky and critical to passenger safety and 
security. Unruly passenger events divert attention away from this 
primary function and add unnecessary risk into our national airspace. 
Aviation workers should never have to seek protection from abusive 
passengers. They deserve a safe work environment so they can focus on 
the safety and security of the traveling public.
    I am proud that the Protection from Abusive Passengers Act is 
supported by the Air Line Pilots Association; Association of Flight 
Attendants, CWA; Association of Professional Flight Attendants; 
Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO; Transportation Trades 
Department, AFL-CIO; Communications Workers of America (CWA); American 
Airlines; Delta Air Lines; and Southwest Airlines.
    I respectfully ask that my bipartisan legislation be included in 
any reauthorizing package the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure will consider this Congress to send a strong message 
that Democrats and Republicans alike will adopt a zero-tolerance policy 
towards violent behavior in our skies. I look forward to working with 
the Chairman and Ranking Member to move this priority forward. Thank 
you for your consideration.

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Rashida Tlaib, a Representative in Congress 
                       From the State of Michigan
    Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
    Thank you for the opportunity to share written testimony as the 
Committee works to reauthorize various transportation programs vital to 
our communities.
       PHMSA Field Operations and Hazardous Materials Enforcement
    In the aftermath of the East Palestine, Ohio rail disaster, there 
is rightfully more focus than ever on the transportation of hazardous 
materials.
    In Detroit, the 94-year-old Ambassador Bridge spans the Detroit 
River and connects the U.S. to Windsor, Ontario, Canada. About 20% of 
our nation's trade with Canada crosses this bridge every year. The 
bridge is privately owned by the Detroit International Bridge Company, 
which has a long history of illegal activity and disregard for safety 
rules and regulations. The longtime owner of that company was even 
jailed and held in contempt for not following court orders. In recent 
years the company has unsuccessfully sought permission from the State 
of Michigan to transport new classes of hazardous materials across the 
Bridge. It is important to note that the Bridge is located upstream of 
municipal drinking water intakes. The bridge is too old, too narrow, 
and lacks proper firefighting and other hazard mitigations.
    Recently, claims have been made that prohibited hazardous materials 
are nonetheless traveling across the Bridge without proper 
authorization. For instance, the Detroit Windsor Truck Ferry, which is 
permitted to transport those restricted hazmat classes, transported 
only 3,838 restricted hazmat loads last year when in prior years it 
routinely transported more than 10,000. My residents deserve to know 
where hazmat is traveling and how. I have already requested PHMSA 
investigate this situation.
    However, the federal agencies in charge of enforcing hazardous 
materials regulations--which include Customs and Border Patrol and 
PHMSA--lack the resources for aggressive enforcement that safeguards 
public health. I encourage the Committee to provide the highest 
possible funding for PHMSA's Hazardous Materials Field Operations so 
that it can provide proper and timely compliance inspections on the 
Ambassador Bridge and others like it.
    Moreover, Michigan is home to numerous oil and natural gas 
pipelines and has already suffered one of the worst inland oil spills 
in our nation's history when Enbridge's Line 6B dumped a million 
gallons of heavy crude oil into the Kalamazoo River. As Enbridge 
continues to violate State law by operating its Line 5 pipeline through 
the Straits of Mackinac in the Great Lakes, the importance of pipeline 
inspections and enforcement cannot be overstated. I urge the Committee 
to provide the highest possible level of funding for PHMSA's Pipeline 
Field Operations.
                          FAA Noise Mitigation
    Michigan's 12th District is home to many communities within close 
proximity to the Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW), and many of our 
residents are burdened by the air and noise pollution that comes with 
living under flight paths. I encourage the Committee to provide the 
highest possible level of funding for the Federal Aviation 
Administration's Airport Noise Compatibility Planning, or Part 150. 
Robust funding for Part 150 will allow DTW and airports like it across 
the country to update their noise mitigation plans more frequently to 
adjust to changing weather patterns, airline trends, and in DTW's case, 
the Cleveland/Detroit Metroplex Project. This in turn will better 
protect our residents from pollution and disruptions to their everyday 
lives and will help local governments respond to resident concerns.
           WRDA Flooding Prevention and Environmental Justice
    As I shared with this Committee last year, Southeast Michigan has 
been inundated by historic flooding in recent years. As these 
catastrophic weather events increase in ferocity and frequency, our 
communities need the tools to be prepared. This year's WRDA presents an 
opportunity for my neighbors to better understand the threats that we 
face due to climate change, and to be equipped with resilient, modern 
water infrastructure. First, I encourage the Committee to offer support 
to the Detroit Division of the Army Corps of Engineers in planning and 
identifying flood resilience for communities along Ecorse Creek. I also 
encourage the Army Corps to conduct a feasibility study for flood risk 
management in Southeast Michigan. Third, I encourage the Committee to 
broaden environmental assistance for Michigan by committing $35 million 
dollars for projects like wastewater treatment, water supply, 
environmental restoration, and surface water resource protection.
    Finally, I encourage the Committee to truly incorporate environment 
justice into this year's WRDA bill. We should increase capacity and 
expertise within Army Corps and give the public more meaningful 
opportunities to weigh in on the projects that affect their 
communities. We should continue increasing opportunities for assistance 
by expanding the Pilot Program for Economically Disadvantaged 
Communities. Finally, we must maximize toxic remediation in ecological 
restoration, navigation and flood resilience projects; we must support 
minority-owned businesses; and we must continue developing and 
advancing environmental justice innovation.
    I appreciate the opportunity to share my priorities with the 
Committee and ask that you consider funding these important programs as 
you develop reauthorizations this year.

                                 
    Prepared Statement of Hon. Norma J. Torres, a Representative in 
                 Congress From the State of California
    Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, distinguished members of 
the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony 
today. It is good to be back in the House Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee to discuss the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) reauthorization and transportation needs of the Inland Empire.
    I represent California's 35th Congressional District that includes 
Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties.
    The Ontario International Airport (ONT) and Chino Airport are in my 
district, and ONT is one of the top air cargo airports of the United 
States.
    I travel often from Washington, D.C. to Ontario International 
Airport since that is the most accessible airport in my region for 
domestic and international travel.
    As I mentioned, Ontario International Airport is a top air cargo 
airport and to support them I would like to work closely with the FAA 
to conduct a pilot program and study of the resources and tools most 
effective for FAA to support airports that are recognized as Inland 
Ports or are transitioning to be Inland Ports. I believe funding for 
airports that are transitioning to becoming Inland Ports is important, 
as they are crucial to having a successful and sustainable supply 
chain.
    To support our airports, we must increase funding for the Airport 
Improvement Program to a minimum of $4 billion annually. This program 
is essential for airports to meet growing infrastructure needs as the 
FAA reiterated in its most recent National Plan of Integrated Airport 
Systems report.
    Additionally, as we support our airports, we must also invest in 
technology and resources that combat air pollution in economically 
disadvantaged communities, which causes devastating health 
consequences, such as asthma in children.
    Historically, the Inland Empire is ranked as having the worst air 
pollution in the United States. In April, the American Lung Association 
(ALA) released its annual State of the Air Report. Once again San 
Bernardino and Riverside Counties ranked first and second respectively 
for the worst ozone pollution in the United States. The two counties 
also ranked in the top ten for the worst annual particle pollution 
nationally, according to the report. As stated by the National 
Institute of Health, studies have shown that ultrafine particulate 
matter (UFP) is elevated in and around airports. As a center of 
industrial activity, coupled with unique geographic features and 
congestion, the area has too many air pollutants. Airports are among 
the largest sources of air pollution in the United States, and we must 
use the FAA Reauthorization as a vehicle to combat the air pollution 
that is affecting surrounding communities.
    Also, millions of Americans are subject to aircraft noise, and it 
is a constant source of consternation whether they live near an airport 
or under a regular flight path. Some constituents bear a significant 
aircraft noise burden from nearby Ontario International Airport. There 
are already numerous complaints from residents in my community about 
the loud jet engine noise they are subjected to daily, even at very 
late or early hours of the day. We must invest in sound insulation 
programs to reduce aircraft-related noise levels inside homes by 
installing sound insulated doors and windows. This would offer my 
constituents the ability to protect themselves and their families from 
aircraft noise, especially if an individual suffers from a condition 
that is triggered by loud noises.
    Furthermore, airlines and the aviation industry have been hit hard 
by a shortage of pilots and other necessary staff as well as dealing 
with outdated technology. There is a deficit of about 8,000 pilots, or 
11% of the total workforce, and the shortfall could reach 30,000 pilots 
by 2025. There will be a projected global demand for 610,000 civil 
aviation Aircraft Maintenance Technicians over the next 20 years. In 
the FAA Reauthorization, we must work to address the aviation labor 
shortage, or the entire industry will falter. If the industry falters, 
consumers who rely on air travel will see more flight delays, in-flight 
issues, or cancellations. We must invest in programs, like the aviation 
maintenance technician development program and the aviation workforce 
development program, to increase the strength and number of aviation 
professionals who are well-trained and can be relied upon to make air 
travel safe and efficient.
    Additionally, as we think about our aviation workforce, we must 
also remember the firefighters that respond to emergencies at our local 
airports. The FAA must collaborate with stakeholders to develop a 
national transition plan to assist airports in moving to fluorine-free 
firefighting foams. Fluorine is a synthetic-based foam that contains 
fluorinated and hydrocarbon-based surfactants, including perfluoroalkyl 
or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Working with this foam negatively 
impacts our firefighters and increases their risks of developing health 
issues, like cancer, if they keep handling PFAS. There must be funding 
for an acquisition program for the new foam and a disposal program for 
the fluorine-laced foam, and PFAS remediation at airports.
    The FAA Reauthorization is an important step in addressing air 
pollution, aircraft noise, aviation workforce shortages, and PFAS.
    In addition, the Inland Empire is often overlooked when it comes to 
transportation funding and resources. As a member of the THUD 
Subcommittee on the House Appropriations Committee, I have worked to 
advance priorities that include transportation funding equity metrics.
    I would welcome the opportunity to work with your committee to 
continue to advance equity metrics for transportation funding, 
advancing the Regional Infrastructure Accelerator, fostering Thriving 
Communities, expanding transit-oriented development, focusing on air 
quality and traffic congestion, and protecting pedestrians from 
automobile accidents. Regional Infrastructure Accelerators are 
important in assisting local governments in developing improved 
regional infrastructure priorities and financing strategies for the 
accelerated development of projects. Thriving Communities is an 
essential program that fosters equitable economic growth, reduces 
transportation cost-burden, improves public health and mobility, and 
increases access to economic opportunity. This investment aims to 
provide in-depth, hands-on technical assistance resulting in at least 
one community-led infrastructure project per State and territories. 
Expanding transit-oriented development will bridge the nexus of 
ensuring there is accessible public transit, affordable housing, and 
jobs in a community. The worst air quality in the nation is often 
around vulnerable communities who are suffering the impacts of climate 
change. As you know, airports are often important hubs for transit. We 
must focus on ensuring transit options in the areas of the country with 
the worst air quality.
    Moreover, we need to provide adequate funding to increase 
pedestrian safety around airports. I have a staffer that recovered from 
getting hit by an automobile as a pedestrian, and I know how this 
affects our communities. For example, in 2020 there were 6,516 
pedestrians killed in traffic crashes, a 3.9-percent increase from the 
6,272 pedestrian fatalities in 2019. On average, a pedestrian was 
injured every 10 minutes in traffic crashes in 2020. Pedestrian deaths 
accounted for 17 percent of all traffic fatalities and 2 percent of all 
people injured in traffic crashes in 2020. This reauthorization should 
include language that will help our states address rising pedestrian 
accidents.
    Finally, the FAA can establish a direct route from DCA to ONT. This 
would provide a more accessible option to the residents of the Inland 
Empire.
    These issues are all of importance to my community and I hope to 
work with you to create legislation that finds solutions.
    Again, I thank the Committee for the opportunity to provide 
testimony.

                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. David J. Trone, a Representative in Congress 
                       From the State of Maryland
    Thank you, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and members of 
the Committee, for the opportunity to offer testimony on issues of 
importance to our constituents as you work on the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) Reauthorization legislation.
    Drug overdoses impact every community. Overdoses contribute to the 
premature deaths of, now, over 100,000 Americans every year. That is 
over 250 people per day, leaving millions of loved ones grieving. 
Overdoses are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18-45. 
Nonfatal overdoses from opioids are even more common, with over 181,000 
occurring in the United States last year. As the Co-Founder and Co-
Chair of the Bipartisan Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Task 
Force, combating the overdose epidemic has been my top priority since 
coming to Congress.
    More and more of these tragic overdoses are happening in public, 
including on air travel. I commend the FAA for working with the 
Aerospace Medical Association (AsMA) to review the contents of the 
Emergency Medical Kits as directed through H.R. 302, the FAA 
Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254). As a part of the 
recommendations laid forth by AsMA, an opioid antagonist was 
recommended as an addition to the contents of aircraft Emergency 
Medical Kits. While I applaud the efforts of the FAA to encourage all 
airlines to voluntarily carry naloxone as part of the lifesaving kits 
on aircraft, I remain concerned that flight crews are not adequately 
prepared with the tools and training to respond to opioid overdoses. I 
believe we need a stronger approach to ensure every flight is equipped 
with lifesaving medication.
    While many people who experience an overdose knowingly use illicit 
opioids, others overdose after consuming counterfeit pills or other 
drugs that they believed to be opioid-free, like Adderall or Xanax. In 
February 2023, the Los Angeles Times reported fentanyl-laced 
counterfeit pills being dispensed by state-regulated pharmacies in 
Mexico. In fact, over 70% of the pills analyzed in popular tourist 
destinations (Tijuana, Cabo San Lucas, and San Jose del Cabo) tested 
positive for illicit drugs. With nearly 12 million Americans visiting 
Mexico every year, these counterfeit pills pose a clear threat to 
American lives--we must respond deliberately and urgently to ensure 
Americans are able to return home safely.
    Therefore, I encourage the Committee to require lifesaving opioid 
overdose reversal medication on all domestic and international flights 
in the United States.
    Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to working with 
you to ensure that the FAA Reauthorization provides for emergency 
medical kits which reflect our priorities and needs as a nation.

                                 
    Prepared Statement of Hon. Jennifer Wexton, a Representative in 
               Congress From the Commonwealth of Virginia
    Thank you, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and members of 
the Committee, for holding this Member Day hearing and for allowing 
members to share their priorities with the Committee. My testimony 
today lays out the priorities of Virginia's 10th Congressional District 
for the Committee's work on reauthorization of the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) this year.
    Virginia's 10th Congressional District is home to a significant 
number of FAA assets, including three air traffic control towers at 
Dulles International Airport, Leesburg Executive Airport, and Manassas 
Regional Airport, the Potomac Terminal Radar Approach Control facility 
in Warrenton, the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center in 
Leesburg, and the Air Traffic Control System Command Center in 
Warrenton. I am proud to represent each of these facilities and the 
thousands of FAA employees and aviation industry workers who work 
tirelessly to move passengers and freight safely and efficiently 
throughout the national airspace every day.
               Perimeter Rule at Reagan National Airport
    First and foremost, I urge the Committee in the strongest possible 
terms to avoid making any additional statutory exemptions to the 
current Perimeter Rule at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport 
(DCA). As you know, Congress must propose and approve legislation to 
allow ``beyond perimeter'' exemptions for operations between DCA and 
cities outside of the current 1,250-mile perimeter.
    The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority manages a two-
airport system of DCA and Dulles International Airport (IAD) that is 
organized to make DCA a short-haul airport, handling non-stop flights 
within the existing perimeter of the airport, and IAD the airport for 
longer flights, as it is equipped with the infrastructure to 
accommodate long-distance flights and their larger aircraft. Relaxing 
or eroding the current perimeter historically has prompted long-
distance domestic flights to shift from IAD to DCA. Each time Congress 
has expanded the perimeter, it has:
    (1)  increased enplaning and deplaning passengers at an already 
overcrowded DCA;
    (2)  increased noise over the densely populated areas neighboring 
DCA;
    (3)  further strained DCA's limited facilities, including, but not 
limited to, baggage handling systems and claim areas, gates, ticket 
counters, parking, and concessions;
    (4)  increased traffic on DCA's already congested roadways; and
    (5)  caused the overuse of runways and other airside facilities, 
which can exacerbate flight delays.

    Beyond the harm caused to DCA, further relaxation of the perimeter 
would cause smaller inside-perimeter markets to lose air service to the 
National Capital Region, as airlines are likely to replace those 
destinations with more lucrative long-haul routes currently served by 
IAD. Furthermore, DCA would lose many of the advantages that currently 
make it a popular destination for passengers because of the increased 
maintenance required to operate under the additional strain.
    Beyond the impact to passengers, shifting long-haul flights from 
IAD to DCA would have the unintended consequence of impacting the 
regional economy. Creating an imbalance between the airports in favor 
of increased traffic at DCA increases the IAD cost-per-enplanement, 
resulting in airlines diverting more flights and passengers away from 
the airport. This has the potential to trigger a vicious cycle of 
business decline that will ripple through the National Capital Region 
as domestic flight destinations decrease at IAD.
    Erosion of the perimeter also impacts international travel at IAD, 
as international airlines and passengers depend upon the convenience of 
domestic connections. If access to desirable domestic connecting 
flights disappears, international air carriers are likely to move their 
IAD-based flights to airports in cities that can offer more domestic 
connections. A reduction of international air service to the National 
Capital Region risks diminishing Washington's status as a global 
business center and gateway destination, damaging the substantial 
economic growth that is directly attributable to IAD's strong 
development of international service.
    Overall, losing the perimeter and its regulatory role is bad for 
the National Capital Region's economy, bad for smaller domestic air 
markets, and bad for international air service. Losing the perimeter 
would over-stress one federal asset and leave another underutilized due 
to shifting flights and passengers from the larger IAD, which is 
designed to handle them, to the smaller DCA, which isn't.
                    Air Traffic Controller Workforce
    Additionally, as you well know, the FAA is facing significant 
workforce challenges, especially in terms of hiring and training new 
controllers to meet the nationwide demand for their services. There are 
1,200 fewer fully certified controllers than there were a decade ago, 
and we are already seeing the effects of staffing shortages in the 
national airspace. These include flight delays, cancellations, and the 
recently published final rule ``Staffing Related Relief Concerning 
Operations at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, John F. 
Kennedy International Airport, LaGuardia Airport, and Newark Liberty 
International Airport, May 15, 2023, Through September 15, 2023'', 
which would reduce operations at the three named airports during the 
summer of 2023 and impact the airports' abilities to meet the demands 
of their communities and customers.
    I am pleased to see that addressing these challenges is a priority 
of the Committee in its reauthorization work and ensuring that the FAA 
is using accurate staffing data to set hiring and staffing targets will 
be essential to doing so. I urge the Committee to include the following 
legislative language to incorporate the staffing targets determined by 
the Collaborative Resources Workgroup in the FAA's report to Congress 
on air traffic controller staffing:

        Amend title 49 United States Code section 44506(e) by inserting 
        in subparagraph (1) ``Collaborative Resource Workgroup (CRWG)'' 
        after ``The'' and before ``staffing standards'' and by 
        inserting ``fully certified'' after ``of'' and before ``air 
        traffic controllers needed'', and inserting after subparagraph 
        (1) a new subparagraph (2): ``for each air traffic control 
        facility operated by the FAA: the current certified 
        professional controller staffing levels; the CRWG operational 
        staffing targets for certified professional controllers; the 
        anticipated certified professional controller attrition for 
        each of the next three years; and the number of trainees.'' and 
        renumber all additional subparagraphs.
                           Space-Based ADS-B
    Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology 
provides pilots and air traffic controllers with precise, real-time air 
traffic surveillance data that has been proven to increase the safety 
and efficiency of our national airspace. The FAA is currently analyzing 
and evaluating enhancements to ADS-B technology including space-based 
ADS-B (SBA) to enable surveillance in oceanic airspace using satellite-
based receivers. SBA has the potential to reduce separation in oceanic 
airspace, reducing flight times, fuel consumption, and emissions, as 
well as harmonizing standards across international airspace boundaries. 
SBA can also provide more accurate search and rescue operations in 
oceanic environments.
    I urge the Committee to include the following language in FAA 
reauthorization legislation to encourage the FAA to develop and 
implement a plan to use SBA in U.S. oceanic airspace:
Sec. ___. Use of Advanced Surveillance
    (a)  In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall develop and implement a 
plan to--
      (1)  use space-based ADS-B surveillance, within United States 
airspace or international airspace delegated to the United States for--
        (A)  positive air traffic control, including separation of 
aircraft by implementing the ICAO Advanced Surveillance-Enhanced 
Procedural Separation standard;
        (B)  air traffic flow management;
        (C)  search and rescue;
        (D)  accident investigation; and
        (E)  data analytics.
      (2)  coordinate with counterparts at air service navigation 
providers in airspace that is adjacent to United States airspace or 
international airspace delegated to the United States to--
        (A)  adopt reduced separation standards in oceanic airspace;
        (B)  implement procedures that will permit user preferred 
routes to increase fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions; 
and

                       Leesburg Executive Airport
    Finally, I want to share with the Committee some information 
regarding Leesburg Executive Airport (JYO), which is located in 
Virginia's 10th Congressional District, and the FAA's Remote Tower 
Pilot Program.
    As you know, the remote tower at JYO has safely provided air 
traffic control services in support of over 170,000 operations since 
2021. JYO, which was previously untowered, has seen significant growth 
since the airport began participating in the Remote Tower Pilot 
Program, with annual operations increasing by 47% since 2018. 
Unfortunately, earlier this year JYO's remote tower system was 
withdrawn from the FAA's System Design Approval process, and as a 
result the airport was informed by the FAA that remote tower services 
would cease on June 14, 2023.
    I am concerned that the removal of air traffic control services at 
JYO would introduce significant safety risks to the airport given its 
increased traffic volume and its proximity to IAD and the Washington, 
DC Special Flight Rules Area. The airport and the FAA are currently 
working to identify an appropriate path forward to maintain air traffic 
control services while a more permanent solution is determined. I do 
not have a specific request of the Committee for FAA reauthorization 
legislation on this matter at this time, but I greatly appreciate the 
Committee's continued attention to this situation should the need arise 
for legislative or oversight action.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today, I greatly 
appreciate your consideration of these priorities as you develop FAA 
reauthorization legislation this year.

                                 
    Prepared Statement of Hon. Nikema Williams, a Representative in 
                   Congress From the State of Georgia
    Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen:
    I appreciate the opportunity to offer testimony before the 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. As a former member of this 
Committee from last Congress, I can attest to the importance this 
Committee to fixing our nation's failing infrastructure, while making 
investments that will push the transportation sector forward into the 
21st century.
    As the member who represents the Fifth Congressional District of 
Georgia, including the City of Atlanta, I have seen firsthand how the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has delivered for my constituents, and I 
look forward to seeing the Inflation Reduction Act fully implemented so 
our nation can truly build back better.
    Again, thank you for all the work that was done last Congress. As 
you all consider legislative priorities for this Congress, I would like 
to highlight some of the priorities that deeply impact my constituents 
in Georgia's Fifth Congressional District:
            Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization
    My district is home to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International 
Airport, the world's busiest and most efficient airport. While I take 
pride in that recognition, many of my constituents, including myself, 
that live near the airport are subject to substantial noise and air 
pollution.
    Aerospace and aviation are responsible for as much as nine percent 
of carbon emissions from United States transportation. Such emissions 
often negatively impact disadvantaged communities near our nation's 
airports. While initial investments in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) 
have been made this year, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, more 
must be done to help the aviation sector transition to a low emission 
future. It is imperative that we focus on robust investments in the 
production and distribution of cleaner fuels if we hope to decarbonize 
the industry.
    I also ask the Committee to consider funding and to continue to 
invest in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)'s Continuous Lower 
Energy, Emissions and Noise (CLEEN) Program, which is FAA's principal 
environmental effort to accelerate the development of new aircraft and 
engine technologies. These are crucial in developing technologies that 
will reduce noise, emissions, and fuel burn and enable the industry to 
expedite integration of these technologies.
                    Negating Neighborhood Noise Act
    Airplane noise is not the only source of noise pollution in my 
district. Too many of my constituents are frustrated with traffic noise 
near congested interstates. Many of my constituents and their neighbors 
bought their homes years before the construction of nearby interstate 
highways and simply want to live and raise their families in quiet 
neighborhoods. Last Congress, I introduced a bill along with 
Representative Himes of Connecticut and Representative Bacon of 
Nebraska titled the Negating Neighborhood Noise Act, which would allow 
funds from the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program to be used to 
build noise barriers in residential areas built before the interstates 
that are now impacting them. I plan to reintroduce this legislation 
soon. Given that similar language passed in the House as part of the 
Moving Forward Act in the 116th Congress and was also originally in the 
INVEST in America Act last Congress, I hope this Committee gives this 
issue fair consideration.
          Care is an Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) Act
    I also plan to reintroduce the Care is an Economic Development 
Strategy--or CEDS--Act this Congress, which was a bill I was proud to 
have led with the late and great, Don Young.
    Childcare, early childhood education, disability and long-term 
care, and elder care are essential to communities' economic 
development. When children, seniors, and individuals with disabilities 
can get the affordable, quality care they need, their family members 
can return to work, provide for their families, and invigorate our 
economy, while knowing their loved ones are in good hands. Currently, 
Economic Development Districts must consider transportation access, 
workforce development, technology use, and environmental protection 
when creating their comprehensive economic development strategies. 
However, there is no mention of considering quality and affordable 
care-based services. The CEDS Act will task Economic Development 
Districts with showing how they will increase access to services like 
childcare, early childhood education, disability and long-term care, 
and elder care. In the 116th Congress this bill passed out of Committee 
and through the House, and I hope this Committee fully considers this 
legislation when reintroduced or when in discussions of an Economic 
Development Administration reauthorization.
     Water Infrastructure Sustainability and Efficiency (WISE) Act
    Many of my constituents have also raised their concerns with 
wastewater and stormwater pollution. That's why at the beginning of the 
last Congress I introduced the Water Infrastructure Sustainability and 
Efficiency--or WISE--Act.
    Created in 2009 through bipartisan leadership, the Green Project 
Reserve has required Clean Water State Revolving Fund programs to use a 
certain portion of their funds for green infrastructure projects, 
including water or energy efficiency improvements or other 
environmentally innovative activities. However, the exact percentage of 
this set aside has varied year to year, creating uncertainty for water 
or energy efficiency improvements. We have an obligation to our 
constituents to rethink our infrastructure and setting the Green 
Project Reserve set aside at 20 percent of the annual Clean Water State 
Revolving Fund capitalization grant would be a great start. We need to 
ensure states have consistency when they are planning water or energy 
efficiency improvements.
    In closing, thank you Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen for 
the opportunity to testify before you today. I additionally want to 
thank you for the many opportunities you have provided members to 
engage in the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization process. 
I am hopeful this committee continues to build off of the momentum from 
the passage of the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and our 
productive discussions from last Congress. Thank you for your 
consideration.

                                 
   Prepared Statement of Hon. Robert J. Wittman, a Representative in 
               Congress From the Commonwealth of Virginia
                             Introduction:
    Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
    Thank you for allowing me to testify before you today. I am honored 
to highlight some of the needs facing Virginia as you consider 
oversight on the implementation of the Water Resources Development Act 
of 2022.
    The Water Resources Development Act is necessary legislation that 
provides for improvements to the Nation's ports, inland waterways, 
flood protection, ecosystem restoration, and other water resources 
infrastructure and policy. Water infrastructure is vital to moving 
goods throughout the country, from products we all use in our everyday 
lives, to crops and goods we produce domestically and send abroad. I 
hope this committee and the House upholds its duty to authorize 
nationally important water infrastructure improvements that are more 
locally driven.
    Furthermore, I would like to thank the Army Corps of Engineers as 
they work hard to manage more than 1,500 water resource projects with 
many of them in Virginia. The Army Corps of Engineers is critical to 
our commonwealth, from the Norfolk Harbor Channel Widening and 
Deepening Project to the public waterways restoration projects across 
Virginia.
                           Port of Virginia:
    As a proud representative of the Commonwealth of Virginia, home of 
the Port of Virginia--one of the largest and busiest ports on the 
eastern seaboard--advancing the work being done by the Port of Virginia 
to improve and expand its operations is critical. The Port manages 
cargo that is shipped to all 48 contiguous states.
    The Port of Virginia is a national gateway for commerce, supporting 
businesses across the country. Moreover, in Virginia's 1st District, 
234 businesses utilize the services of the Port of Virginia.
    As a catalyst for commerce, the Port is attracting growth, 
fostering development, and creating jobs. On the state level, cargo 
moving through the Port supports more than 436,667 jobs statewide and 
generates in excess of $100.1 billion in annual economic impact for 
Virginia.
                       WRDA Proposals Submitted:
    I would like to take this time to highlight some WRDA priorities 
the subcommittee should look at while conducting oversight of its 
implementation.
1. Norfolk Harbor and Channels: Anchorage F Expansion
    Anchorage F is currently designed as a 3,000-foot diameter circle 
for free-swinging bow anchoring. The anchorage in its current design is 
used primarily as an emergency anchorage in inclement wave weather in 
the harbor or in situations of unexpected delays. For vessels to 
effectively utilize the anchorage, it is imperative--and common-sense--
for the anchorage and approach depths to match that of the Federal 
Channel.
    A deeper and wider anchorage will allow further use of the 
anchorage beyond the primary function and permit use by larger vessels 
calling on our port. Additionally, an improved anchorage and anchorage 
approach could provide passing vessels safe harbor during storm 
conditions.
    The modification includes widening the Anchorage F beyond its 
currently authorized diameter of 3,620-feet to a diameter of 3,840-feet 
and deepening the anchorage to 55-feet consistent with the 1986 
authorization and the project depth of the Federal Channel.
2. Virginia Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study
    I request oversight to ensure the USACE includes Federal properties 
in their feasibility studies for the Norfolk-Hampton Roads, Virginia.
    By allowing the USACE to include Federal properties for an upcoming 
Coastal Storm Risk Management (CSRM) study of the Peninsula and greater 
Hampton Roads area, it would solve the restriction problem in 
incorporating these installations and facilities into the Civil Works 
planning and construction processes. I believe this is a commonsense 
issue that will ultimately produce a better report of action by a range 
of actors in the region.
                              Conclusion:
    I want to thank the Chairman, Ranking Member, and the Members of 
the Committee for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to 
working with the Committee and the Corps to ensure WRDA 2022 is 
implemented as intended.

                                 [all]
