             OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA

    Senator Thune. This hearing will come to order. Good 
morning. Great to have everybody here today, and I will tell 
you in advance that we are going to be juggling about three 
votes on the floor of the Senate but we will try and figure out 
a way to keep everything rolling so we can get everybody's 
comments and questions in, but we are grateful to have all of 
you here this morning. This morning we are going to talk about 
the state of the U.S. spectrum policy. The committee has long 
recognized the need for a thoughtful approach to spectrum 
policy and the important role both the FCC and the NTIA have in 
spectrum management. I appreciate all of you taking the time 
out of your schedules to discuss this topic.
    Spectrum is the lifeblood of wireless communications. Next 
generation wireless networks require efficient and effective 
use of low, mid, and high bands of spectrum. If we do not have 
proper management of this limited resource, we simply won't 
have enough of the right kinds of spectrum available. And in 
the global race to deploy next generation networks and 
services, we have a responsibility to furnish Americans with 
the spectrum fueled 5G ecosystem that will be needed to 
maintain our competitive edge. This is particularly important 
for those of us in more rural parts of the country.
    If inadequacy of spectrum resources makes 5G less viable, 
it will be the rural areas where it no longer makes sense to 
deploy next generation telecommunication services. Here in the 
United States, NTIA is responsible for managing the Federal 
Government spectrum use and the FCC for managing all other 
uses. Both NTIA and the FCC have taken important steps to make 
more spectrum available but more work must be done.
    The FCC, acting in a bipartisan manner, has moved forward 
with bold proposal to make thousands of megahertz of spectrum 
available for license and unlicensed fixed and mobile use, and 
it has proceedings under way to make even more spectrum 
available. Importantly, at the end of this year, the FCC is 
planning an auction to make 280 megahertz of C-band spectrum 
available for commercial license use, and it is critical that 
that auction goes forward without any delays. This mid-band 
spectrum is key to the United States winning the race to 5G.
    As more and more Americans are relying on connectivity like 
Wi-Fi during the coronavirus pandemic, we must also recognize 
the crucial role that unlicensed spectrum plays in the 
communications landscape. Unlicensed spectrum is responsible 
for transmitting a significant amount of the data on our 
networks and will play a tremendous role in development of the 
Internet of things. But as I mentioned before, if we do not 
have proper management of spectrum, we will not have sufficient 
access to the spectrum for commercial purposes. We all know the 
demand for spectrum resources will continue to increase with 
the development of new technologies and the demand will result 
in Government agencies, businesses, and other groups competing 
for these resources which is why I have always supported an all 
of the above approach to make sure we efficiently use the 
limited spectrum resources.
    With respect to commercially licensed spectrum, in my view, 
it is essential the FCC is allowed to rely on the independent, 
technical, and legal expertise of its bureaus and staff, and 
remain the sole expert agency to regulate non-Federal uses of 
spectrum as directed by the statutory authority through the 
Communications Act. The reviews of spectrum usage rights 
undertaken by the FCC are rarely simple.
    I appreciate Chairman Pai's efforts to make more spectrum 
available for licensed and unlicensed use and the entire 
Commission's focus and trust in the technical analysis of its 
engineers to make spectrum decisions in the interest of our 
national and economic security. Commercial spectrum usage 
rights, whether through FCC issued licenses or FCC adopted 
rules, provide the certainty necessary to incentivize and 
enable returns on massive investments in research and 
development, manufacturing, infrastructure deployment, 
innovations, and applications dependent upon commercial 
spectrum.
    And when spectrum is made available, successful spectrum 
policy must establish predictable rights for private entities 
to use the airwaves from satellite to Wi-Fi and terrestrial 
wireless to broadcast. Simply put, efficient and effective 
spectrum management requires clear rules and recognized rights 
for spectrum users. It is also essential for NTIA working with 
Federal agencies through the inter-department Radio Advisory 
Committee to continue to improve the efficiency of Federal 
spectrum. Making the spectrum relocation fund a better resource 
for studying spectrum and relocating Federal incumbents were 
feasible is essential if we are to continue making Federal 
spectrum available for commercial use.
    Sound spectrum management policies and procedures will keep 
spectrum in the pipeline and will help retain American 
leadership in wireless communications. I believe we need to 
make sure the interagency process when making these decisions 
is transparent, and this is only going to be more important as 
we work to free up additional spectrum for commercial use. We 
have got a distinguished panel before us today. I look forward 
to hearing your thoughts on ways to improve the spectrum 
policymaking process to generate the most value for consumers.
    Joining us today, we have Mr. Tom Power from CTIA, the 
Wireless Association; Dr. Roslyn Layton, a visiting researcher, 
Aalborg University; Mr. Mark Gibson who serves as the Director 
of Business Development at CommScope; and Mr. Michael Calabrese 
from New America's Open Technology Institute. He is going to be 
appearing with us virtually today. I want to thank you all for 
being here. I am going to turn to our Ranking Member, Senator 
Schatz, for his opening remarks and he will be delivering those 
remotely, virtually.
    Senator Schatz.

                STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN SCHATZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII

    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Chairman Thune, for holding this 
hearing and I want to thank our witnesses for being here to 
discuss this important topic. As we enter month six of the 
coronavirus pandemic, it has never been more clear how 
important good spectrum policies are for the public and for the 
economy.
    Wireless connectivity has enabled many Americans to remain 
productive and resilient during this time as historic numbers 
of workers, parents, and children continue to try to work and 
learn from home. America's reliance on wireless connectivity 
today is just one example of why it is so important that 
Government decisions on spectrum allocation are technically 
sound and based on good data. Spectrum is a limited but crucial 
resource necessary for cutting-edge technologies like self-
driving vehicles, telemedicine, and public safety networks.
    In order for the U.S. to maintain its global leadership in 
wireless innovation, U.S. spectrum policies need to support 
spectrum sharing technologies that can use multiple adjacent 
bands. Spectrum--excuse me, spectrum is an often discussed 
issue in Congress, but the FCC ultimately has expertise and 
authority to make important technical decisions on commercial 
spectrum sharing and allocation. While Congress has retained 
the right to create laws regarding the deployment of 
communications technologies including spectrum, it has 
entrusted the FCC with rulemaking authority to make data-driven 
technical decisions so that our commercial spectrum is 
allocated for its best and most efficient use, otherwise our 
spectrum policies may fall subject to politics rather than be 
rooted in sound data and engineering analysis.
    As the expert technical agency, it is critical that the FCC 
continues to operate in a non-biased way so that our spectrum 
resources provide the most benefit to our country. However, 
when making these decisions, the FCC must weigh the concerns of 
incumbent users such as utilities, the military, and public 
safety, and safeguard them from potential impacts of new users. 
The FCC must not cripple existing vital uses of spectrum in 
order to free up additional bandwidth.
    The FCC must also consider the concerns of local 
jurisdictions when it adopts rules for the deployment of 
wireless technologies. Just as localities cannot withhold 
access to rights of way in their jurisdictions, the Federal 
Government should not just be allowed to steamroll localities 
just so that companies can have a faster or cheaper rollout. 
There needs to be a fair and reasonable balance that respects 
local control and but also encourages wireless deployment. And 
when discussing spectrum policies, we cannot forget the 
important role unlicensed spectrum and Wi-Fi have in our 
society. Unlicensed spectrum enables a variety of activities in 
our country such as health care monitoring and smart farming, 
it enables essential connectivity for military bases, 
universities, and schools all without the burden of an 
expensive data plan.
    So when we think about equity in broadband adoption, it is 
important to remember that unlicensed wireless technologies 
have to be an integral part of our spectrum policies. Which 
brings me to my final point. Today we will discuss how we can 
ensure that our spectrum policies are forward looking and 
support next generation 5G, connected IoT, and wireless 
technology advancements. However, let's not forget that right 
now, in the middle of the pandemic, tens of millions of our 
fellow Americans don't have any access to broadband.
    Spectrum is an asset that is owned by the American people 
including those who don't have connections today. And so when 
the FCC auctions off this important resource for billions of 
dollars, it is only fair that those revenues are used to help 
to close the digital divide in the United States. By ensuring 
that spectrum auction revenues are used to help Americans, we 
can ensure that the advances in wireless technology go hand-in-
hand with narrowing the digital divide and not toward creating 
a new class of unconnected persons.
    I am sure that today's witnesses and the organizations they 
represent want to make certain that our spectrum policies 
ensure that the next generation of wireless technology can be 
delivered to everyone in America. I appreciate you being here 
today and I look forward to the hearing. Thank you very much.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Schatz, and we will get 
started with our panel. And we will start on my left and your 
right with Mr. Tom Power who as, I said, is the Senior Vice 
President General Counsel for CTIA, the Wireless Association. 
Then proceeded to Mr. Mark Gibson, Director of Business 
Development at CommScope, to Dr. Roslyn Layton, visiting 
researcher at Aalborg University, and then we will hear from 
Mr. Michael Calabrese remotely who is the Director of the 
Wireless Future Project Open Technology Institute at New 
America. So, thank you for being here and we will recognize Mr. 
Power and ask if you could confine your oral remarks to 5 
minutes and we will make sure that your entire testimony is a 
made a part of the written record of the hearing. The first 
vote is underway and we will figure out how to juggle that but 
we will try and keep rolling so we can get through and give 
everybody an opportunity to be heard from and hopefully to 
respond to some questions. So thanks for being here. Mr. Power, 
please proceed.

         STATEMENT OF TOM POWER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT 
                   AND GENERAL COUNSEL, CTIA

    Mr. Power. Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Schatz, and 
members of the Subcommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to 
testify today and let me start by thanking the Committee and 
the FCC for the leadership shown during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
With your encouragement, we have been able to respond 
dynamically to our customers' needs even as the situation 
evolves. So thank you for the opportunity to speak today about 
spectrum policy in the United States and possible improvements 
that could be made. But let's stop to appreciate what we have 
got including the AWS-3 auction that closed in 2015.
    The FCC has auctioned more spectrum in the last 5 years 
than any previous such period netting $67 billion for the U.S. 
Treasury. The FCC conducted the first ever incentive auction 
and the first ever high band auctions. Thanks to Chairman Pai's 
5G fast plan and the oversight of Congress, we are on a pretty 
good streak. We should talk about ways to make it better. But 
let's acknowledge that for all its imperfections, the current 
process has delivered some historic wins for the Nation. We are 
all aware of how this committee's actions have already 
facilitated America's fast start in the global 5G marketplace.
    Last year, U.S. wireless providers were the first to employ 
5G networks and are investing in a projected $275 billion, 
creating 3 million jobs and adding $500 billion to GDP. These 
investments and deployments will improve the lives of Americans 
from South Dakota to Hawaii and throughout the country, through 
access to connected hospitals, safer and more efficient smart 
cities, and the life-changing applications that will grow out 
of our burgeoning 5G ecosystem. The U.S. led the world in 4G, 
both as the first mover in network deployments and in market 
transforming innovation by rapidly deploying low band spectrum.
    As the industry transitions to 5G, we need to add mid-band 
spectrum to the equation as it is particularly well suited to 
combine improved speed and latency with broad coverage. But 
other countries have gotten ahead of us when it comes to mid 
band. By year's end, our international rivals like China will 
have on average five times more licensed mid band spectrum than 
the U.S. The good news is that the FCC will hold two mid-band 
spectrum auctions this year.
    The CBRS auction is commencing today as it happens and the 
C-band auction will take off in December as the Chairman 
recognized. But even taking those into account, by the end of 
2022, a number of other countries are expected to have licensed 
nearly twice as much mid-band spectrums of 5G as the U.S. Now, 
this committee deserves great credit for identifying the lower 
3 gigahertz band currently used by the Defense Department to 
operate radar systems as suitable for commercial use.
    We applaud Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member Schatz for 
introducing the Spectrum Now Act which would require the 
auction of 100 megahertz of that band, an auction that can't 
happen soon enough. There are additional bands that can play a 
critical role in boosting 5G innovation, but the lower 3 
gigahertz band is the next major opportunity to expand critical 
mid-band 5G capacity. Now putting a band like the lower 3 band 
to work requires work among the folks at the Defense 
Department, NTIA, and the FCC. So let me spend a minute 
identifying some proposals to make that work flow more 
efficiently. I mentioned earlier Chairman Wicker and Ranking 
Member Schatz's efforts to the Spectrum Now Act which would 
expand Federal agencies' use of the spectrum relocation fund to 
examine ways to shrink their spectrum footprint.
    We also applaud Senator Lee for introducing the Government 
Spectrum Valuation Act which would give this committee and the 
Administration better insight into the market value of spectrum 
and to ensure its being put to its best and highest use. We 
similarly wish to recognize Senator Markey's work to 
incentivize agencies to move all spectrum that could otherwise 
be reallocated to consumer uses.
    We also strongly commend Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member 
Cantwell along with the Senate Armed Services Chairman Inhofe 
and Ranking Member Reed for their collaboration on the Spectrum 
IT Modernization Act of 2020. We support this legislation and 
its effort to make the management of Federal spectrum more 
efficient.
    For many years, this committee has paved the way for U.S. 
leadership in wireless from the MOBILE NOW Act under the 
leadership of Chairman Thune and former Ranking Member Nelson, 
to the AIRWAVES Act thanks to Senator Gardner and Senator 
Hassan. Now, we look forward to working with you on a new 
spectrum auction pipeline for the years to come. I look forward 
to discussing these issues with you this morning and thank you 
again for the opportunity to testify.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Power follows:]

        Prepared Statement of Tom Power, Senior Vice President 
                       and General Counsel, CTIA
    Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Schatz, and members of the 
Subcommittee, on behalf of CTIA and the U.S. wireless industry, I 
appreciate the opportunity to testify today. Let me start by expressing 
our strong appreciation for the leadership exhibited by this Committee 
and the FCC in responding to the COVID-19 crisis, which has highlighted 
the critical role that wireless plays in keeping us connected to our 
family and friends, our jobs, our schools, and our communities. Your 
leadership has allowed the wireless industry to dynamically respond to 
the needs of its customers, even as this situation evolves.
    Your leadership will be just as critical to ensuring a strong 
foundation for our Nation's 5G economy over the next decade. The 
combined efforts of this Committee, Congress, the FCC, and the 
Administration have facilitated a historic four years of spectrum 
successes. In that time, we completed the first ever incentive auction 
and, under Chairman Pai's 5G FAST Plan, we completed the first ever 
high-band spectrum auctions. We now have the opportunity to build on 
this foundation to make more spectrum available for 5G--particularly in 
the critical mid-band.
    I have served at the FCC, NTIA, the White House Office of Science 
and Technology Policy, and in the private sector, and I know very well 
the essential role that spectrum management policies play. Indeed, the 
availability of, and access to, sufficient and appropriate spectrum is 
the key to reaping the full benefits of 5G--not only in terms of 
economic growth, job creation, and public safety--but also by ensuring 
we are able to meet unexpected and unprecedented demands when the need 
arises. So today, I'd like to describe the wireless landscape in the 
U.S., note the priorities we need to balance as we deploy 5G and in 
mid-band spectrum, and point out some opportunities to improve the 
processes government uses to identify and repurpose underutilized

        Services, the Importance of Investment, and the Work that 
        Remains
    This Committee's actions have already facilitated America's fast 
start in the global 5G marketplace. U.S. wireless providers gained a 
first mover advantage last year when they were the first to deploy 
commercial 5G networks.\1\ The U.S. wireless industry is projected to 
invest $275 billion on 5G deployments, create three million jobs, and 
add $500 billion to GDP. These investments will be made possible by 
your leadership; the certainty you fostered has driven faster 
deployment, with residents from South Dakota to Hawaii and beyond 
already enjoying the benefits of 5G. And with scale, 5G will be even 
more transformative--improving the lives of all Americans through 
access to connected hospitals, safer and more efficient smart cities, 
and the life-changing applications that will grow out of our burgeoning 
5G ecosystem.

    Unprecedented Growth in Wireless. The U.S. continues to experience 
unprecedented growth in demand for wireless services, especially since 
the onset of the pandemic. In 2018 alone, we saw an 82 percent increase 
in mobile traffic. The increase from 2018 to 2019 was greater than the 
total amount of mobile traffic on U.S. networks just four years ago.\2\ 
And when, in a matter of days, much of the U.S. transitioned to staying 
at home, we witnessed a dramatic increase in demand for wireless 
services. Almost overnight, voice traffic jumped 20-40 percent; major 
providers saw a 25 percent increase in texting; data traffic grew 
nearly 20 percent, with one nationwide provider reporting an increase 
in mobile device hotspot usage of nearly 40 percent; and applications 
that provide telehealth and web/video conferencing services saw huge 
usage increases--well over 1,000 percent.\3\ U.S. wireless carriers 
handled that increased demand with barely a hitch. In fact, despite 
these trends, U.S. average mobile download speeds actually went up 
slightly.\4\

    The Importance of Investment. U.S. wireless providers rose to this 
occasion thanks to continued and massive year-over-year investments. In 
2018, the wireless industry made capex investments of $24.7 billion 
primarily for expanding network capacity and coverage and making 
upgrades to support 5G.\5\ According to a recent NERA study, these 
investments allowed the industry to meet customer demand while 
simultaneously delivering better value than carriers in any of 36 other 
countries studied; U.S. consumers save nearly $10 billion per year by 
virtue of the superior value that U.S. wireless providers offer.\6\

    The Work that Remains: The Need for Mid-band Spectrum. As 
successful as we have been, the next few years will define our 5G 
future. The U.S. led the world in 4G--both as the first mover in 
network deployment and in market-transforming innovation. We rapidly 
made available a world-leading 752 megahertz of low-band spectrum,\7\ 
the propagation characteristics of which allowed carriers to quickly 
deploy 4G networks over large geographic areas. Today carriers have 
been repurposing some of that low-band spectrum to 5G. Carriers have 
also gained access to significant amounts of high-band spectrum, which 
is ideal for delivering very high speeds and low latency over discrete 
geographic areas. But while this progress on low- and high-band 
spectrum is important, the key to ensuring U.S. leadership will be the 
availability of mid-band spectrum, which sits at the 5G ``sweet spot'' 
offering capacity and coverage. Mid-band spectrum is perfectly suited 
to deliver higher speeds and improved latency, particularly in more 
rural areas.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There is a growing global consensus that mid-band spectrum should 
be allocated for 5G. Unfortunately, other nations are beating us to the 
punch. One study found that 13 other leading countries will have, on 
average, five times more licensed mid-band spectrum than the U.S. by 
the end of this year.\8\ And even after the U.S. executes on its 
current mid-band plans through 2022, five countries are expected to 
have allocated nearly twice that amount of mid-band spectrum by 
then.\9\ As other countries work to seize the mantle of 5G leadership, 
we need to rapidly employ an ``all-of-the-above'' spectrum strategy to 
make as much mid-band spectrum available as possible, with a particular 
emphasis on repurposing government spectrum.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Balancing Spectrum Allocation Priorities
    Spectrum allocation decisions have always required that 
policymakers balance competing priorities. First, we need to properly 
allocate spectrum between the Federal government and the commercial 
sector to reflect current national priorities. Most spectrum is 
currently in the hands of the Federal government, a function of the 
varied role that spectrum has long played in supporting government 
missions--including national defense. But that spectrum is an 
increasingly critical input to another national priority--a robust and 
innovative economy that creates jobs and economic growth for all 
Americans and empowers their full participation in all aspects of 
American society.
    Second, within the commercial sector, spectrum must be reasonably 
allocated between licensed and unlicensed use. While unlicensed is 
indispensable, the U.S. has become a global outlier by allocating such 
a large share of commercial spectrum for unlicensed use--particularly 
in mid-band. The right strategy must properly balance government and 
commercial needs and licensed and unlicensed use.
    Shifting the Balance to Commercial Use. The Federal government has 
long been the largest spectrum user in the U.S., and out of the 5,400 
megahertz of mid-band spectrum between 3.0 GHz and 8.4 GHz, DoD alone 
occupies a total of 3,600 megahertz--66.67 percent. Decisions that 
resulted in this allocation were based on national priorities and the 
state of radio technologies from 50 years ago. Our spectrum management 
decisions must reflect the new reality of ever-growing demand for 
commercial wireless services and significant technological advancements 
across all radio services.
    As I know all too well from my time at NTIA, Federal systems 
sometimes rely on decades-old technologies that are not spectrally 
efficient. Without reform and proper funding, these systems could 
occupy essential spectrum resources inefficiently for years to come. 
But if we get our policy decisions right, a shift toward commercial use 
will allow these Federal users to deploy new and more spectrally 
efficient technologies that can help them better achieve their 
missions--a spectrum management ``win-win.'' There is certainly 
precedent: the AWS-3 auction gave the U.S. the lead in making spectrum 
available for 4G while simultaneously allowing DoD to upgrade legacy 
radios, the Department of Energy to transition microwave systems to 
more reliable fiber, and the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development to upgrade to Internet Protocol-based systems.\10\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Three bands represent our next ``win-win'' opportunities:

    The Lower 3 GHz Band. This Committee deserves great credit for 
identifying the Lower 3 GHz band (3.1-3.55 GHz), currently used by DoD 
to operate high-powered radar systems and by some non-federal secondary 
users, as suitable for transition to commercial use. We also applaud 
Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member Schatz for introducing the 
Supplementing the Pipeline for Efficient Control of The Resources for 
Users Making New Opportunities for Wireless (SPECTRUM NOW) Act, which 
will lead to the auction of the 3.45-3.55 GHz band for commercial use. 
CTIA supports the FCC's plan to prepare the Lower 3 GHz band for 
expanded commercial wireless use by removing existing non-federal 
secondary allocations in 3.3-3.55 GHz and relocating incumbent non-
federal operations. NTIA's recent report sought to evaluate whether 
commercial and government operators can share this band, but we urge 
NTIA to examine the potential to clear--rather than share--as much of 
this band as possible. The Lower 3 GHz band is the next major 
opportunity to expand critical mid-band 5G capacity.
    Internationally, our 5G competitors have already made an average of 
nearly 200 megahertz available for commercial use between 3.3 and 3.6 
GHz--compared to 0 megahertz in the U.S. (albeit with the 3.5 GHz 
auction underway that includes 3.55-3.6 GHz).\11\ The 3.1-3.55 GHz band 
is a crucial near-term opportunity for the U.S. to make licensed mid-
band spectrum available, and if the U.S. moves quickly, it has the 
opportunity to be a key benchmark band for U.S. leadership. Unlocking 
this band will also allow U.S. device and network equipment 
manufacturers to build to globally harmonized international 
specifications, creating economies of scale and driving down the cost 
of wireless equipment and services for U.S. companies and consumers. 
But there is much work to do, and time is not a luxury we have.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ Spectrum Comparison Report at 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1.3 GHz and 1.7 GHz bands. Two low-band opportunities will be key 
to meeting Congress's requirement in the Spectrum Pipeline Act of 2015 
that NTIA identify and reallocate at least 30 megahertz of spectrum 
below 3 GHz for commercial use.\12\ The potential for repurposing 
spectrum in the 1.3 GHz band is being studied by a pioneering cross-
agency program, and could provide up to 50 megahertz--while helping the 
Federal Aviation Administration and other incumbent users modernize 
legacy radar and related systems. Similarly, the 1.7 GHz band could 
offer 50 megahertz directly adjacent to AWS-3 spectrum, presenting 
great synergies with existing wireless offerings. We all need to stay 
committed to these efforts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Balancing Licensed and Unlicensed Use. Sound policy also requires 
us to balance the amount of commercial spectrum available between 
licensed and unlicensed use, in the mid-band in particular. With the 
FCC's recent decision \13\ to commit all 1200 megahertz of the 6 GHz 
band to unlicensed use, there are now 1,860 megahertz of mid-band 
spectrum available for unlicensed operations. By contrast, today's 3.5 
GHz auction represents the very first opportunity for carriers to 
access licensed mid-band spectrum--and it is only 70 megahertz. While 
thanks to the leadership of the FCC, the C-band auction in December 
will make another 280 megahertz available that will bring the total 
amount of licensed mid-band spectrum to only 350 megahertz.\14\

    \14\ Mid-Band Global Update at 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In contrast, five leading nations in the 5G race are each expected 
to bring 660 megahertz of licensed mid-band spectrum to market by 2022. 
That's nearly double the licensed U.S. spectrum. A total of 350 
megahertz is simply not enough licensed spectrum to stay competitive, 
especially in 5G. Access to more licensed mid-band spectrum is the key 
to U.S. 5G leadership.
Opportunities to Improve U.S. Spectrum Management Policies
    There are also real opportunities for the U.S. to improve its 
spectrum management practices as we lean into 5G.
    Repurposing Federal Spectrum. The U.S. has an ever-improving track 
record when it comes to creating ``win-win'' outcomes through 
repurposing Federal spectrum--in large part because of the leadership 
of this Committee. In 2004, Congress passed the Commercial Spectrum 
Enhancement Act (``CSEA''). The CSEA created the innovative Spectrum 
Relocation Fund (``SRF''), which incented agencies to relocate by 
providing certainty that they would receive sufficient funding to 
maintain their Federal missions. The SRF funds Federal agency efforts 
to identify spectrum available for commercial use, guarantees that they 
will be reimbursed for their relocation costs and, critically, then 
replenishes the monies with the auction revenue made possible by the 
relocation. The SRF has already transferred nearly $4.6 billion to 
Federal agencies to upgrade their systems--and there has been 
remarkable progress.
    The 2006 AWS-1 auction was the first time the U.S. government 
applied the CSEA. That auction, and a follow-on auction in 2008, 
generated a total of $13.7 billion in winning bids, at a Federal 
relocation cost of $1.55 billion.\15\ I am no economist, but 775 
percent is a pretty solid ROI, and doesn't even include the value of 
the resulting new jobs and increased GDP. And it's worth noting that 
the complexity of the process did not prevent its success; this 
transition required the relocation of 1,990 NTIA-issued Federal 
frequency assignments from 12 Federal agencies. These incumbents ranged 
from fixed microwave systems used to transmit voice and data signals to 
more specialized law enforcement video and surveillance systems and 
mobile aeronautical systems.\16\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The CSEA also played a key role in the highest grossing spectrum 
auction in U.S. history, the AWS-3 auction in 2015. There, the FCC 
auctioned two Federal spectrum bands that contained more than 200 
systems or programs that qualified for CSEA transition funding, ranging 
from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration microwave 
operations to DoD air combat training.\17\ All told, the AWS-3 auction 
brought in $41.3 billion, with total Federal relocation costs of $5.1 
billion \18\--another ROI of more than 700 percent.

sharing costs for the 1695-1710 MHz band were $527.1 million and the 
total estimated relocation and sharing costs for the 1755-1780 MHz band 
were $4.576 billion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Increasing the Flexibility of the SRF. Policymakers should consider 
upgrading the SRF to fund Federal incumbent efforts to enhance their 
spectrum efficiency. Since 2010, U.S. wireless providers have increased 
their spectral efficiency 42 times--a rate that Federal users cannot 
match under the current regime.\19\ While Congress made targeted SRF 
modifications in 2012, 2015, and 2017 to increase the program's 
flexibility by allowing it to support critical research and 
development, more needs to be done to incentivize Federal agencies to 
more efficiently use scarce spectrum assets. We therefore again wish to 
praise Chairman Wicker's and Ranking Member Schatz's efforts through 
the SPECTRUM NOW Act, as well as the leadership exhibited by Senators 
Moran and Udall on this important issue.

Industry Maximizes Its Spectrum, (July 2019), https://www.ctia.org/

since-2010-new-paper-shows.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Improved Transparency and Incentives. Unlike commercial uses, the 
lost opportunity costs of underutilized Federal spectrum are rarely 
transparent. We therefore applaud Senator Lee for introducing the 
Government Spectrum Valuation Act, which would better equip this 
Committee and the Administration to determine the market value of 
spectrum and to ensure it is being put to its best and highest use. We 
similarly wish to recognize Senator Markey's work to incentivize 
agencies to move off spectrum that could otherwise be reallocated to 
consumer uses. We hope these important legislative efforts move forward 
this Congress.
    Enhancing the Federal Spectrum Framework. We also strongly commend 
Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member Cantwell, along with Senate Armed 
Services Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Reed, for their 
collaboration on the Spectrum IT Modernization Act of 2020. We support 
this legislation and its effort to make the management of Federal 
spectrum more efficient. It often takes well over a decade for Federal 
bands to be identified, reallocated, and deployed by commercial 
wireless providers. This legislation will allow NTIA, through 
modernization and forward-thinking planning, to be better-positioned to 
unlock win-win opportunities more expeditiously. This is certainly a 
tool I wish we had when I served at NTIA, and I hope this legislation 
will pass swiftly.
    Increasing Industry/Government Collaboration. The feasibility of 
reallocating Federal spectrum must be based on the actual operating 
characteristics of Federal systems--which of course requires the 
exchange of information that is often deemed classified. Collaboration 
and trust between government and industry can be challenging to achieve 
but yields results that benefit Federal users, the wireless industry, 
and consumers alike. For example, the successful AWS-3 information 
sharing process was driven through a Federal advisory committee 
structure. That process, in turn, was built on the foundation laid by 
AWS-1.\20\ Enhanced ``Trusted Agent'' models could facilitate the 
exchange of information between Federal agencies and industry to drive 
identification and analysis of Federal spectrum uses, protect sensitive 
government and commercial information, and serve as an impartial 
clearinghouse for stakeholders to address issues, but create the 
potential for delay. Policymakers must continue to explore ways to 
streamline and expedite this process to drive more efficient spectrum 
management.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Maximizing Intergovernmental Cooperation. We are pleased that 
Congress continues to recognize the respective allocation of 
responsibilities between the FCC, NTIA, and Federal spectrum users. 
Commercial spectrum has never been--and should not be--governed by DoD 
if we want the technological advances and productivity gains that are 
stimulated by private sector investment. Any consideration of spectrum 
sharing policy decisions, technologies, or reports involving Federal 
and non-federal spectrum should be led by the FCC and/or NTIA. But as a 
veteran of both agencies, I know first-hand the challenges posed by the 
interagency process and shared spectrum jurisdiction. There are very 
few formal structures to guide the agencies; a fairly general 2003 
Memorandum of Understanding between the FCC and NTIA is the primary 
guidance document. But as this hearing makes clear, spectrum policy has 
only become more important over the past two decades, and the existing 
processes are no longer working as effectively. Stakeholders on all 
sides agree that the process that preceded the auction of the 24 GHz 
band--which didn't happen until five years after the FCC identified the 
band as a candidate for 5G use, and over a year after the FCC put rules 
in place--was not constructive. I applaud this Committee's commitment 
to identifying the appropriate structures and processes for the race to 
5G and beyond. Our common national interest in sound spectrum 
management underscores the importance of coordinated spectrum policy 
decision-making.
    Creating a Spectrum Pipeline. This Committee has always been a 
leader in spectrum policy and we encourage you once again to take up 
that mantle with a spectrum pipeline bill that charts the course for 
our country's 5G goals. Chairman Thune and then-Ranking Member Nelson 
brought us the MOBILE NOW Act, and Sens. Gardner and Hassan followed up 
with the introduction of the AIRWAVES Act. We are hopeful we can work 
again with this Committee on the next generation of spectrum pipeline 
legislation.

    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. CTIA appreciates 
this Committee's leadership in promoting 5G through sound spectrum 
management processes and results. We look forward to continuing to work 
with all of you to advance our ability to identify and reallocate 
critical mid-band spectrum that will allow us to maintain our global 
leadership.

             STATEMENT OF H. MARK GIBSON, DIRECTOR,

               BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND SPECTRUM

                SHARING POLICY, COMMSCOPE, INC.

    Mr. Gibson. Thank you, Chairman Thune and Ranking Member 
Schatz, and members of the Subcommittee, and thank you also for 
the opportunity to testify on the state of U.S. spectrum policy 
today. It is truly an honor and pleasure to be here. CommScope 
is a leading U.S. developer and a manufacturer of wireless 
network equipment. Our products and services provide the 
critical building blocks that U.S. carriers and enterprises 
need to deploy and operate their next generation wireless 
networks.
    Our customers range from small rural wireless carriers to 
large global wireless Internet service providers, from local 
telecom providers to Nationwide cable companies and many other 
Americans in virtually every sector of the economy. Our 
customers operate in every state of the United States and 
lately we have also been working with nonprofit organizations 
plus our partners and employees to provide much-needed 
assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, by 
equipping school buses with Wi-Fi and LTE backhaul and parking 
them in neighborhoods were families lack Internet access.
    I would also like to note as Mr. Power suggested and 
identified that today is the beginning of the CBRS auction, the 
Citizens Broadband Radio Service auction of priority access 
licenses. This culminates more than 8 years of challenging yet 
highly productive work among many stakeholders, including our 
Federal partners at the FCC and NTIA. CBRS is an example of 
what has worked well in U.S. spectrum policy, while also 
highlighting some areas where we can improve upon spectrum 
management processes and interactions among stakeholders both 
within Government and industry. One mission of CommScope is to 
help make spectrum available as fast as possible for the 
broadest uses as possible. We strongly believe that U.S. 
leadership and wireless technology relies on quick access to 
spectrum. The U.S. has long been the world leader in wireless 
technologies and innovative ways to maximize the use of a 
spectrum allocation.
    Some of the recent innovations around dynamic spectrum 
sharing have been critical in introducing new wireless 
services. However, 8 years to commercialize a band like CBRS is 
simply too long. While we are improving on that timeline, there 
is still much work to be done. To be sure, each spectrum 
allocation proceeds at its own pace. For example, while access 
to the 6 gigahertz spectrum appears to be progressing rather 
quickly, the lower mid-band 3100 to 3550 megahertz spectrum 
will likely take longer to be available for commercial use. We 
need to shorten the spectrum availability pipeline.
    One significant factor that contributes to the extended 
length of many of these spectrum proceedings is the reality 
that because we are a leader in wireless technologies, we have 
allocated almost all of the low and mid-band frequencies. 
Efforts to repurpose or share those bands for next generation 
services inherently involve incumbent users and discussions on 
the impacts to existing services. And many of these incumbents 
are also Federal spectrum users.
    CommScope supports a comprehensive long-term National 
spectrum policy that addresses the Nation's anticipated needs 
for new allocations of licensed and unlicensed frequencies. Our 
spectrum policy should also incorporate newer, dynamically 
coordinated sharing regimes where feasible, building upon the 
innovative approaches in CBRS and 6 gigahertz. These newer 
coordinated sharing regimes should accommodate a range of 
access types including quasi-licensed and quasi-unlicensed. And 
they are able to rebalance how bands are allocated over time in 
response to demand. This provides a complement to their 
traditional allocation types and offers regulators and 
policymakers a new tool in their spectrum management toolkit.
    Reallocation spectrum for clearing shared-use brings up the 
issue of how to work with incumbents. Our experience indicates 
that a good way to address incumbent issues is to establish a 
framework for collaboration among stakeholders early in the 
process. Examples of successful collaboration include AWS-3, 
CBRS, and the ongoing collaborations in the 3.7 and 6 gigahertz 
bands.
    We must leverage and strengthen these collaborations among 
all spectrum stakeholders in order to maintain and extend 
America's leadership in wireless technologies and services. 
NTIA and DOD have highlighted the critical role of industry in 
areas of national interests such as 5G services for Federal 
users and modernization of the spectrum management systems. 
CommScope continues to engage in these activities along with 
other critical public, private collaborations such as Federal 
support of next-generation Open RAN architectures, which will 
help accelerate America's 5G build out.
    So again, Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Schatz, and 
members of the Subcommittee, thank you again for holding this 
hearing and I look forward to answering your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Gibson follows:]

 Prepared Statement of H. Mark Gibson, Director, Business Development 
              and Spectrum Sharing Policy, CommScope, Inc.
    Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Schatz, Chairman Wicker, Ranking 
Member Cantwell and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today on the state of U.S. Spectrum Policy; it 
is truly an honor and pleasure to be here today.
    The timing of this hearing is particularly significant as today is 
also the beginning of the long-awaited Citizens Broadband Radio Service 
(CBRS) auction of Priority Access Licenses (PALs). This culminates more 
than eight years of challenging, yet highly-productive work among many 
stakeholders including our Federal partners, the FCC and NTIA. I think 
CBRS is an example of what has worked well in U.S. spectrum policy, 
while also highlighting some areas where we can improve upon the 
spectrum management processes and interactions among stakeholders 
within both government and industry.
    Spectrum is the lifeblood that our Nation needs in order to realize 
the economic and social benefits of new technologies and myriad 
resulting wireless services such as the mobile cellular networks, Land 
Mobile Radio, broadcast, satellite, microwave, CBRS, Wi-Fi and millions 
of innovative unlicensed devices, and many more.
    The U.S. has long been the world leader in wireless technologies 
and innovative ways to wring every hertz out of a spectrum allocation. 
Some of the recent innovations around dynamic spectrum sharing have 
been critical to introducing new wireless services. We will be building 
on dynamic sharing as we investigate new spectrum opportunities.
    We must also look for ways to use spectrum more efficiently and to 
make spectrum available more quickly. Eight years to commercialize a 
band like CBRS is too long. While we are improving on that timeline, 
there is still work to be done. To be sure, each spectrum allocation 
proceeding moves at its own pace. For example, while access to the 6 
GHz spectrum appears to be progressing rather quickly at this time, the 
lower mid-band (3100-3550 MHz) will likely take longer to be available 
for commercial use. We must shorten the spectrum availability 
pipeline--the period from when spectrum is identified to when it is put 
into service.
    One significant contributing factor to the extended length of many 
of these spectrum proceedings is the simple reality that because we are 
a leader in wireless technologies (for both commercial and government 
uses), we have allocated virtually all of the low and mid-band 
frequencies. Efforts to repurpose or share those bands for next-
generation services inherently involve incumbent users and discussions 
on the impacts to existing services. Many of these incumbents are 
Federal spectrum users.
    CommScope supports a comprehensive, long-term national spectrum 
policy that addresses the Nation's anticipated needs for new 
allocations of licensed and unlicensed frequencies, the time-tested 
allocation types upon which we have established our existing wireless 
leadership. In addition, our spectrum policy should incorporate newer, 
dynamically-coordinated sharing regimes, building upon the innovative 
approaches in CBRS and 6 GHz. These newer coordinated sharing regimes 
should accommodate a range of access types, including ``quasi-
licensed'' and ``quasi-unlicensed,'' and are able to rebalance how 
bands are allocated over time in response to demand, thus providing a 
complement to the traditional allocations and offering regulators and 
policymakers a new tool in their spectrum management toolkit.
    Reallocating spectrum for clearing or shared use brings up the 
issue of how to address incumbents. Our experience is that one of the 
best ways to address incumbent issues is to establish a framework for 
collaboration among stakeholders early in the process. Examples of such 
successful collaboration include AWS-3, CBRS, and the recent and 
ongoing collaborations in the 3.7 GHz and 6 GHz bands.
    As a nation we must leverage and strengthen these collaborations 
among all spectrum stakeholders in order to maintain and extend 
America's leadership in wireless technologies and services. NTIA and 
DoD have highlighted the critical role of industry in areas of national 
interest such as 5G services for Federal users and spectrum management 
systems modernization. CommScope continues to engage in these 
activities, along with other critical public/private collaborations 
such as Federal support for next generation Open RAN architectures 
which will help accelerate America's 5G buildout.
    Finally, some of the work of the Commerce Spectrum Management 
Advisory Committee (CSMAC) at NTIA is worth considering. One of their 
working groups will be suggesting an implementation structure and 
governance model in consideration of the pending National Spectrum 
Strategy.
Overview of CommScope
    CommScope is a leading U.S. developer and manufacturer of wireless 
network equipment. Our portfolio of products includes the critical 
building blocks that U.S. carriers and enterprises need to deploy and 
operationalize their next generation wireless networks--for each and 
every part of those networks, including fiber infrastructure and 
backhaul, macro cellular sites, outdoor small cells, in-building and 
venue wireless (Wi-Fi and cellular), and spectrum management solutions. 
More broadly, our company is also a key provider of broadband 
solutions, ranging from innovative technologies which increase the 
speed and expand the deployment of broadband networks to the customer 
equipment needed to access these broadband services. Our customers 
range from small rural wireless Internet service providers to large 
global wireless operators; from local telecom providers to nationwide 
cable operators and American companies in virtually every sector of the 
economy. CommScope's customers operate in every state of the U.S.
    CommScope has been, and continues to be, an active and leading 
participant in numerous spectrum-related proceedings. We are active in 
nearly 100 Standards Development Organizations, including 3GPP and 
IEEE. CommScope was a founding member of the CBRS Alliance and fills 
its Presidency. We also serve on the Board of the Wireless Innovation 
Forum. CommScope was one of the first authorized CBRS Spectrum Access 
System (SAS) operators and has been a TV White Space database 
administrator. CommScope also has over 40 years of spectrum management 
experience and expertise.
    One mission of CommScope is to help make spectrum available for the 
broadest uses and applications as fast as possible. Our leadership in 
wireless and spectrum issues has been key in bringing new spectrum 
bands online for 5G, including:

   Licensed, unlicensed, and shared spectrum solutions and 
        services across the low/mid/high bands,

   Dynamic spectrum sharing (TVWS, CBRS, 6 GHz AFC); both on 
        the RAN and spectrum management systems and supporting 
        services. For instance, CommScope is an FCC-designated SAS/ESC 
        administrator,

   FCC-designated frequency administration for services such as 
        the 70/80/90 GHz service and Wireless Medical Telemetry 
        Service,\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ CommScope is the technical partner to the American Society for 
Healthcare Engineering of the American Hospital Association who are the 
FCC-designated frequency coordinator for the WMTS.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Open RAN development, standardization, and advocacy,

   Close collaboration with various Federal agencies, including 
        the FCC, NTIA, DoD, FAA, DoE, etc. on spectrum initiatives such 
        as AWS-3, CBRS, 3.1-3.55 GHz, 7-8 GHz, 70/80/90 GHz, etc. 
        CommScope is also a charter member of the National Spectrum 
        Consortium.

    In particular, CommScope is a demonstrated leader in Open RAN 
initiatives. CommScope has contributed to standardization efforts by 
the O-RAN Alliance, a consortium of mobile network operators and vendor 
companies, since it was founded in February 2019 and has actively 
participated in Open RAN demonstrations with other O-RAN Alliance 
members. In addition, CommScope is a founding member of the Open RAN 
Policy Coalition, which promotes policies that will advance Open RAN 
solutions.
U.S. Leadership in Wireless Technology Relies on Quick Access to 
        Spectrum
    In a 2015 report,\2\ CTIA indicated that it takes about 13 years to 
make spectrum available to consumers. We are improving on that timeline 
thanks in part to your leadership on advancing legislation such as the 
MOBILE NOW Act. However, we still have much to do. It has taken eight 
years to commercialize CBRS. And while 6 GHz spectrum may come online 
in record time, the lower mid-band (3100-3550 MHz) will likely take 
many years to be realized for commercial use. The C-Band will have 
taken over six years from the time of the FCC's initial Mid-Band NOI to 
the time when nationwide wireless services can be deployed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    CommScope commends Chairman Pai and the FCC for their actions under 
the 5G FAST Plan to identify and accelerate new allocations of 
licensed, unlicensed, and shared spectrum in the low, mid, and high 
bands. Collectively, we must seek ways to decrease the time from 
pipeline identification to commercial use.
    We are encouraged by the Committee's leadership in the bipartisan 
approval of S. 3717, the Spectrum IT Modernization Act, in the Fiscal 
Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). As the Nation's 
demands for spectrum continue to increase rapidly and we seek 
efficiencies in Federal and commercial spectrum utilization, it is 
critical that the spectrum management technologies, tools, and 
infrastructures of NTIA be improved and modernized. Industry relies 
heavily on NTIA to perform complex engineering analyses of spectrum 
usage, spectrum-sharing feasibility and signal coverage. NTIA was 
invaluable in providing engineering support for AWS-3 and CBRS. We 
expect that modernizing and improving the capabilities of NTIA and 
other Federal agencies will improve spectrum utilization efficiencies 
for all U.S. spectrum users.
    The U.S. needs to expedite ongoing research, development, testing, 
and evaluation to develop advanced technologies, innovative spectrum-
utilization methods, and spectrum-sharing tools and techniques that 
increase spectrum access, efficiency, and effectiveness.
    A comprehensive, long-term national spectrum policy should 
incorporate traditionally licensed and unlicensed approaches.
    We have interests, business, and customers in practically every 
corner of the spectrum-scape. From traditional and non-traditional 
wireless operators who use spectrum across the low, mid, and high band 
ranges to provide 5G services; to enterprises and customers who rely on 
Wi-Fi devices; to rural wireless Internet service providers who are 
providing critical communications to rural Americans during COVID; to 
utilities managing the Nation's energy supply, we are acutely aware of 
the need to have flexible approaches to spectrum allocation and 
assignment.
    The MOBILE NOW Act is a great example of this flexibility. Calling 
for 500 MHz of spectrum to be allocated to several uses including 
spectrum below 6 GHz for mobile and fixed wireless broadband use and 
spectrum for commercial mobile and unlicensed use, there is something 
for everyone.
    Similarly, the FCC's ``Mid-band Notice of Inquiry'' resulted in 
rulemakings that will repurpose 1480 MHz for licensed and unlicensed 
use in the 4 GHz and 6 GHz bands. This will have profound effects on 
new technologies and capabilities to support America's increasing need 
for broadband.
    We need to work together to create flexible models for spectrum 
management, including standards, incentives, and enforcement mechanisms 
that promote efficient and effective spectrum use, including flexible-
use spectrum allocations or licenses, while accounting for critical 
safety and security concerns.
    Spectrum policy should consider and promote spectrum-sharing 
approaches where appropriate.
    Virtually all the spectrum in the low, mid, and high bands has some 
degree of incumbent use. For example, according to the NTIA, the 3100-
3550 MHz bands contain over 330 frequency assignments.\3\ In the CBRS 
band, there are over 7800 grandfathered sites licensed for use by 
wireless Internet service providers and utilities, there are over 90 
fixed satellite earth station sites plus an unknown number of DoD radar 
locations.\4\ According to the FCC, the 6 GHz bands (5925-7125 MHz) 
contain almost 47,700 assignments.\5\ In the C-Band, there are 66 
satellites and over 18,000 earth stations.\6\

    Relocation is often not feasible or takes a long time and ends up 
delaying the introduction of new wireless services. The recent NTIA 
analyses on the feasibility of commercial wireless sharing with Federal 
systems in 3100-3550 MHz bands were generally predicated on the 
assumption that there would be no changes to incumbent operations.\7\ 
In the 6 GHz bands, relocation was not considered.\8\ And in the C-
Band, accelerated relocation will take almost four years to clear the 
band for mobile use.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Sharing generally obviates relocation or can be used where 
relocation is not feasible. Sharing systems can be brought online 
before incumbent operations can be relocated. In cases where the 
incumbent situation is not complex, good, old-fashioned frequency 
coordination is a proven sharing solution.
    There are several new and existing spectrum-sharing technologies 
that should be recalled when identifying bands to repurpose or open to 
shared use. The CBRS SAS and new 6 GHz AFC are examples of spectrum-
sharing systems that will allow for deployment and operation of new 
devices and services without having to relocate incumbent operations.
    Spectrum policy must balance the costs, complexities and time 
frames for making spectrum available on a shared or exclusive basis. We 
note that sharing is not applicable in all cases and we absolutely 
support exclusive licensing.
Establish frameworks for collaboration and cooperation among 
        stakeholders
    The concept of sharing spectrum sets up a potentially adversarial 
relationship between incumbents and new entrants. Incumbents might be 
hesitant to work with new entrants on establishing sharing frameworks 
particularly at the end of lengthy, complex, and possibly contentious 
rulemakings. We have found that intentionally establishing a 
collaborative framework for cooperation among all stakeholders has been 
quite successful in arriving at mutually-agreeable solutions.
    In 2012, NTIA used the CSMAC process to establish a collaboration 
framework between commercial interests and Federal spectrum users in 
the AWS-3 bands (1695-1710 MHz and 1755-1850 MHz). The plan was to 
create working groups that would consider ways to facilitate the 
implementation of commercial wireless broadband into erstwhile Federal 
bands. The working groups produced recommendations to the CSMAC 
concerning approaches to sharing, transition, and/or relocation of the 
band that determined the steps that were ultimately taken and any 
factors that could reduce the projected costs, or limitations or 
restrictions on spectrum availability. These recommendations also 
helped to inform the FCC's AWS-3 rulemaking. This AWS-3 collaboration 
under CSMAC proved to be very successful in helping to craft rules with 
a clearer mutual understanding of how commercial mobile systems can 
coexist with a host of Federal and DoD systems.
    Another direct benefit of this collaboration was the establishment 
of key relationships with Federal spectrum management and policy 
leaders and counterparts. Working with key individuals such as Mr. Fred 
Moorefield, Deputy Chief Information Officer for Command, Control, 
Communications and Computers and Information Infrastructure 
Capabilities, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Chief Information 
Officer and Mr. Tom Taylor, Deputy Director, EMS Operations at DoD CIO, 
and many others, we were able to identify and creatively resolve issues 
in close collaboration with individuals empowered to find solutions.
    Industry collaboration on CBRS among all stakeholders helped 
identify and address issues relatively quickly. These engagements build 
upon the AWS-3 collaboration to the extent that there was good 
familiarity among stakeholders, there was mutual understanding of 
issues and how to collectively address them, and general willingness to 
work through issues together. Again, the relationships we had 
previously established with Mr. Moorefield, Mr. Taylor, and others were 
critical in working through many challenging issues. The FCC concluded 
in a November 2018 report to Congress on the status of CBRS that, 
``[c]ollaboration among all of the stakeholders is excellent.'' \9\ 
CommScope agrees with that assessment and has seen that excellent 
collaboration continue to this day.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    FCC-endorsed multi-stakeholder group (MSG) collaboration on C-Band 
and 6 GHz is relatively new, yet shows promise as a framework to 
coordinate technical discussions among industry stakeholders to achieve 
mutually-agreeable solutions to several difficult technical questions. 
For the C-Band, there are currently four technical working groups 
comprised of some of the industry's best technical experts who are 
addressing potential in-band and adjacent-band coexistence and sharing 
issues. For the 6 GHz band, the FCC encouraged the formation of an MSG 
to study and make recommendations on how to operationalize the AFC and 
address interference issues.
    In order to achieve the spectral efficiency and time to market 
benefits of shared-spectrum regimes and repurposing efforts, 
collaboration among all stakeholders is required.
Consider CSMAC's recommendations, primarily on the National Spectrum 
        Strategy, when examining the respective roles of the FCC and 
        NTIA in spectrum management and policymaking
    CSMAC has been organized since 2004 under the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act. CSMAC advises the Assistant Secretary for Communications 
and Information at NTIA on a broad range of spectrum policy issues. 
CSMAC typically functions through working groups who deliberate on 
specific tasks or questions provided by the NTIA and makes 
recommendations to the Assistant Secretary. CSMAC members are spectrum 
policy experts from outside the Federal government. Committee members 
offer expertise and perspective on reforms to enable new technologies 
and services, including reforms that expedite the American public's 
access to broadband services, public safety, and long-range spectrum 
planning. Members are selected based on their technical background and 
expertise. The current CSMAC charter was renewed in October 2019 and 
expires in September 2021.\10\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In August 2019, the Assistant Secretary provided CSMAC with the 
following question that is directly related to U.S. spectrum policy:

        What should be the United States implementation structure or 
        governance model for the National Spectrum Strategy (NSpcS)? 
        Consider whether the U.S. spectrum management approach is 
        optimized for the implementation of a 21st century national 
        spectrum strategy, and if not, whether there is value in 
        establishing a new approach or structure to accomplish this. If 
        there is value in a new approach or structure, what are its 
        characteristics? \11\

    This working group has been deliberating on this question since 
October 2019. In January 2020, the working group provided a public 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
update on their deliberations:

        There is general agreement among the working group that our 
        country's current approach for managing the use of spectrum is 
        no longer effectively serving the needs of the entire 
        stakeholder community and would benefit from reform. Moreover, 
        with the increased use of spectrum by all stakeholders, we 
        agree that issues around spectrum sharing and band adjacencies 
        will need to be handled with both speed and skill to ensure 
        that the U.S. is making the most of its critical national 
        resources.\12\

    The deliberations of the working group are ongoing and not yet 
public. However, the working group is planning to provide a full report 
on their findings to the Assistant Secretary in the coming months.
Open RAN also will play a significant role in accelerating the rollout 
        of 5G in the U.S. by enabling 5G equipment interoperability.
    In contrast to the existing ``closed'' systems where networks are 
locked to a single vendor, Open RAN (O-RAN) architectures are a new 
model where cellular radio networks are comprised of hardware and 
software components from multiple vendors operating over ``open and 
interoperable'' network interfaces. Although CommScope and other 
industry stakeholders are making significant strides towards O-RAN 
solutions for 5G wireless networks, ongoing standardization and 
implementation research and development must still be done. Given the 
critical role Open RAN can play in advancing 5G, government/industry 
collaboration, including Federal funding, is needed to ensure American 
leadership in O-RAN research and development efforts.
Summary
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify before the 
Subcommittee and thank you for your leadership in driving discussion on 
U.S. spectrum policy.
    U.S. spectrum policy is at the nexus of increased demand for 
spectrum; advanced methods and tools for extracting the maximum use, 
efficiency, and value of spectrum and a blurring of the lines between 
spectrum allocations. Indeed, this is perhaps one of the most 
transitional times in the history of spectrum management.
    I think we all have a role in:

   Assuring quick access to spectrum,

   Incorporation of licensed and unlicensed approaches to 
        spectrum allocation,

   Use of spectrum-sharing approaches where appropriate,

   Ensuring collaboration and cooperation among stakeholders,

   Supporting NTIA's recommendations on the National Spectrum 
        Strategy, and

   Support of Open RAN in the rollout of 5G.

    We look forward to working together to advance U.S. spectrum 
policy.

    Senator Thune. Thank you, Mr. Gibson. Next up is Dr. 
Layton. Welcome.

STATEMENT OF ROSLYN LAYTON, Ph.D., VISITING RESEARCHER, AALBORG 
                           UNIVERSITY

    Ms. Layton. Thank you for this honor and privilege to 
testify on the state of U.S. spectrum policy. The Commerce 
committee has driven reforms to liberalize commercial spectrum 
allocations at the FCC. These practices have become models for 
countries around the world. Reforms include flexible use, 
competitive bidding, spectrum repackaging, and dynamic sharing. 
Without these reforms, our trillion-dollar wireless economy and 
the millions of jobs it powers would not be possible. As this 
committee has improved outcomes for commercial spectrum the 
same can likely be done for the Government. Today, Federal 
spectrum is managed by NTIA and IRAC, the latter founded in 
1922. The management of Federal spectrum is essentially 
unchanged for 98 years and it is time to review it. In the 
1920s, free market common law property rights were alive and 
well for radio spectrum.
    The purpose of the 1927 Radio Act was to end free 
enterprise and enshrine bureaucratic control of the airwaves. 
The practical effect was to make spectrum allocation a 
political decision and to reward favored constituents. By the 
time Nobel Prize economist Ronald Coase wrote his seminal 
articles on the FCC and IRAC, the U.S. had some 40 years of 
administrative allocation. Coase laid the theoretical 
foundation for the market-based spectrum management we know 
today. He described how the prevailing central planning of 
spectrum was wasteful and costly. He debunked the premise that 
Government is needed to limit interference when the same 
function can be done more effectively through pricing.
    Coase's proposals were mocked in his day but experience has 
proven him right. The FCC has helped some 100 spectrum auctions 
and raised over $100 billion for the treasury. There are 
millions of spectrum licenses today, tens of thousands of 
licensees, and an ever-increasing number of uses and there is a 
robust secondary market. However, this optimization only occurs 
on one-third of the relevant spectrum. The rights to the other 
two thirds are held by the Government and this spectrum has a 
limited set of uses and users.
    Spectrum is no different than any other resource. It is 
subject to supply and demand, it can be packaged and priced 
like any other good or service, and moreover, there is no 
reason why Federal agencies which purchase their inputs from 
the market should not pay for their use of spectrum. The first 
best realization of Coase's recommendation is to liberalize the 
underlying resource, privatize the spectrum itself. This would 
entail sunsetting administrative allocation. Privatizing 
Federal spectrum would be worth at least half a trillion 
dollars, maybe more to the U.S. Treasury. Like the incentive 
auction, proceeds from the sale of Federal spectrum could be 
returned to the agencies to help them fund their equipment 
upgrades.
    Today we will hear about a lot of ongoing spectrum 
conflicts within and between industries and Federal agencies. 
This will likely continue. Even though we have liberalized 
allocation within certain spectrum bands, the overall 
designation of these bands is still a bureaucratic decision. 
Second best would be the introduction of a pricing system for 
Federal spectrum. This can be done without dismantling the 
regulatory authorities. For example, FCC licenses commercial 
spectrum. NTIA could do this for Federal spectrum.
    Now while pricing is ideal, it may not be politically 
tenable at this time, but there are ways to bring greater 
discipline and accountability. Chairman Wicker and Senators 
Schatz, Moran, and Udall have this in mind with the SPECTRUM 
NOW Act. This bill addresses the critical lack of mid-band 
spectrum for 5G with the feasibility study of Federal 
efficiency relocation and sharing with commercial users.
    Chairman Wicker's hearing on broadband during the pandemic 
highlighted that networks performed admirably under the crisis, 
but these networks are needed even more. 100 million school 
children face the prospect of distance learning this fall and 
yet policy struggles to allow the purchase of mid-band spectrum 
rights to serve these children with 5G, the quickest and most 
cost effective way to bring connectivity to all, particularly 
rural areas. It is a valid policy question whether the Federal 
Government requires 2500 megahertz or 3600 megahertz of 
beachfront spectrum for radar navigation when we have critical 
civilian needs at stake.
    The record shows that, when under crisis, the military has 
adjusted its uses to accommodate other uses. In any event, 
Federal agencies have been reluctant to share much less 
relinquish their little use frequencies. They have resisted 
Congress's reasonable request for transparency. Maybe market 
actors will have more success. Seven firms have signed up as 
spectrum access system administrators for the 3.5 proceedings. 
One or more of these firms should make a public dashboard so 
that we can see for ourselves how little Federal spectrum is 
used.
    The Federal agencies could be graded on their spectrum 
efficiency and these report cards should be part of the 
Appropriations and agency authorization process. And further, 
this can be helped by the Spectrum Modernization Act sponsored 
by Chairman Wicker and Senators Cantwell, Inhofe, and Reed. 
This bill allows for the modernizing of IT infrastructure for 
Federal spectrum. Thank you, Commerce Committee, for your 
leadership on this issue. I look forward to your questions.

    Thank you, Senator Thune, Ranking Member Schatz, and members of the 
committee. It is an honor and a privilege to testify on the State of 
U.S. Spectrum Policy. This issue which is arguably the most important 
in telecom policy. I hope to highlight some key findings from the 
academic field of spectrum management and policy and preliminary policy 
recommendations maximize the outcomes for the American people. I am an 
American and have enjoyed affiliation with Denmark's Aalborg University 
since 2012 where I earned my PhD and continue my research.\1\ Our 
university hosts doctoral students from around the world who wish to 
make multidisciplinary and international comparisons of telecom policy. 
Our university is ranked by U.S. News and World Report as 4th in the 
world for its overall engineering program and 2nd for Electrical and 
Electronic Engineering.\2\ In addition to my department of 
Communication, Media and Information Technologies, our research and 
educational domains include Antennas, Propagation and Millimeter-wave 
Systems; Automation and Control; Connectivity: Wireless Communication 
Networks; and Signal and Information Processing. We use ``problem-based 
learning'' to examine, teach, and learn about complex, real world 
problems. Spectrum management is a textbook example of a complex real-
world problem for both for the engineering and political requirements. 
My comments reflect my own views.

While it is not the precise theme of this hearing, spectrum management 
has geopolitical implications. Not only does China influence global 
organizations where spectrum decisions are much such at the 
International Telecommunication Union and various technical standards 
organizations, it commands and controls its spectrum policy in a way to 
align military and industrial interests to promote its national 
champions in space/satellite technologies, network equipment, wireless 
devices, software platforms, and emerging technologies such as smart 
cities solutions, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. 
Sometimes U.S. policy appears to pit Federal and commercial interests 
against each other, rather than adopt the market-based approach which 
will put the U.S. on the best technological footing to challenge China 
both economically and militarily.

    The gap between the U.S. and China on mid-band spectrum has been 
noted. Mid-band frequencies, also called the Goldilocks band, are 
prized for their technological capabilities to send large amount of 
data over long distances. China and even Canada are on track to have 
some 500 MHz of mid-band spectrum deployed (and Japan with 1000 MHz), 
whereas the U.S. has a scant 350 MHz. As such, S. 1986, SPECTRUM NOW 
Act sponsored by Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Schatz, and Senators 
Moran and Udall has critical importance. Using the Spectrum Relocation 
Fund, this bill would support Federal entities operating on mid-band 
spectrum to study the feasibility of increasing spectrum efficiency and 
relocating federally held spectrum or sharing it with commercial users 
to facilitate the deployment of 5G.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To put the numbers into perspective, consider that the Federal 
government sits on 70 percent of the so-called spectrum ``beachfront'', 
some 2500 MHz, used primarily for radar and radio navigation. The 
government's holdings amount to more than four times what America's 
five major wireless carriers (T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon, Dish, and U.S. 
Cellular) have in mid-band frequencies for 5G. The U.S. is in an 
existential battle with China for 5G, and it trying to do it on scraps 
of mid-band spectrum.
    5G is the quickest way to equalize the digital divide between urban 
and rural America, providing the same, if not, superior connectivity 
than wireline fiber networks. While there is a promise of some more 
mid-band spectrum in the future, the allocation process for these 
frequencies, which by rights should be have been a quick, speedy 
private transaction, was seized by political actors protecting 
incumbent firms.\6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In any event, if there was a market-based process to allocate 
Federal spectrum, there would be no need to quibble about the 3.7 to 
4.2 MHz, as private actors would have the opportunity to buy, sell, 
lease, trade, or share the most valuable swath of the airwaves. Simply 
put, the Federal spectrum holders are insulated to the pain caused by 
the spectrum imbalance. Policymakers have made a choice to prioritize 
certain Federal (notably military) applications above civilian wants 
and needs. This is not to say military applications are unimportant, 
but it is a valid policy research question of whether all 2500 MHz is 
best deployed for radar and radio navigation when some measure of this 
spectrum could enable over 100 million school children to participate 
in distance learning during the pandemic.
    While no country's spectrum policy is perfect, the U.S. has driven 
important successes over the last century. This Committee has been the 
driving force behind the FCC reforms to liberalize the allocation of 
commercial spectrum, which has become a model for telecom regulators 
around the world. Reforms include a liberalized allocation process for 
commercial spectrum, flexible use, competitive bidding to make rights 
assignments more efficient, and tools and processes to make spectrum 
use more efficient whether repacking spectrum (a result of the 
broadcast incentive auction, for example) or dynamic sharing such as in 
the 3.5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service proceeding. As a result of 
these and other efforts, the FCC has improved the access, availability, 
and efficiency of commercial spectrum, without which our wireless 
economy would not be possible. Over 90 commercial spectrum auctions in 
the U.S. have delivered over $116 billion to the U.S. Treasury.\7\ 
Wireless spectrum enables the trillion-dollar wireless economy. We now 
accept the premise that spectrum is a finite resource for which prices 
and markets can improve their allocation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If such reforms have improved the outcomes for commercial spectrum, 
it stands to reason that similar improvements could be driven for 
Federal spectrum. At the very least this would include improving access 
and availability for Federal users, but more largely, better outcomes 
for the American people. Presently Federal spectrum is managed the 
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and 
more specifically, the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC), 
which was founded in 1922. While commercial spectrum allocation has 
been reformed, the management of Federal spectrum is essentially 
unchanged for almost 100 years. It is timely and appropriate to review 
it.
    Leading telecom economist and former FCC chief economist Thomas 
Hazlett observes, ``The FCC had no idea that mobile would become a mass 
market (not a luxury niche), that handsets would become pocket (not 
car) phones, that texting and data (not just voice) would become 
standard, or that digital was superior to the analog standard it 
mandated. And that was after vast input from scientists, management 
consultants, broadcasters, Motorola, and AT&T.'' \8\ Spectrum markets 
had to be liberalized before innovation and adoption took hold.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To facilitate the buying, selling, and leasing of spectrum, the FCC 
operates a Universal Licensing System (ULS). Indicative of the demand 
for spectrum, has been the increased use of the system. The FCC reports 
some remarkable statistics from the ULS platform, for example the 
thousands of licenses holders (including individuals), the many uses of 
spectrum, and the number of licenses issued annually (more than 150,000 
per year for almost a decade).\9\ The FCC has responded to exploding 
demand for commercial spectrum by modernizing the ULS over a multi-year 
upgrade.

    Indeed, this Committee has already taken important steps to bring 
the IT system for America's Federal users spectrum up to speed. While 
some have observed that having a single system for both Federal and 
commercial spectrum, there are some important differences in the law 
and policy which creates some challenges to run an integrated system. 
For example, some Federal uses may be classified for national security 
reasons and there are not suitable for commercial viewing. On the other 
hand, there are additional levels of data (e.g., precise location of 
infrastructure towers), which are collected for the Federal system but 
are not collected for commercial spectrum (perhaps for competitive 
reasons).
    In any event, there need not be a single system but make a systemic 
improvement in spectrum management. Indeed, there is much that Federal 
users can learn from the FCC's ULS system. I applaud Chairman Wicker 
and Senators Cantwell, Inhofe, and Reed for introducing S. 3717, the 
Spectrum IT Modernization Act which requires NTIA and other Federal 
agencies to outline a plan for modernizing the information technology 
infrastructure used for the management of Federal spectrum, to define 
the parameters of interoperability, and for the Department of Defense 
to report on their challenges of management and utilization.\10\

    Ronald Coase laid the theoretical foundations for market-based 
regimes and challenged the prevailing regulatory wisdom of 
administrative allocation of radio frequencies. His 1959 Federal 
Communications Commission \12\ exposed the fallacy of administrative 
allocation which justified restricting spectrum use to limit 
interference. Coase showed that same function can be performed more 
efficiently through a ``price system.'' In his day, Coase's proposals 
were mocked by policymakers. The first auction for spectrum rights was 
delayed until 1994.\13\

    Today, however, spectrum auctions are practiced around the world 
and are considered de riguer for telecom regulators and spectrum 
authorities. Coase is not alive today, but his Nobel prize and the 
legacy of his work (including the fact that he remains among the most 
cited Nobel prize winners, in law, and in economics \14\) attest that 
he was correct on pricing and radio spectrum. Hazlett, Porter and Smith 
argue that Coase's work on radio spectrum is on par of that of Adam 
Smith's Wealth of Nations for its bringing ``disruptive clarities to 
system dynamics.'' \15\ They note that Coase dispensed with Pigou's 
notions of externality and spillover, showing that central planning was 
not costless. Moreover, Coase demonstrated the destructive fallacy of 
assigning rights by government fiat, noting that how the airwaves were 
used and who used them were not one in the same.\16\ The existence of 
secondary markets prove that the creation of rights and its assignment 
are separable.\17\ An additional irony and inequality is that the 
Federal government is primary holder of spectrum rights, but is not the 
primary user. This suggests that additional optimization is possible.

    The ``First Best'' realization of Coase's recommendation is to 
liberalize the underlying resource--privatizing the spectrum itself--
not just the use and licensing regime. This would entail sunsetting 
administrative allocation, also called command and control. A 1996 
policy proposal suggested that the sale of Federal spectrum holdings 
could generate as much as $300 billion (almost half a trillion in 
today's dollars) to pay down the national debt and transition the 
administrative allocation regime to privatization within a decade.\19\

    Indeed, a common law property rights regime for spectrum had 
already emerged before the Federal Radio Act of 1927. I review this 
briefly, but as it is outside today's scope, I will describe ``Second 
Best'' options, notably spectrum fees. I provide additional suggestions 
for transparency, accountability, and IRAC reforms.
    In recent years Congress has had success to reform Executive Branch 
agencies, most recently with the Foreign Investment Risk Review 
Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) for the Committee on Foreign 
Investment in the US. (CFIUS). This reform was achieved within a single 
session of Congress and was overwhelmingly bipartisan. It represents 
one of the most significant Congressional efforts to improve national 
security by requiring that CFIUS screen foreign investment for 
cybersecurity and privacy implications. Already it resulted in the 
halting, if not reversal, of foreign acquisitions of MoneyGram, 
PatientsLikeMe, Grindr, and StayNTouch because of concerns that that 
Americans' personal data would fall into the hands of the Chinese 
government. Importantly, FIRRMA requires greater accountability of 
CFIUS to Congress, as it was observed that Congress' concerns about 
security threats had been discounted by the Executive Branch in the 
past in an effort to effect quick transactions.\20\ It is entirely 
appropriate that Congress and the Commerce Committee assert greater 
authority over Federal spectrum, which after all, is what the 
Constitution prescribes.

Common law property rights for spectrum
    Spectrum markets were already working before the creation of the 
1927 Federal Radio Act. The government created a solution that the 
market didn't need, but it did serve to cement Federal power over the 
radio spectrum and protect politically favored incumbents. Up to that 
time, hundreds of radio stations flourished under common law tenets, 
and a secondary market emerged with transferring rights with equipment. 
Parties met annually under the auspices of the Department of Commerce 
to make trades.
    Thomas Hazlett details this little-known spectrum history in a 
recent article, showing that a common law property rights regime was 
well-established before the implementation of the Act.\21\ Hazlett 
challenges the conventional view that policymakers of the day didn't 
have information of how a spectrum rights market could work and 
therefore opted for administrative allocation. Hazlett shows that 
Senator Clarence Dill (D-WA) and the bill's supporters knew exactly 
what they were doing. Moreover, Hazlett uses market data from the 1920s 
to demonstrate how the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) and 
Radio Corporation of America (RCA) benefitted from the new regime, 
which limited competitive entry into the market, secured licenses to 
existing broadcasters, and ensured a stream of revenue for radio 
receivers. Indeed, Hazlett observers how the term ``public interest'' 
was coined by private actors to protect their market position.

    The U.S. Department of Commerce had powers granted under the 1912 
Radio Act to ``minimize interference.'' It used a common law method to 
recognize first-in-time emission rights and to protect against 
encroachment. Stations that strayed from their registered frequencies 
were closed with the Department of Commerce's police powers. Commerce 
convened an annual conference where emergent players organized. Hazlett 
describes,

        Commerce had designated an AM radio band, collaborating with 
        radio manufacturers and broadcast stations in annual Radio 
        Conferences that were convened by the Commerce Department from 
        1922 through 1925 (Benjamin 1998). Entrants that requested new 
        rights were assigned vacant AM channels. Where none were 
        available, applicants were told to strike a time-sharing 
        agreement with an existing licensee or to buy a station, in 
        which case the transmission rights would be transferred (with 
        the broadcasting facility) to the new owner. The chief sponsor 
        of the 1927 Radio Act, Sen. Clarence C. Dill (D-WA), explained 
        that the legal institution employed by Commerce was well known 
        as ``property by right of user,'' ``squatter sovereignty,'' or 
        ``adverse possession'' (Dill 1938, p. 78). Under this regime, 
        over 500 radio stations were broadcasting--which created a new 
        mass media market--with substantial investments of private 
        capital. In early 1926, a trade union in Chicago, intent on 
        launching radio station WCFL, had the option to buy the 
        broadcasting rights of three different local stations, 
        including that of WHT, which was asking $285 000 (Godfried 
        1997, p. 33). In September 1926, AT&T sold its New York City 
        radio station, WEAF, for $1 million to the Radio Corporation of 
        America (RCA), of which $800,000 was for the value of spectrum 
        rights (Barnouw 1966, pp. 185-186).'' \22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \22\ ``Two major interests sought a new regime that would grant 
regulators greater discretion: On the one hand, successful commercial 
stations sought to limit competitive entry. In the 1925 formation of 
the National Association of Broadcasters--a trade group that 
represented incumbent broadcasting stations--the industry created a 
novel standard for rights assignment. ``An interesting fact,'' wrote 
Senator Dill, is that the broadcasters themselves suggested the 
inclusion of the words ``public interest'' in the law as a basis for 
granting licenses'' (Dill 1938, p. 89). On the other hand, policy 
makers--such as Hoover, Dill, and other members of Congress--desired to 
assert political authority over what they recognized as an influential 
new medium of public opinion. License awards were said to be mandated 
as a consequence of nature, and licensing authority was then leveraged 
to include administrative oversight of speech and the press; this 
skirted constitutional limits that were binding elsewhere (Hazlett 
1998).''

    Data from the period shows that the common law regime worked such 
that consumers purchased radios (which amounted to $1000 in today's 
money) at a brisk pace. However, to create the needed ``chaos'' in the 
airwaves which would support the bill, then Commerce Secretary Herbert 
Hoover cancelled the annual conference and stopped enforcing rights. 
The subsequent interference ``chaos'' that ensued was seized by the 
press and policymakers as justification for the new law.
    Hazlett notes that 1927 Act was decidedly against property rights. 
The statute states that while it will consider the ``use'' of spectrum, 
its purpose is to ``pre-empt the assertion of private property rights 
in radio spectrum.'' The law further prescribes that ``No station or 
license shall be granted . . . until the applicant therefore shall have 
signed a waiver of any claim to the use of any particular frequency or 
wave length or of the ether as against the regulatory power of the 
United States because of the previous use of the same, whether by 
license or otherwise.'' The 1927 Radio Act did not ``stumble'' into 
administrative allocation of frequencies but sought a regime change. 
The prospect of property rights in frequencies was not a foreign 
concept. Indeed, a system of priority-in-use rights for radio 
broadcasts was in play since the first radio station, KDKA in 
Pittsburgh in 1920.
    The Act launched the regime of administrative licensing or command 
and control spectrum management. The government served as the clearing 
house for spectrum, its proffered benefit being the control of 
interference by exclusivity to protect the licensee's signals. To get a 
license, the applicant would participate in a ``beauty contest'' to 
show why its service did a better job to realize the ``public 
interest'' than another. There was no fee based on an estimated value 
of the spectrum. Such a model emphasizes the political rewards of 
spectrum assignment which accrue to the licensing body and the 
licensee. Moreover, it incentivizes the application to overpromise to 
win the application but underdeliver once received.
    Naturally, command and control offers some marginal economic 
benefits (some use of the spectrum is better than none at all), but it 
is not optimal. Some countries have attempted to rectify perceived 
political bias through spectrum lottery, but this also fails to 
rationally reflect the economic contest by competing actors for a 
scarce resource. The command and control regime was further legitimized 
by the 1943 Supreme Court decision NBC v. FCC asserting that there is 
not enough spectrum for everyone and that there is a finite natural 
limit of radio stations that can operate without interference.
    Hazlett offers further history and analysis The Political Spectrum: 
The Tumultuous Liberation of Wireless Technology, from Herbert Hoover 
to the Smartphone.\23\ He documents systematic deterrence of new 
technology by bureaucracy. He blames not the regulators themselves, 
individuals who want new technologies, but the ''administrative 
apparatus'' and ''regulatory gridlock'' to access unused spectrum, 
requiring potential licensee to file an application, detail the 
business plan, and demonstrate the technology before it is ever tried. 
Moreover, the applicant must prove that the technology will serve the 
''public interest, convenience, and necessity.'' Incumbents can nix 
technologies they believe to be threatening. It can take a decade or 
more to bring a new technology to market. Most innovators fail, and 
many pass away unrecognized, bankrupted, and demoralized.

Problems with Administrative Allocation
    Coase critiqued IRAC or what he termed ``governmental 
administrative machinery'', the ``complex process of bargaining and 
accommodation,'' and the ``widespread feeling of dissatisfaction with 
the way the present arrangements are working.'' \24\ He noted that IRAC 
allocates too much spectrum to government departments and too little to 
private users. Coase took issue with IRAC's policy of ``first come, 
first served,'' calling it a system in which ``those who are first 
granted the use of a radio frequency are not easily displaced by a 
newcomer'' (p. 37). Coase noted that IRAC's assignments are rarely 
disturbed. ``What this implies is that radio frequencies are used by 
Government departments for purposes which have a relatively low value 
as compared with what are the same frequencies would be worth if they 
could be made available to a private user,'' says Coase. By contrast, 
we can see that since the FCC adopted market-based reforms, assignments 
are frequently changing as license holders trade up for better uses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \24\ Coase quotes Dr. Irvin Stewart, then Chairman of the 
Communications Policy Board (xx of IRAC) and was to become Director of 
Telecommunications Management: ``It is a body composed of users. The 
situation is one in which naturally there is a desire to accommodate 
the wishes of the users who participate. There is nobody sitting in the 
position of arbiter. There is nobody who can ask too many hard 
questions. There is nobody who has an overriding task of requiring that 
the necessity for a particular new assignment be established in light 
of all the assignments that have been made in the past. . . . It is 
natural for each Government department to emphasize the importance of 
its role; and there isn't inherent in the situation any necessary 
motivation to conserve frequencies in order that they might be 
available for only-Government use. In many cases in the assignment of 
frequencies, security considerations must be taken into account, and 
that means that justifications for the assignments cannot be made a 
matter of record. And then when you have no public record, you have 
another fertile ground for suspicion'' (Hearings on Spectrum Allocation 
p. 33-34).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Coase ascribed the challenge for IRAC in part to the downsides of 
central planning, observing,

        The experience in the United States with the administrative 
        structure which has been devised to handle the allocation of 
        radio frequencies illustrates very vividly one of the dilemmas 
        of planning. The attempt to control everything from the center 
        is liable to lead to paralysis. The delegation of control leads 
        to inconsistency of action. If central control is instituted, 
        the necessity of referring all questions to the center involves 
        expense in compiling and transmitting information and delay 
        before decisions can be made. Nor are the decisions necessarily 
        better when they are made. The remoteness of the center from 
        the areas affected by the decision may lead to a failure to 
        understand the significance of the issues under consideration . 
        . . The division of control of the allocation of radio 
        frequencies between the FCC and IRAC has no doubt led to misuse 
        of radio frequencies. It may well have resulted in too great an 
        allocation of radio frequencies in total for the use of 
        Government departments. But there is every reason to suppose 
        that an attempt to avoid such misallocation by extending the 
        powers of the FCC to cover Government stations or by 
        establishing a new Board to supervise the allocation of 
        frequencies to Government departments (using procedures similar 
        to those of the FCC) or by setting up a single super Board to 
        control the allocation of all frequencies in the United States, 
        would impose additional expense and delay and would bring about 
        new misallocation. It is no doubt desirable to realize the 
        inefficiencies inherent in the present system. (p. 39)

    It is interesting to note that there have been multiple attempts to 
improve allocation of government spectrum, even an idea from the 1930s 
that the FCC would allocate the government frequencies. ``But this move 
was resisted by the Government departments, particularly the military 
departments, and the final result of success reorganization was to 
place the FCC, if anything, in a subordinate rather than dominant 
position,'' notes Coase (p. 38). Moreover, in the realpolitik of 
spectrum among Federal agencies, there are political payoffs which 
never appear on the balance sheet. Spectrum can be a valuable token 
when budgets and other assets are limited. As such keeping some 
spectrum issues unresolved allows them to used for later trades.
The Case for Spectrum Fees
    Coase thought that private and government users should pay for 
spectrum. He described the simplicity and superiority of a pricing 
system over administration allocation, how it eliminates waste and 
misuse, and how it would deliver better outcomes in the national 
interest. He described, quite plainly in 1962, that the demand for the 
scarce resource of spectrum exceeds supply:

        In the case of radio frequencies, as the price that is charged 
        at the present time is, of course, zero, it is hardly 
        surprising that we find a situation in which there is an excess 
        of demand over supply and there is need for some governmental 
        administrative machinery to decide who among the many claimants 
        shall be granted this valuable resource. Those in positions of 
        authority who deal with the problems of allocating the radio 
        spectrum act as if they were unaware that the rest of the 
        American economic system largely works on different principles. 
        (p. 42)

    Coase then described why a pricing system is superior to 
administrative allocation, noting that,

        . . . resources are obtained by those who will pay the most for 
        them. Since the amount which a user will pay for a resource 
        reflects the value of that resource in whatever employment he 
        is contemplating using it, the pricing system tends to result 
        in that allocation of a resource between its various uses which 
        maximizes the value of production. If a price had to be paid 
        for radio frequencies, government departments would not use 
        them unless they felt that, by spending their money in this 
        way, it would serve the purposes of the department better than 
        by spending that money in any other way. And if the price was 
        made sufficiently high so as to bring the demand for radio 
        frequencies into equality with the supply, this would both 
        eliminate the need for an administrative allocation and ensure 
        radio frequencies were used for those governmental purposes 
        which justified the greatest monetary sacrifice (p. 41).

    Coase understood the economics of information and observed that 
government users

        would be naturally reluctant to disclose information which 
        might result in their having to relinquish any radio 
        frequencies. It is one of the advantages of the pricing system 
        that, for its efficient working, the only person who needs to 
        know about how any given user would use radio frequencies is 
        the user himself. He has to decide how much it is worth his 
        while to offer for a certain radio frequency: whether he 
        obtains it depends on what others are willing to offer. (p. 43) 
        . . . The absence of a market price (which measure the value of 
        a frequency to another user in another use) means that a user 
        has little idea of when he is using a frequency ``wastefully'' 
        and no financial inducement to find out. Obviously, a frequency 
        should not be used for a particular purpose if it prevents the 
        accomplishment of some other purpose of greater value or if the 
        same purpose could be achieved by the use of another resource 
        which would mean a smaller fall in the value of production than 
        the use of the frequency. It is clear that such wasteful use 
        must be very common with the existing system. Any user with the 
        existing system will not willingly surrender frequencies that 
        he has been allocated so long as their use (or potential use) 
        has a value greater than zero and this even though there may be 
        others to whom the frequency has higher value (p 45).

    Coase described that a pricing system for spectrum would benefit 
the military and the Nation. ``The introduction of a market would tend 
to bring the interest of the military departments and the national 
interest into a closer conformity,'' he wrote (p.44) Coase noted that 
spectrum usage fees could be made available for short or long terms and 
that this did not preclude the addition of other regulation.
    Accessing fees on government agencies is logical and rational. Just 
as agencies procure resources from the market (labor, building rental, 
electricity), they should also pay for spectrum. A fee regime can be 
implemented without requiring the government to divest its spectrum 
ownership. Though it still requires some administration, it is an 
improvement because it brings pricing discipline. Spectrum regulator 
Ofcom in the United Kingdom implemented a fee regime in 2007.\25\ The 
goal was to nudge agencies to return their lightly used spectrum. While 
the agencies ended up requesting the funds to purchase the frequencies 
outright, the regime brings greater attention and accountability to 
resource management and forces the agencies to acknowledge the value of 
spectrum.

    Some might resist a fee regime for spectrum on the ground that the 
U.S. military has been rendered less effective by the bureaucratic 
``accountability police''.\26\ However it is not logical nor rational 
that the military (or any Federal agency) acquire all of its inputs 
(land, labor, weapons etc.) through a market process, but not a 
problem. The bureaucratization of the military is a separate problem, 
but it is no excuse to a continue the command and control regime that 
diminishes the effectiveness of spectrum policy and discourages the 
military from being a responsible spectrum user.

IRAC and Reform
    Conflict within and between NTIA/IRAC and FCC is not new. Over the 
decades there have been a series of political struggles. This will 
likely continue as long as spectrum is allocated by administrators, not 
the market. Policymakers should not invest hope that there is some 
magical institutional design that can resolve the conflicts. It is 
natural and predictable that incumbent industrial and government 
interests will use institutions to maintain the status quo and protect 
their position, which appears to be the case with the proposals under 
development by Commerce Spectrum Management Advisory Committee (CSMAC) 
for ``new'' versions of NTIA, FCC, or a unified spectrum authority.\27\

Sustainable Spectrum Strategy for America's Future: Governance'' (CSMAC

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Indeed, leaders have been well aware of the consequences of the 
IRAC policy choice. Reflecting on his role leading the organization, 
E.M. Webster described IRAC in 1945 noting,

        The IRAC is unique among government agencies in that it came 
        into being, not as the result of action by either the executive 
        or legislative branches of the government, but spontaneously 
        through a demand of the interested government agencies . . . 
        These people represent their respective agencies whenever 
        frequencies are involved, but it should be emphasized that, 
        while each is acting to some extent as an individual, he is 
        primarily the medium of policy expression for his 
        organization.\28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \28\ E. M. Webster, ``The Interdepartment Radio Advisory 
Committee,'' in Proceedings of the IRE, vol. 33, no. 8, pp. 495-499, 
Aug. 1945, doi: 10.1109/JRPROC.1945.230506.

    This statement dispels the view that IRAC acts collectively on 
behalf of the American people. Rather it is designed to further the 
interest of vested Federal agencies. Today's members include the Air 
Force, Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Broadcasting Board of Governors, 
Federal Aviation Administration; the Postal Service, the National 
Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 
and the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Homeland Security, Interior, 
Justice, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs. The FCC 
is only a liaison. Observers include the Department of Defense, the 
Food and Drug Administration, and the National Security Agency.
    Webster recounts the debate on the need for trials on vacuum tubes 
versus arc transmitters and how the government would dispose of 
obsolete radio equipment from World War II (lest it continued to be 
used and cause interference.) He observed how the agency spent 
significant time regulating small pieces of spectrum, which in 
retrospect was a waste as new technology from the private sector made 
government choices obsolete. He recognized that Federal spectrum 
holders needed to be more tolerant of interference and that receivers 
needed to be improved.
    Webster observed that the conduct of war is not for the military 
alone. Many actors which need to use the spectrum when the Nation is at 
war, especially domestic and international broadcasters. He noted that 
the government's use of spectrum must by necessity be constrained. If 
the use of spectrum is limited for government during war, it must 
certainly be limited during times of peace, and it must be shared for 
communications, aviation, navigation, public safety, forestry, channels 
for allies, and so on. He noted how during wartime that government 
users had to shuffle and relinquish rights and accept higher levels of 
interference. Given limited frequencies, a set of priority use was 
established. This is an important lesson for today's pandemic. 
Households and business are economizing during a financial crisis. 
There is no reason why the Department of Defense should not examine how 
to make better use of its $800 billion budget. Indeed, pricing could 
help NTIA and IRAC make better decisions and reduce internal conflict 
among competing agencies.
    Webster described IRAC's decision guidelines as the protocols of 
priority use, freedom from harmful interference, and precedence. He 
described detailed decision making at the agency which requires it to 
assess many factors when making spectrum allocation including

  a.  Rule of law as defined by agreements and records, Executive 
        Orders, IRAC minutes and records, international and interagency 
        agreements;

  b.  National interest, where in consideration is given to relative 
        need for the frequency in question and to the degree of 
        utilization by the agencies involved;

  c.  Necessity for using radio, taking into consideration the 
        availability of other means of communication;

  d.  Expansion. Here, in the interest of planned and orderly 
        utilization of the radio spectrum, the Committee recognizes the 
        desirability of providing for normal expansion of a service 
        where it is shown by the applicant that expansion will occur, 
        and where its trend and magnitude can be estimated;

  e.  Geographical priority, which, as applied to mobile stations, is 
        construed to extend only to the geographical area specified at 
        the time the frequency was assigned; as applied to a fixed 
        station, it extends only to the geographic allocation of the 
        points of communication designated in the authorization;

  f.  Dates of assignment and first use, where other considerations are 
        substantially equal, establish the priority as between stations 
        unless by the terms of an agreement it is specifically provided 
        otherwise. To the end that there be most efficient utilization 
        of the radio spectrum, acceptance of a radio-frequency 
        assignment imposes definite obligations on the assignee with 
        respect both to equipment and to use. Some of these are 
        specified in treaties and laws.

    Additionally, the organization was obligated to

  a.  To use the best and most selective radio apparatus the state of 
        the art and service operating requirements permit;

  b.  To use frequencies economically by avoiding unnecessary emissions 
        and conducting operations on a minimum number of frequencies;

  c.  To share frequencies between agencies as a recognized and 
        necessary expedient for the fullest utilization of the radio 
        spectrum.

    These requirements are interesting in light of today's interagency 
conflicts. For one, the pricing mechanism would eliminate much of the 
``administrative machinery'' Coase described, but also, it is not 
evident that Federal agencies even follow IRAC's rules. For example, 
the former Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering 
Michael D. Griffin in the Department of Defense noted that the 
military's GPS receivers will not fulfil military grade expectations 
until 2035.\29\ Government agencies have made technological choices 
which are not emissions-efficient, and rather than using a ``minimum'' 
number of frequencies, they claim to need more than they have, even 
challenging private rights' holders. Moreover, the notion that agencies 
need to share the scarce spectrum resources is belied by government 
behavior which challenges new uses.

    While Congress has vested authority in NTIA and IRAC, there could 
be an issue in the violation of the nondelegation doctrine in that 
Congress has devolved too much power and function to the Executive 
Branch on an issue which it is constitutionally bound to exercise 
itself.\30\ Spectrum is at the heart of interstate commerce, which is 
clearly an Article I responsibility, and one of critical importance to 
the people of the United States.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Aside from public choice and rule of law questions about IRAC, its 
governance today consists of some 20 Federal agencies whereas the 
``public'' (purportedly consumers) is represented only by the FCC, 
which does not enjoy the same standing or power as the other agencies. 
IRAC's proceedings are not fully public, and it appears to be subject 
only to limited Congressional oversight and judicial review (other than 
the oversight of the individual member agencies). As such, most 
spectrum remains under legacy rules and is unavailable to satisfy the 
highest-valued demands of consumers.
    It is not even clear that NTIA and IRAC are fulfilling their duty 
to inform the White House of their activities. The requirement to 
develop a Sustainable Spectrum Strategy is one of many requests from 
the President which has not been delivered, or at least not made 
public.\31\

Strategy for America's Future,'' The White House, October 25, 2018, 
https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-
memorandum-developing-sustainable-spectrum-strategy-americas-future/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Congress should consider the introduction of a pricing system for 
Federal users which reflects the market value of the spectrum. Failing 
this, Congress should consider reforms so that the American people are 
duly represented in IRAC, or at least to bring more accountability to 
its decisions. The recommendations in the subsequent section begin to 
address this problem. Simply put, having more spectrum in use by 
private actors makes our country richer, increases gross domestic 
product, and provides valuable services to consumers and producers.
Second Best Options
Transparency of spectrum use
    Senator Mike Lee's (R-UT) proposed the Government Spectrum 
Valuation Act which would task NTIA, the Office of Management and 
Budget, and the FCC to estimate the value of relative spectrum for 
licensed or unlicensed and report what is assigned and allocated to 
each agency.\32\ Coase explained why government users will resist such 
an effort, and unsurprisingly this common-sense bill has not moved 
forward. However, such a study need not be stymied by lack of 
legislative support. The National Science Foundation (NSF), for 
example, could conduct the study, though without access to NTIA's 
underlying information, NSF would only be able to provide estimates.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Market actors could help bring transparency to opaque government 
spectrum usage. The FCC has approved seven Spectrum Access System 
Administrators (SAS) for the 3.5 GHz band.\33\ One or more of these 
administrators could create a public dashboard of frequencies to show 
how little Federal spectrum is used. This promises to show the 
opportunity cost of leaving spectrum fallow when so many actors are 
willing to use it more efficiently and pay for the right to do so. Some 
350 firms have signed up to participate in the forthcoming 3.5 GHz 
auction in which the FCC offers three payment tiers to access 70 MHz of 
valuable but little used Federal spectrum.\34\ Given the plethora of 
firms willing to pay significantly for spectrum access, the FCC should 
consider implementing a similar tiered framework for the 6 GHz band, 
which otherwise is a giveaway to America's richest software companies 
during a time of national financial crisis.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Report Cards
    The Congressional Budget Office could play a role not only to 
estimate the opportunity cost of little used Federal spectrum but could 
issue report cards on agencies for their efficiency of spectrum use. 
Spectrum stewardship could be included as part of the review criteria 
for appropriations and authorization. Reports cards need not be 
developed by government actors. Private and academic actors could 
contribute on this instrument.
Examination of interference studies
    Recent spectrum conflicts offer a valuable policy research 
opportunity to test the purported claims of interference. Many agencies 
have portended Y2K-like disaster scenarios from FCC decisions on 
commercial spectrum.\35\ As some time has elapsed since these 
proceedings and services have been deployed, it is valuable to see 
whether the predictions proved true, were mitigated as the FCC 
described, or never come to pass. This is also a legitimate area of 
study for the FCC's Office of Economics and Analytics and NTIA's 
Institute for Telecommunications Sciences.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Spectrum policy choices have economic and national security 
consequences. While market reforms have helped correct misguided 
historical choices for spectrum decisions, many features of command and 
control administrative allocation remain. Today, many parties are 
unsatisfied. Nearly every industry and Federal agency would like more 
spectrum but can't get it. Inefficient use is encouraged; new 
technologies are deterred; and Americans are denied new jobs and 
services in the wireless domain.
    The most cited academic literature and experience shows the value 
of market-based allocations of spectrum. The first best policy choice 
for consumers is to privatize the spectrum itself and sunset 
administrative allocation. However, the second-best policy choice of 
the introduction of a market-based pricing system while regulators 
remain has been a success in the commercial domain.
    The template for Federal spectrum allocation is essentially 
unchanged for a century. Bringing pricing discipline to Federal users 
would be a quantum leap from the status quo and would improve outcomes 
for Federal users and Americans. It could be implemented without having 
to reboot existing agencies.
    With the SPECTRUM Now Act and the Spectrum IT Modernization Act, 
this Committee is taking important steps to bring Federal spectrum 
allocation into the 21st century and building on proven success of 
improved management and efficiency of commercial spectrum. A 
feasibility study of increasing Federal spectrum efficiency and 
relocating federally held spectrum and/or sharing it with commercial 
users to facilitate the deployment of 5G is much needed. Similarly, 
modernizing the IT infrastructure for Federal spectrum can also help to 
bring transparency and improved decision-making.

   STATEMENT OF MICHAEL CALABRESE, DIRECTOR, WIRELESS FUTURE 
       PROJECT, OPEN TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE AT NEW AMERICA

    Mr. Calabrese. Thank you and good morning Chairman Thune, 
Ranking Member Schatz, and members of the Subcommittee. The 
Subcommittee's focus today on spectrum policy comes at a 
critical time. The pandemic has only reinforced both high 
capacity and affordable broadband connectivity are essential 
for working, learning, and living well at home.
    As the world goes wireless, the demand for mobile 
connectivity and spectrum is surging. While this suggests that 
spectrum capacity is scarce, the reality is that smart spectrum 
policy can unlock an abundance of bandwidth by authorizing 
dynamic spectrum sharing in a larger number of underutilized 
bands. In recent years, the FCC has made enormous progress in 
opening Federal and commercial bands for more intensive shared 
use through policy innovations that have put the U.S. on a path 
to the world's most robust 5G wireless ecosystem. A leading 
example is a new citizens broadband radio service.
    CBRS uses sensing and a geolocation database to coordinate 
the sharing of Federal spectrum with U.S. Navy radar which 
continues undisturbed. In addition, the database also 
facilitates a use it or share it rule that authorizes the 
temporary use of unused priority access licensed spectrum by 
any other operator both now and indefinitely following the PAL 
auctions that began today. This use it or share it approach 
should be applied to other underutilized bands. As a default 
rule, it can put vacant spectrum to use in rural, tribal, and 
other underserved areas where it is needed most.
    Another world leading example of the FCC's innovative 
leadership is its unanimous vote in April to authorize 
unlicensed use of unused spectrum across the entire 6 gigahertz 
band, a total of 1200 megahertz. Chairman Pai and his 
colleagues deserve enormous credit for recognizing that with 
shared access to the entire 6 gigahertz band, next generation 
Wi-Fi can accelerate the availability and affordability of 
innovative new 5G applications and services such as telehealth 
and augmented reality. Enabling gigabit fast Wi-Fi 6 will 
quickly benefit all homes, businesses, and schools, including 
in rural small town and less affluent areas that are unlikely 
to see mobile carrier 5G build-out for many years.
    Two issues remain pending on 6 gigahertz that are central 
to the value of Wi-Fi 6 for consumers. One is power levels. A 
modest increase is needed for indoor only use so that gigabit 
fast Wi-Fi routers can continue to cover the typical home and 
small business reliably and at a reasonable cost. The other is 
the authorization of very low power devices such as connected 
glasses and other wearables that consumers can use indoors and 
outdoors unburdened by a requirement to be under the control of 
the geolocation database. Because sharing and reorganizing 
spectrum bands have become the new normal, it is crucial that 
the FCC and NTIA cooperate more closely than ever to unlock 
unused spectrum. An example is the nearly vacant 5.9 gigahertz 
band allocated 20 years ago for auto safety but still idling 
empty.
    We strongly support the FCC's proposal to reallocate at 
least the lower portion of the band for unlicensed use. The FCC 
should also consider relocating auto safety applications to the 
nearly vacant public safety band at 4.9 gigahertz, thereby 
removing the roadblock to a contiguous Wi-Fi superhighway. As 
the 5.9 and 6 gigahertz debates demonstrate, because all very 
useful spectrum is occupied, the FCC faces the adamant 
opposition of incumbents in every proceeding aimed at opening 
up unused spectrum.
    These spectrum turf wars, intentions are particularly 
discouraging on the Federal side for two key reasons. First, 
because the FCC is the expert agency in the best position to 
evaluate competing technical studies related to the risk of 
truly harmful interference. And second, the number and 
intensity of recent disputes suggest a lack of effective 
consultation and coordination. My written testimony suggest 
four changes that can greatly improve the functioning of our 
Nation's split system for governing spectrum.
    And finally, the FCC or Congress should immediately extend 
the tribal priority window for access to vacant 2.5 gigahertz 
spectrum set to expire August 3. Thank you for inviting me to 
testify today.

  Prepared Statement of Michael Calabrese, Director, Wireless Future 
           Project, Open Technology Institute at New America
Introduction
    Good morning Chairmen Wicker and Thune, Ranking Members Cantwell 
and Schatz, and members of the Subcommittee. My name is Michael 
Calabrese. I direct the Wireless Future Project at New America's Open 
Technology Institute (OTI), a nonprofit policy institute based here in 
Washington, D.C. I have also served since 2009 on the Department of 
Commerce Spectrum Management Advisory Committee (CSMAC). My 
organization develops and advocates for policies to promote universal, 
faster and more affordable wireless broadband connectivity, broadband 
competition, and more efficient spectrum use with a focus on expanding 
unlicensed access and dynamic spectrum sharing. OTI is also a member of 
the broad-based Public Interest Spectrum Coalition (PISC) that includes 
national consumer, civil rights, education, rural broadband and social 
justice organizations.
    The Subcommittee's focus on spectrum management comes at a critical 
time. The pandemic has highlighted how vital it is for every household 
to have an affordable fixed broadband connection, as well as the 
higher-capacity Wi-Fi needed to distribute that connectivity to the 
workers, students and others sharing those connections. At the same 
time, the Nation is beginning a transition to 5G mobile networks and a 
broader, complementary 5G wireless ecosystem that will include millions 
of high-capacity and customized networks deployed by individual 
business firms and households to meet their particular needs at a lower 
cost.
    As the world goes wireless, the demand for wireless connectivity 
and spectrum continues to increase rapidly. Cisco's annual report on 
Internet usage projects that mobile data traffic in North America will 
continue to grow at a compound annual growth rate exceeding 36 percent 
through 2022.\1\ Wi-Fi data consumption on mobile devices is growing at 
an even faster 45 percent annual rate.\2\ The demand for spectrum 
capacity will grow further as the Internet of Things (IoT) emerges and 
machine-to-machine (M2M) data transfers require more and more capacity. 
Cisco estimates that as M2M applications develop and grow--through 
operations including ``smart meters, video surveillance, healthcare 
monitoring, transportation, and package or asset tracking.'' \3\ By 
2023, M2M connections are expected to represent 50 percent of all 
devices and connections.

    This surging demand and several contentious FCC proceedings to 
allocate more spectrum for 5G has created an impression that spectrum 
is scarce. It is true that the low- and mid-band spectrum most valuable 
for wide-area mobile services has become more and more difficult to 
clear and repurpose for exclusive licensing, as we saw recently with 
the protracted debate over clearing and auctioning unused C-band 
spectrum. However, contrary to assumptions of scarcity, smart and 
forward-looking spectrum policy can unlock an abundance of wireless 
bandwidth in a larger number of underutilized bands through dynamic 
spectrum sharing.
    The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology 
(PCAST) forecast this new reality in 2012, concluding that a new 
paradigm can ``unlock the data-carrying capacity of spectrum in an 
unprecedented way.'' \4\ The PCAST report concluded: ``The essential 
element of this new Federal spectrum architecture is that the norm for 
spectrum use should be sharing, not exclusivity.'' \5\ This ``new 
normal,'' as the PCAST report saw it, is a reason the FCC, NTIA and 
Federal users need to collaborate more than ever to unlock unused 
spectrum capacity in more frequency bands. Their close cooperation is 
needed to support the Nation's progress in deploying mobile 5G 
services, high-capacity fixed wireless connections, and next generation 
Wi-Fi 6 networks that all together will consume exponentially more data 
over the years ahead.

The FCC's World-Leading Innovation in Spectrum Sharing
    In recent years the FCC has made enormous progress in unleashing 
underutilized spectrum in occupied bands for both licensed and 
unlicensed use. Both Federal and commercial bands have been opened for 
more intensive shared use through policy innovations that have put the 
U.S. on a path to the world's most robust 5G wireless ecosystem. A 
leading example is the new Citizens Broadband Radio Service, which 
began commercial operations earlier this year.
    CBRS is doubly innovative as a framework that can be tailored to 
additional occupied but underutilized bands to unlock low-cost 
capacity. CBRS authorizes both licensed and opportunistic (lightly-
licensed) access to unused spectrum in the 3550-3700 MHz band long used 
for U.S. Navy radar systems. The CBRS rules authorize the certification 
of multiple frequency coordination systems--called Spectrum Access 
Systems (SAS)--to govern a dynamic framework for spectrum sharing among 
a three-tier hierarchy of users: incumbent licensees (primarily U.S. 
Navy radar), Priority Access Licenses (PALs), and opportunistic 
(effectively unlicensed) General Authorized Access (GAA) users. 
Multiple, competing SASs are responsible for ensuring incumbent 
services are fully protected from harmful interference and that PAL 
operators are protected from each other and from GAA users.
    In addition, the rules for CBRS include a use-it-or-share-it 
provision that authorize any operator to coordinate access to unused 
PAL spectrum on an opportunistic basis--both now and indefinitely 
following the PAL auctions that began today. The automated frequency 
coordinator (SAS) ensures that opportunistic GAA use of unused PAL 
spectrum in a local area will not interfere with the priority access 
licensee. The SAS database thereby facilitates--on an automated basis 
at low cost--intensive spectrum sharing that both protects U.S. Navy 
systems and ensures that all the spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band is 
available for use. In short, spectrum not actually being used by the 
U.S. Navy or by the post-auction PAL licensee is available to enhance 
the capacity of other operators on an opportunistic, use-it-or-share-it 
basis. One sign of the band's success is that tens of thousands of CBRS 
base stations have been deployed since the band opened up just a few 
months ago, pre-auction and despite the pandemic.
    Another world-leading example of the FCC's innovative leadership in 
spectrum policy is the Commission's unanimous vote in April to 
authorize unlicensed use of unused spectrum capacity across the entire 
6 GHz band--a total of 1,200 megahertz that begins just above the 
portion of the 5 GHz band most used today for Wi-Fi, but which is 
increasingly congested. Chairman Pai and his colleagues deserve 
enormous credit for recognizing that with access to the 6 GHz band, 
next generation Wi-Fi 6 can almost immediately support 5G-quality 
applications and services in any home, business, school or library that 
has access to a high-capacity fixed broadband connection. With access 
to the 6 GHz band, Wi-Fi 6 will accelerate mobile 5G services both by 
providing complementary offload capacity indoors and by facilitating 
early adoption of 5G-quality applications, such as augmented and 
virtual reality.
    Indoor-only use is authorized across all 1,200 megahertz at a low 
power level that the FCC's Office of Engineering and Technology 
determined will not cause harmful interference to band incumbents. This 
decision will both secure U.S. dominance in Wi-Fi and fuel innovation 
in augmented reality and other applications. While Europe is far along 
in authorizing the lower portion of the band for indoor-only use, the 
FCC's experience with spectrum sharing coordinated by geolocation 
databases led it to ``go big'' and authorize standard-power operations 
outdoors in 850 megahertz of the band where incumbent point-to-point 
links can be protected by an Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC) 
system. This will prove hugely beneficial to rural, tribal, small town, 
and other less-densely populated areas that may not see true 5G mobile 
carrier services for many years.
    OTI believes that a general authorization for opportunistic access 
on a use-it-or-share-it basis should be a central piece of any effort 
aimed at expanding spectrum access for small and non-traditional ISPs 
in rural, tribal and other underserved areas, as well as for enterprise 
and institutional use. A version of the CBRS framework should be 
tailored to promote more efficient and intensive use of both Federal 
and commercially licensed bands with substantial unused capacity. 
Opportunistic access policed by an automated AFC database could empower 
a wide variety of small and alternative providers to use fallow 
spectrum in local areas to provide high-speed broadband and other 
services, while retaining the licensee's right to exclusive use of that 
spectrum whenever the carrier commences service. Unleashing 
opportunistic, shared access to fallow spectrum creates a general 
incentive for licensees to build out services more quickly, or to make 
greater efforts to partition or lease their spectrum. This will reduce 
spectrum warehousing and increase access to operators ready to deploy, 
but who lack spectrum access in a local area.
Reforming the Governance of Spectrum
    Not surprisingly, the FCC's efforts to open underutilized bands for 
sharing and to reallocate bands to facilitate emerging services, 
particularly mobile 5G, has met with stiff resistance from incumbent 
users. Whether incumbents are commercial licensees or Federal agencies, 
they inevitably resist on the grounds that authorizing new or more 
efficient use of a band will create an unacceptable risk of harmful 
interference. Because every valuable band of frequencies is occupied by 
some set of incumbents, the FCC now faces the obstacle of rampant 
NIMBYism in virtually every proceeding aimed at opening the spectrum 
capacity needed to facilitate new technologies and services. On the 
commercial side, we see this in the 6 GHz band, where incumbent 
licensees are mounting or threatening litigation. And we see it on the 
Federal side as agencies oppose FCC proposals and even seek to overturn 
or undermine final orders through legislation.
    These spectrum ``turf wars'' and tensions are particularly 
discouraging on the Federal side for two key reasons:

    First, and most importantly, the FCC is the expert agency in the 
best position to evaluate competing technical studies related to the 
risk of truly harmful interference. The FCC has accumulated 
unparalleled engineering expertise in wireless technologies. All 
decisions follow not only public notice and comment, but also a 
separate consultation process with NTIA and any impacted Federal 
agency. It's also crucial that the FCC determine and follow consistent 
definitions and standards concerning what is or isn't an unacceptable 
risk of harmful interference. In my experience, which covers nearly two 
decades of spectrum proceedings, the FCC and its Office of Engineering 
and Technology are objective, thorough and, if anything, decidedly on 
the conservative side when it comes to minimizing the risk of 
interference or disruption to incumbents, particularly Federal users. 
Deference to the FCC as the expert agency should be beyond dispute 
concerning non-federal bands in particular, since Congress gave the FCC 
exclusive jurisdiction over commercial spectrum decisions.
    Second, the number and intensity of recent disputes between Federal 
agencies and the FCC suggest a lack of effective consultation and 
coordination. I'm not in a position to know where the process is 
breaking down, although it seems likely that the combination of a very 
activist FCC and the lack of a coherent Federal spectrum policy 
mediated by White House oversight has proven to be a toxic combination. 
As I explain further below, because the NTIA is primarily an advocate 
for Federal spectrum users, and the FCC is focused primarily on 
promoting private industry and the economy, in our split system of 
spectrum governance it is imperative that White House officials play a 
guiding and mediating role in defining the balance that best serves the 
broader national interest.
    Spectrum ``turf wars'' and conflicts between the FCC and incumbent 
users of spectrum, both private licensees and Federal users, are likely 
to worsen as sharing or consolidating long-occupied bands becomes the 
``new normal.'' On the Federal side, this has created a recognition 
that our split system for spectrum allocation will require reform. Last 
fall NTIA asked the CSMAC, on which I've served since 2009, to study 
whether a new approach or structure for spectrum governance would 
better optimize U.S. spectrum management ``for the implementation of a 
21st century national spectrum strategy.'' After discussions that 
involved most members, the Working Group reported at CSMAC's January 
public meeting that:

        There is general agreement among [CSMAC] members that the 
        United States' current approach for managing the use of 
        spectrum is no longer effectively serving the needs of the 
        entire stakeholder community and would benefit from reform. 
        Moreover, with the increased use of spectrum by all 
        stakeholders, we agree that issues around allocations, 
        spectrum-sharing and band adjacencies will need to be handled 
        with both speed and skill to ensure that the U.S. is making the 
        most of its critical national resources.

    The divided responsibility for spectrum governance might ultimately 
be an issue only this Committee can resolve, since the origins are 
statutory. Long before the FCC's creation, the Radio Act of 1912 
provided that certain frequencies belong exclusively to the government 
as a matter of national security. A decade later, the Inter-
Departmental Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC) was established as a 
coordinating body for Federal departments and agencies with an interest 
in radio communications. The Radio Act of 1927, followed by the 
Communications Act of 1934, formalized the dual structure, giving the 
FCC exclusive authority to license non-governmental spectrum, but 
exempting radio operations owned by the Federal Government.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. Sec. 151. See GAO, 
Information on Management and Use of the Radio Frequency Spectrum--A 
Little-Understood Resource, B-159895 (1974).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    At its April public meeting, the CSMAC Working Group previewed a 
range of options for alternative spectrum governance models. One 
general option is to integrate all authority over spectrum allocation 
into one existing agency or the other, creating a ``new'' FCC or a 
``new'' NTIA. Another general option is to create a new independent 
agency to assume this role, either as a ``full service spectrum 
agency'' that assumes all spectrum-related functions, or possibly as a 
more limited ``spectrum resource agency'' that assumes responsibility 
for all ``top-level spectrum governance and policy decisions'' while 
leaving implementation to the FCC and NTIA. A final category described 
more incremental changes, including, most notably, updating and 
enhancing the current Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between NTIA 
and the FCC, signed in 2003, to expedite and strengthen coordination 
and decision-making.\7\

    \7\ ``Memorandum of Understanding between the Federal 
Communications Commission and the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration.'' Available: https://docs.fcc.gov/public/
attachments/DOC-230835A2.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The CSMAC's work on this topic is ongoing. A more detailed report 
on these alternatives will be discussed at the July 30 public meeting, 
so I will not venture an opinion now. However, I do believe a few 
changes can and should be made that do not require legislation:

    First, the White House needs to drive and finalize a National 
Spectrum Strategy that outlines a coherent set of priorities and 
strategies that can help shape a consensus among the FCC, NTIA, and 
Federal users represented on the IRAC. As President Trump set forth in 
his 2017 Presidential Memorandum, ``the Nation requires a balanced, 
forward-looking, flexible, and sustainable approach to spectrum 
management.'' \8\ Building on the PCAST recommendations, President 
Obama set his administration on a new path that favored unlocking 
exclusive but underutilized Federal bands, such as the 3.5 GHz band 
where CBRS now operates, but the current path and plan are not clearly 
in sight.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sustainable Spectrum Strategy for America's Future,'' 25 October 2018. 
Available: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/
presidential-memorandum-developing-sustainable-spectrum-strategy-
americas-future/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Second, the current MOU that governs coordination on spectrum 
matters between the NTIA and FCC should be updated and enhanced. As the 
CSMAC Working Group reported at its April public meeting, the 15-day 
coordination period for routine items leaves gaps and potential discord 
on non-routine items. The group suggested that for ``non-routine FCC 
items, [the MOU should] create an agreed escalation process and include 
specific time frames for resolution.'' The two agencies should strive 
to agree on a common set of metrics and methodologies to determine when 
a band is underutilized and, critically, to predict potentially harmful 
interference. A joint test bed and annual joint workshop could 
``explore novel spectrum sharing, management techniques, and 
approaches.'' The MOU should also provide for an annual report to 
Congress that describes the agencies' ``joint spectrum planning 
activities, future spectrum requirements, spectrum allocation actions 
necessary to accommodate those uses,'' including any significant areas 
of disagreement.
    Third, the coordination and consultation process itself needs to be 
more transparent to stakeholders. It is typically not clear outside the 
FCC and NTIA to what degree there are concerns about a proposed policy 
or what technical information is being exchanged. As part of this, the 
MOU should require that Federal agencies--or NTIA on their behalf--
monitor and file comments and technical studies in the FCC's notice and 
comment docket in a timely manner (in redacted form, if necessary). Too 
often Federal agency concerns come to light at the 11th hour, after the 
FCC and the private sector have finished building a public record. 
While these early filings should not replace the requirement for 
consultation with NTIA after the FCC evaluates the record and reaches a 
tentative conclusion, it does ensure that agencies, industry and other 
stakeholders are not blindsided by last-minute objections never fully 
or publicly documented.
    Fourth, and most importantly, the Executive Office of the President 
needs to engage directly in guiding and mediating disputes that arise 
when the FCC and NTIA cannot reach a consensus. As noted above, while 
both the FCC and NTIA are to a significant degree `captured' by their 
role as advocates for the private sector and Federal spectrum users, 
respectively, the right combination of officials in the White House 
should be in the best position to discern the overall national 
interest. The ``Spectrum Management Team'' recommended in the PCAST 
Report is an example.\9\ Only the EOP has the clout to enforce a 
government-wide strategic direction and to push back against individual 
departments or agencies that diverge. A deeper engagement in spectrum 
policy by at least OSTP and NEC can also assist the FCC at critical 
times when it faces opposition to proposals for spectrum sharing (e.g., 
6 GHz) or consolidation and clearing (e.g., C-band) from powerful 
incumbent licensees in commercial bands.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ The PCAST Report made a specific recommendation along these 
lines. See PCAST Report at ix (``Specifically, we recommend that the 
White House Chief Technology Officer (CTO), with equivalent level 
representatives from the National Security Staff (NSS), the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB), and National Economic Council (NEC) 
formalize a Spectrum Management Team (SMT) to work with the NTIA to 
carry out the President's directive.'').

Next Generation Wi-Fi: Accelerating Affordable 5G Services for All 
        Americans
    The 5.9 and 6 GHz proceedings pending at the FCC exemplify both the 
promise and peril of the current imperative to share or reallocate 
spectrum to advance America's 5G future. Unlicensed spectrum is what 
ultimately makes both mobile and fixed broadband service more 
available, fast and affordable to consumers and businesses nationwide. 
Far more unlicensed spectrum is needed to distribute a gigabit or more 
of bandwidth to all the users and devices in our Nation's homes, 
offices, schools and other venues. But because every band of very 
useful spectrum is occupied by one or more incumbent uses, adding even 
a very low power ``underlay'' of unlicensed use on vacant portions of 
underutilized bands--such as the 6 GHz band--entails overcoming the 
inevitable opposition of incumbent users and their NIMBY claims of 
imminent disruption. Our public interest coalition believes that 
Chairman Pai and his colleagues displayed both remarkable vision and 
care in crafting balanced and innovative proposals for 5.9 and 6 GHz 
that will ultimately fuel not only the world's most robust 5G wireless 
ecosystem, but one that is more available and affordable in rural, 
small town and low-income areas across the entire nation.
    Wi-Fi is the workhorse of the Internet because low-cost, off-the-
shelf routers and devices easily and affordably offer access to 
unlicensed spectrum that provides high-capacity connectivity in homes, 
at work, at school, in libraries, restaurants, retailers, and virtually 
every public place. The vast majority of data consumed on smartphones 
and other mobile devices flows over Wi-Fi networks, never touching 
mobile carrier spectrum or infrastructure. The share of data traffic 
offloaded via Wi-Fi is expected to increase sharply as mobile 
technology upgrades from 4G to 5G, since high-bandwidth applications 
are typically used at home, work and other indoor locations. Cisco 
projects that 76 percent of all data traffic on smartphone and other 
mobile devices will be offloaded onto Wi-Fi in North America by 
2022.\10\ The U.S. alone will have an estimated 77 million Wi-Fi 
hotspots by then.\11\ Providers acknowledge Wi-Fi's central role. For 
example, Verizon's Executive VP and Consumer Group CEO told an investor 
conference in January that between 70 percent and 75 percent of mobile 
device data traffic is offloaded onto Wi-Fi.\12\

6 GHz Band: Unlicensed Sharing Across 1200 MHz Will Benefit All 
        Americans
    Unlicensed Access 1200 contiguous megahertz at 6 GHz--from 5925 to 
7125 MHz--is the fuel necessary to power gigabit-fast and affordable 
Wi-Fi 6 and other unlicensed innovations of greatest benefit to 
consumers and the overall economy. Consumer and digital inclusion 
advocates strongly supported the FCC's decision to authorize low-power 
and indoor-only use of unlicensed devices across all four band segments 
(a total of 1200 megahertz). We likewise supported the FCC's proposal 
to allow outdoor unlicensed operations at a higher (``standard'') power 
in two band segments that total 850 megahertz subject to registration 
and recurring authorization by an Automated Frequency Coordination 
(AFC) system.
    While consumer and digital inclusion advocates celebrated he FCC's 
April Order, the still-pending Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
addresses two critical shortcomings that threaten to diminish the value 
of Wi-Fi 6 for the vast majority of Americans at home and at work.
    First, the enormous consumer benefits of authorizing low-power, 
indoor-only (``LPI'') devices across the entire 6 GHz band will be 
undermined if the power levels are restricted to a level below what's 
needed to protect high-power fixed links outdoors. The maximum power 
adopted in April (5 dBm/MHz power spectral density) might be justified 
as a ``compromise'' with powerful incumbents, but in practice it makes 
Wi-Fi routers far more costly, complex, and less useful for the average 
household or small business. In the context of the current pandemic, 
because Wi-Fi 6 routers and devices can come to market as soon as the 
end of this year, OTI believes it is critical that consumers and 
businesses have the indoor coverage they need to function reliably and 
affordably. The Commission should not pull the technical rug out from 
under ordinary consumers, schools, and small businesses unless the 
engineering evidence in the record clearly establishes that LPI at up 
to 8 dBm/MHz PSD will measurably and substantially increase the risk of 
harmful interference to incumbent users. As the Commission acknowledged 
in its April Order, reliable engineering studies in the record show 
that this modest power increase is extremely unlikely to cause actual 
harmful interference to any band incumbents.
    Second, to its credit the FCC recognizes in the FNPRM that Wi-Fi 6 
and other unlicensed technologies will not deliver the potential 
benefits of new applications, such as augmented and virtual reality, 
without authorizing an additional class of Very Low Power (VLP) 
devices. OTI and PISC strongly support the Commission's proposal to 
authorize VLP devices to operate both indoors and outdoors across the 
band's entire 1200 megahertz unburdened by any requirement to be under 
the control of an Automated Frequency Control (``AFC'') system. It is 
crucial that the Commission authorize VLP devices to operate at power 
levels up to 14 dBm EIRP, which is the minimum power level needed to 
achieve the enormous potential consumer and economic benefits of VLP, 
while also fully protecting band incumbents from harmful interference.
The Vacant 5.9 GHz Band is a Roadblock to a Potential Wi-Fi 
        Superhighway
    OTI strongly supports the Commission's pending proposal to 
reallocate at least 45 megahertz of the virtually unused 5.9 GHz band 
for unlicensed use. The 5.9 GHz band lies directly between the upper 
portion of the 5 GHz band, currently the most heavily-used Wi-Fi 
spectrum, and the 6 GHz band that will soon become the go-to band for 
next generation Wi-Fi 6. As Commissioner Mike O'Rielly so aptly put it, 
the 5.9 GHz band is ``the missing link between the 5 GHz and 6 GHz 
bands.'' Reallocating the 5.9 GHz band for unlicensed use would create 
an immensely productive Wi-Fi Superhighway, enabling contiguous 
channels of multi-gigabit-fast connectivity in every home and business. 
Contiguous wide channels of unlicensed spectrum with mid-band 
propagation is essential for accelerating the next-generation of 5G-
capable Wi-Fi services nationwide, including for fixed wireless 
broadband in rural areas.
    Back in 1999, the FCC allocated this 75 megahertz (5850 to 5925 
MHz) for auto safety signaling using a specific technology called 
Dedicated Short-Range Communications (``DSRC''). For two decades the 
band has gone almost completely unused, making the 5.9 GHz band a 
telling experiment in market forces and innovation. Wi-Fi also emerged 
in 1999. Over that time, unlicensed innovation and Wi-Fi use has 
surged, saturating both the 2.4 GHz band and two segments of the 5 GHz 
band with intensive spectrum re-use that generates hundreds of billions 
of dollars annually in consumer surplus.\13\ The `car band,' meanwhile, 
sits idling and empty. The band is so empty that the FCC recently 
authorized more than 100 rural wireless Internet providers (WISPs) to 
use it to enhance the capacity of fixed wireless networks in rural 
areas.

29.html.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Currently the auto and mobile industries are developing Cellular 
V2X as an alternative to DSRC. Since C-V2X is in its infancy and is 
likely to thrive, if at all, as an application on general purpose 
mobile 5G networks, OTI believes it would be a ``win-win'' for 
consumers to relocate V2X safety signaling. We believe Congress should 
urge the FCC and DOT to work together to explore all alternatives, 
including whether an alternative band, such as the nearly vacant 4.9 
GHz public safety band, could be equally or more useful for vehicle 
safety applications that are integrated with 5G mobile networks. We 
recently released a paper making the case for relocating at least the 
future Cellular V2X safety applications to 4.9 GHz, or to another 
dedicated band that is not wedged between what will be the two most 
intensively used Wi-Fi bands.\14\ The Dynamic Spectrum Alliance, a 
high-tech industry coalition, recently made a similar proposal.\15\ 
Consumers will benefit most if the allocations for both auto safety and 
next generation Wi-Fi are optimized.

The Lower 3 GHz band: Expedite Shared Access to Unused Military Radar 
        Spectrum
    As requested by Congress, earlier this month NTIA released a report 
on the military radar bands at 3100-3550 MHz that ``focuses on creating 
opportunities for commercial use by sharing rather than by clearing the 
spectrum'' and ``under the assumption of no changes in incumbent 
operations.'' The report concludes that ``the 3450-3550 MHz portion of 
this band is a good candidate for potential spectrum sharing'' and that 
``ultimately some sharing of spectrum below 3450 MHz may be possible as 
well.'' \16\

Wireless Services Sharing with Federal Operations in the 3100-3550 MHz 
Band, at 1 (July 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    OTI encourages this Committee to examine whether the 3 GHz spectrum 
immediately below the CBRS band--and currently used extensively for 
Department of Defense radar systems--could, like the 3550-3650 MHz 
band, be opened for dynamic sharing under the control of a Spectrum 
Access System (SAS) and as an expansion of CBRS. Like the grossly 
underutilized 3.5 GHz band, there is every indication that the 3300-
3550 MHz band can be successfully shared with military radar systems 
that currently occupy the band.
    The NTIA's separate technical report on the 3450-3550 MHz sub-band 
found that a dynamic, time-based sharing mechanism ``present[s] a 
potentially attractive approach to both protecting Federal systems and 
providing viable commercial operations.'' \17\ Such a dynamic sharing 
arrangement could be enabled by having Federal incumbents dynamically 
inform a SAS when and where they are operating rather than having 
Spectrum Access Systems rely on spectrum sensing systems, which can be 
problematic for a number of reasons. Conversely, NTIA's technical 
report concluded that the static geographic- and/or frequency-based 
approaches more conducive to exclusive, very wide-area licensing is 
problematic. Such a static sharing approach would ``result in 
significant restrictions on commercial services, in terms of emitter 
power limits and exclusion zones, making sufficient access for viable 
commercial applications unlikely.'' \18\

    The 2012 PCAST report concluded that often the ``clearing and 
reallocation of Federal spectrum is not a sustainable basis for 
spectrum policy due to the high cost, lengthy time to implement, and 
disruption to the Federal mission.'' DoD's Defense Innovation Board 
(DIB) report last year similarly concluded that within a reasonable 
time frame, dynamic sharing would be far more feasible and acceptable 
from the military's perspective.\19\ OTI fully agrees with the DIB. The 
report's co-authors wrote separately that clearing DoD spectrum for 
exclusive-use licensing is ``impractical'' given the need to find and 
clear substitute bands for military radar.\20\ Even if possible, the 
delay would be self-defeating if the goal is to win a global race to 
5G. OTI agrees that shared access can open the 3450-3550 MHz band for 
5G-quality networks years sooner by leveraging the coordination 
capabilities of FCC-certified SAS databases.

The 12 GHz Band can Provide Shared Spectrum for 5G and Rural Broadband
    The 12 GHz Band provides an opportunity to adopt a sharing 
framework that greatly expands the availability of spectrum for both 
fixed and mobile broadband deployments with mid-band propagation 
characteristics significantly better than the millimeter wave bands at 
24 GHz and beyond. By adding the 12 GHz Band to the Commission's 5G 
FAST Plan, the FCC can make an additional 500 megahertz of contiguous 
spectrum available for two-way fixed and mobile 5G wireless broadband 
services, while protecting incumbent satellite uses (including 
satellite broadband) from harmful interference. This will promote 
competition, innovation and improve services to underserved 
communities.
    OTI, as well as the Competitive Carriers Association, INCOMPAS and 
other parties have urged the FCC to launch a NPRM to consider the 
petition filed four years ago by DISH and other terrestrial licensees 
in the 12 GHz band who are currently restricted to one-way and very 
low-power transmissions under outdated rules. Although OTI and most 
consumer advocates opposed the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, now that 
there are only three national mobile broadband providers it is 
imperative that the FCC ensure that DISH has access to sufficient 
spectrum to compete aggressively with the incumbent providers. In doing 
so, we also have urged the FCC to protect the operations of Space-X and 
other potential satellite broadband competitors that have co-primary 
rights in the 12 GHz band.
    In addition, OTI, Public Knowledge and other public interest groups 
have urged the FCC to seek comment on the authorization of coordinated, 
shared use of the band for high-capacity fixed wireless services on an 
opportunistic unlicensed or licensed-by-rule basis. Authorizing 
coordinated access to vacant 12 GHz spectrum on a secondary basis would 
be particularly beneficial for rural, tribal and other underserved 
communities.
    If the FCC grants terrestrial MVDDS licensees more flexible use 
rights, the shared nature of the band makes it likely that power limits 
will be lower than in bands that mobile operators will rely upon for 
wide-area 5G coverage. As a result, mobile 5G deployments are likely to 
be limited for years to urban, inner-suburban and other higher-traffic 
areas where an investment in greater capacity justifies the cost. 
Rather than leave as much as 500 megahertz in the band fallow in 
underserved rural and other less-densely-populated areas, the 
Commission--and this Subcommittee--should consider a ``use it or share 
it'' approach that allows at least secondary, coordinated access for 
fixed broadband uses.
Unused C-band Spectrum Can Spur Rural Wireless Broadband
    OTI and multiple public interest, high-tech and rural broadband 
provider coalitions supported two proposals that would put all 500 
megahertz of today's grossly underutilized C-band to work to fuel 
America's 5G future and to close the rural broadband divide. First, we 
strongly supported the FCC's pivot late last year to a public auction 
for 280 megahertz in the lower portion of C-band. Although OTI and our 
broader Public Interest Spectrum Coalition continue to oppose the $9.7 
billion giveaway to foreign satellite companies adopted by the FCC as 
unlawful and unnecessary, we do believe that consolidating fixed 
satellite services and reallocating 280 megahertz for public auction 
will hasten a more widespread deployment of mobile 5G services.
    In addition, those same rural broadband, high-tech and public 
interest coalitions supported a proposal to authorize coordinated, 
shared access to unused spectrum across the entire C-band to the extent 
it would not cause harmful interference to registered earth stations or 
to future licensed mobile services. A study by wireless engineers at 
Virginia Tech showed that even after incumbent earth stations are 
consolidated into the upper 200 megahertz of the band, every megahertz 
could be used in roughly 80 percent of the U.S. to provide gigabit-fast 
fixed wireless broadband service to more than 80 million Americans, 
mostly in rural and underserved areas.\21\ By requiring rural ISPs and 
other operators to rely on an automated coordination system, the FCC 
can fully protect earth stations (and thereby TV and radio consumers) 
in the same way that FCC-certified Spectrum Access Systems are now 
protecting the U.S. Navy and satellite earth stations in the 
immediately adjacent 3550-3700 MHz band.

Sharing in C-band,'' Fierce Wireless (July 2, 2019). Available: https:/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unfortunately, although the FCC included this proposal in its 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, it did not adopt it. We believe that any 
Congressional action on C-band should require the FCC to authorize 
coordinated, shared access to unused spectrum across the entire band to 
the extent it does not cause harmful interference to registered earth 
stations or to future licensed mobile services. Spectrum itself is 
public infrastructure that can be used to help close the digital 
divide. OTI strongly supports the SMART Act, which would minimize the 
unnecessary pay-off to band incumbents and designate a substantial 
share of auction proceeds for a Digital Divide Trust Fund. We urge the 
leadership of this Committee to prioritize a compromise that both 
earmarks proceeds to promote broadband access in rural, tribal, low-
income and other underserved areas and also requires the FCC to 
authorize coordinated, shared access to unused spectrum across the 
entire 500 megahertz conditioned on protecting the primary licensees 
from harmful interference.
    Thank you for this opportunity to share our views with the 
Committee on these critical spectrum management issues and proceedings.

    Senator Thune. Thank you, Mr. Calabrese. We will jump right 
into questions and I would like to start by getting to the 
subject of interagency spectrum process. Despite Congress 
delegating authority over Federal spectrum management to NTIA, 
there have been cases where other Federal agencies have 
questioned NTIA's decisions and authority.
    Along those same lines, NTIA is supposed to speak for the 
entire Executive Branch on Federal spectrum issues yet there 
have been multiple examples of Federal agencies communicating 
directly with the FCC rather than collectively through NTIA. 
And I will just open this up to anybody who wants to comment, 
do you all believe that the interagency spectrum process as 
designed by Congress is working effectively as it was intended?
    Mr. Power. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think the structure 
is right. We have had some stumbles the last couple of years as 
you referenced. I think what is needed is just greater 
collaboration between NTIA and FCC at all levels. And 
certainly, we have seen some turnover at the top of NTIA which 
probably hasn't helped. There are a lot of good people at NTIA 
and they are doing a good job, but I think in terms of 
consistent representation of the agencies and consistent 
collaboration with the FCC, some stability there would be of 
assistance.
    But more importantly I think it is just a commitment to 
getting, the smart folks in the room, getting all the engineers 
in the room to tackle these issues and to have a shared vision 
of what we are really trying to achieve as between NTIA and the 
FCC, OMB usually has a view on this stuff, help from OSTP or 
NEC in the White House, and just a continued, sustained, and 
collaborative effort to get to our common goals.
    Senator Thune. Yes. Mr. Gibson.
    Mr. Gibson. Thank you, Chairman Thune, for the question. It 
is an interesting question. You basically quoted from a from a 
memo from the Chairman Pallone of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee on the House side to the GAO to conduct an 
investigation of some of these concerns and issues. And at the 
end, the Committee asked GAO to look into several things. So I 
don't think we feel that the problem process is broken. It may 
be suffering from growing pains.
    The process, as Dr. Layton said, is between 94 and 86 years 
old depending upon when you think it started. If you take the 
Communications Act of 1934, it is 86 years old and a lot has 
happened since then. Quite a bit has happened since then. And 
so the phase we are in now, the age where now is an age where 
there is a lot more shared-use. And so we wonder whether the 
process might lend itself to revisiting that in the context of 
more shared spectrum use.
    Senator Thune. Dr. Layton.
    Ms. Layton. Well, again, thank you for the question and of 
course this hearing, Senator Thune, and your leadership to look 
at this issue. What was created with the 1927 Radio Act, that 
is what we have today and it is acting as what was intended at 
the time which was to make spectrum as a political decision. So 
I think we get what was put in place then and if you also read 
the minutes of IRAC over the years, there have always been 
disputes.
    We forget about them now, but they have always been going 
on amongst the agencies, between the FCC, with the other 
Federal departments. It is nothing new. What I would encourage 
and I encourage this committee, I think there could be more 
Congressional oversight of this particular function. This 
committee does a lot of work to oversee the FCC. I think it 
could do more work to oversee NTIA and IRAC, and I encourage 
you to look at that.
    Senator Thune. OK. Mr. Calabrese, anything to add before we 
move on? OK, I will direct this question to Dr. Layton. In your 
testimony you state that, and I quote, ``5G is the quickest way 
to equalize the digital divide between urban and rural 
America.'' How can we improve the Federal spectrum allocation 
process to provide more equitable benefits to Americans and 
should the process be more transparent?
    Ms. Layton. So what I think you can see, if you look at the 
FCC's spectrum, the ULS, the Universal Licensing System, is 
that what a market-based system does is it allows more 
participation in the spectrum: this number of licenses, the 
number of users, the number of uses. It is tremendous. With 
regard to 5G, because the overall decision around which bands 
are to be used is still an administrative decision, the 
industries, who are going to be disrupted by 5G, want to hijack 
the political process to slow the rollout of 5G.
    I find it very unfortunate. People suffer today because 5G 
has been delayed by at least 2 years. We can look at what's 
going on with C-band for example. Nevertheless, I think 
Chairman Pai, the FCC Commissioner O'Reilly, Commissioner Carr, 
they have been very forthright to continue to push for 5G of 
course and with the help of this committee. It is extremely 
important. All of America wants to have the next generation 
networks. They all need it today, school children, health, 
telemedicine. We know that through the pandemic.
    For a longer term, I hope that we would look at bringing 
pricing to this picture. That is something that is missing. I 
know it is not something in this particular term, but a medium 
to long-term plan should include pricing for Federal spectrum. 
That would reduce the squabbling significantly.
    Senator Thune. I am going to run and vote and return. 
Senator Schatz I think is available. Senator Wicker is up. The 
Chairman--we will yield to the Chairman of the Full Committee 
for questions.
    The Chairman. I think we had told Senator Schatz he could 
be next so if he is available----
    Senator Schatz. I am available but I defer to you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    The Chairman. Well, then if I might, let me ask, and start 
with Mr. Power, about mid-band spectrum. As I understand it, if 
you could--and bear in mind we have a variety of knowledge 
levels among the viewers today and it is surprising how many 
people listen to our hearings--give us if you can a little bit 
of a primer on the advantages of mid band versus high band 
spectrum and also versus low band spectrum. And then, am I 
correct in my data that we really rank fifth in the world in 
mid band spectrum allocation?
    Mr. Power. Thank you, Chairman Wicker. So when we think 
about spectrum, we do divide it into these three categories: 
low-band, mid-band, high-band. Low band is what 4G was built on 
very successfully. It has the advantage of great coverage over 
miles. It is not as great at the amount of capacity, the amount 
of data you can carry. High band spectrum is just the opposite. 
It contains a lot of capacity, very low latency, but the 
distance it travels isn't as great.
    Mid band is as my friend, Dr. Layton, said in her 
testimony, is the goldilocks because it combines elements of 
both. You get good capacity, but you get good coverage too. And 
that is why it is so important. And to your point, we are 
behind there. We have zero spectrum in the critical mid band 
spectrum license today. The CBRS license or auction that is 
commencing today will give us 70 megahertz of that and start to 
catch up but other countries are multiples ahead of that.
    The Chairman. Why are we so far behind?
    Mr. Power. Well, I think Chairman Pai deserves credit. In 
his 5G fast plan, he identified low, mid, and high. I think the 
high band was kind of the most accessible in the fastest amount 
of time. The mid band spectrum, as we talked about, has been 
encumbered by other uses. And so we are doing the best we can 
on that. But I think that is why the high band came first and 
the high band has great benefits for us too.
    The Chairman. Dr. Layton or Mr. Gibson, you want to weigh 
in?
    Ms. Layton. OK. So what I would say, if you look at other 
countries that they don't have the military in this band or 
there is a lot less military. So we have the military taking 
precedence. That is one part of it. And you know, when we 
allocated these things however many decades ago, no one 
realized that there would be such a thing as 5G. So that is 
part of the importance of having market-based mechanisms 
because we can trade up all the time.
    The Chairman. What are we not anticipating today in 2020?
    Ms. Layton. Well, I would say our biggest blind spot is 
China and that is and you know this. You are deep into the 
security world and those challenges. To me it is not just the 
issue of the spectrum deployment, it is the whole ecosystem. 
Whereas China, in their command-and-control spectrum policy, 
they align all the national champions. They get the right 
spectrum, the national champions, and then they want to have 
all those things together. Now, they don't have the market-
based system the way we do, but they are organizing themselves 
in that way to be able to roll out to the rest of the world.
    Now, I want to compliment my friend Mr. Power who has 
talked about, we don't have to be China to beat China. What I 
think where we have held ourselves back is we have not let the 
market play the role that it should because it would quickly 
resolve these discrepancies and the best would come forward. So 
in the medium term, we are satisfying--we are doing it in a 
suboptimal way, but we would move much faster and more quickly 
if we would allow the market to work.
    The Chairman. Mr. Gibson.
    Mr. Gibson. Chairman Wicker, that is a wonderful question. 
I would add one thing that my panelist may not have added is 
that we are probably leaders in the world in sharing spectrum. 
And so while I am not exactly sure of the motivations behind 
being fifth. You know, it is certainly a place you don't want 
to be but I think we have been leaders in sharing. As you heard 
in Mr. Calabrese's testimony about Citizens Broadband Radio 
Service and the applications of the brand new spectrum access 
systems. And in the 6 gigahertz band, we are embarking upon a 
sharing regime where we are going to be using something 
similar. So I think we have led the world in the ability to 
find ways to share spectrum without having to disrupt 
incumbents by relocating them.
    Sharing spectrum is something that starts off difficult but 
ends up working overtime and you can see for example in the 
Citizens Broadband Radio Service the way we have been able to 
find ways to share with the existing incumbents, primarily the 
radar systems, is by deploying sensor networks. So that is a 
facile--well I wouldn't say it facile, but it is a way that we 
have established to share spectrum with systems that are radar 
systems that are very difficult to share with.
    So, I think we've been able to apply United States, 
American ingenuity and technology to find ways to put spectrum 
to probably more efficient use and sharing. And so we think 
that is probably something to think about going forward.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much. Senator Schatz.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a question 
for Mr. Calabrese and Mr. Powers about 5G. And you know, 
working with Senator Thune, Senator Wicker, Senator Cantwell, 
we are all trying to make sure that the United States is as 
successful as possible with 5G, but I just want to have a 
little bit of straight talk here. If there is not a business 
case for broadband connectivity in rural areas right now 
without subsidy, in what world do we think 5G pencils out in 
rural areas without subsidy? Mr. Calabrese.
    Mr. Calabrese. Yes, Senator. That is absolutely right. It 
is an important concern that actually we have a, you know, as 
we are seeing in that context of the pandemic, we have a 
horrible digital divide currently in a 4G world and there is 
the risk that as we go to 5G, that that divide just gets even 
wider. That it leaves some people in less densely populated 
areas and low income neighborhoods even further behind.
    There is no question, I mean that, you know, Wall Street 
analysts, the recent GAO report that while indicated that the 
5G has its promised right with gigabit throughput, a very low 
latency, connecting hundreds of devices--we don't have that yet 
but when we do, it is so expensive to deploy that it will only 
be deployed in the initial years in urban areas, maybe inner 
suburban, other high traffic venues, but it won't be out there 
in small towns and rural areas at all. And that is where Wi-Fi, 
the next generation of Wi-Fi is so critical because thanks to 
the FCC's recent order allowing shared access to the 6 
gigahertz band, this new generation of Wi-Fi can deliver the 
same services.
    The same--in fact, it can accelerate American leadership in 
5G applications and services, gigabit fast, low latency, 
coordinating many devices, higher quality, but to every home, 
business, school, library that has a fast, fixed broadband 
connection. It just puts it over the air. It gets that gigabit 
distributed to every user in range.
    Senator Schatz. Mr. Power.
    Mr. Power. Thank you. Senator. Without a doubt we need to 
see the benefits of 5G pushed out throughout the country. We 
are glad to see that 5G, as it currently exists, covers about 
two-thirds of the population today. Going forward, we do face 
the challenge of communities that are just not economically 
viable to serve. There is no disputing that. We are glad to see 
Chairman Pai moving ahead with his 5G fund which would allocate 
about $9 billion to help meet that challenge but we will look 
to that kind of support, I think, to make this work, and 
especially in the short term, as we have seen since COVID, 
there are so many Americans now who do need a safety net just 
in the short term and then in the long term as well.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you, and I will stay with you, Mr. 
Power. Let's talk a little bit about broadband mapping. How can 
the FCC and NTIA coordinate their broadband mapping efforts so 
that the funding is better targeted to people who remain 
unconnected. How do we get these maps to not just be more 
accurate but to inform some pretty expensive decisions that are 
pending?
    Mr. Power. Well, this has, obviously as you know Senator, 
been the challenge as of late. Congress acted with the help of 
this committee with the Broadband Data Act which the FCC has 
now implemented to set the parameters that will guide how these 
maps are collected.
    It is a challenge, particular in the wireless side, given 
the physics of wireless technology with the signal when you get 
to the edge of the cell, but we are committed to working with 
this committee, with the FCC to make those maps as accurate as 
possible to make sure that the money that we are subsidizing is 
targeted to the communities most in need.
    Senator Schatz. OK, thank you very much. Mr. Calabrese, my 
final question. I think you will agree that the FCC is 
currently using flawed or incomplete maps and they are about to 
award $16 billion, about 80 percent of the funds available 
through the rural digital opportunity fund for build-out in 
unserved areas, and I am trying to wrap my mind around why we 
would deploy almost all of the money in this fund before we 
actually know exactly where it is best spent and I am wondering 
if you can comment on that.
    Mr. Calabrese. Yes, Senator. I totally agree. I believe 
Commissioner Rosenworcel put it best when she is in her dissent 
to the RDOF order. You know, which said--she said we need 
mapping before money and data before deployment. And that is 
right. This is most--the lion share of the universal service 
funding is being committed for a 10-year period when for 
example U.S. Telecom and others in a mapping pilot found that 
38 percent of homes in rural--homes and businesses in rural 
areas that the FCC had as covered in fact did not have 
broadband connectivity. And then in addition we are locked----
    Senator Schatz. Could you say that one more time for the 
listening public? I think it is a really important fact.
    Mr. Calabrese. Right. Well that--just as one indicator of 
how flawed the mapping data is we have now U.S. Telecom and its 
partners in a pilot mapping pilot found that 38 percent of the 
homes and businesses that the FCC had as covered in rural areas 
in fact, you know, did not have broadband service. And so we 
are now in the process of blocking all those homes and 
businesses out of the Federal subsidy program for the next 10 
years by dispensing all this money in a rush and doing it at 
speeds that are substandard, 25, 3 megabits per second up and 
down. That is just woefully inadequate for the future. And then 
it allows data caps. There is all kinds of problems with the 
RDOF program.
    Senator Schatz. Yes. You know, my time is up, but I will 
just make one final comment on this. I know we have bipartisan 
agreement about the flawed nature of the maps, but the FCC 
itself has become so polarized and partisanized under this 
Chairman that it is very difficult for Members on the other 
side of the aisle to be overtly critical of the actions of this 
Commission because it is seen as somehow a proxy for being 
critical of the President of the United States.
    But the fact of the matter is these maps are garbage and we 
are about to deploy money, and as you said, lock almost 40 
percent of rural Americans out of having any access to subsidy 
which means for the next decade they are not going to get 
broadband that they are entitled to because the Commissioner 
wants to push it out and the Congress is unwilling to put the 
pressure on the Commission to do the right thing. Thank you 
very much.
    The Chairman. Senator Tester. We understand there are some 
technical difficulties. Can you hear us and are you ready to 
go?

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Senator Tester. I can hear you and I appreciate that, Mr. 
Chairman. If I am allowed to go next, I would love to do that.
    The Chairman. You are next and you are recognized, sir.
    Senator Tester. You are a gentleman and a scholar and I do 
not have a good clock in front of you so you could just gavel 
me down when time, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. You are looking a little pale today, John.
    Senator Tester. Yes, well a little fuzzy you might say. So, 
Mr. Calabrese, I want to continue on with you if I might and 
that is that in my neck of the woods, which is pretty damn 
rural, spectrum issues don't mean a whole lot to folks. What 
really means a lot to folks is when they pick up their cell 
phone and it either works or it doesn't work.
    And I will tell you that where I am at, I will probably be 
liberal by saying 50 percent of the time the cell phone works, 
50 percent of the time it doesn't. And it changes depending on 
how you hold your mouth or what direction--so what policy 
changes, what spectrum policy changes can we do, if any, to 
help close the digital divide to bring wireless coverage into 
rural areas? And this is for you, Mike.
    Mr. Calabrese. OK. Right. So one of course is you know, I 
have mentioned a big increase in unlicensed spectrum. And you 
know what we all think about and what I emphasized was, you 
know, indoor use for these new bandwidth hungry apps, you know, 
distributing that gigabit around the school or the home. But it 
is also very important in rural areas. All the, you know, more 
than 1,500 small wireless ISPs, almost all in rural areas, rely 
on unlicensed spectrum for high capacity fixed wireless, point-
to-multipoint. It is about one-fifth to one-tenth the cost of 
springing fiber and so we can get broadband connectivity out in 
these rural areas much more quickly, but they rely on 
unlicensed spectrum. They need more capacity.
    So this is--the 6 gigahertz is going to make a huge 
difference there. Second, there is lots of other underutilized 
spectrum that is not being used in particularly rural areas. So 
a whole big coalition of us, rural providers, high-tech 
consumer groups proposed that the Commission in the C-band 
allow use of a coordinated sharing of the vacant C-band 
spectrum in rural areas, again, for this high-capacity fixed 
wireless.
    And the Commission put it in its proposed rulemaking but 
did not act on it. And there are other bands, the 12 gigahertz 
band is another one where if the FCC moves forward with an 
NPRM, it can include a provision for coordinated sharing. And 
finally, I mentioned the Senators Schatz and Kennedy and 
others, the smart app and Chairman Thune has his own version of 
this, that would require auction, you know, take a share of the 
auction revenue and put it in a digital divide trust fund so 
that it could be--so that we could have more funding available 
to close the gap in these areas.
    So--excuse me about the buzzer. So let's carry on then. 
What percentage of the spectrum from the auction proceeds 
should we devote to rural communication build out?
    Mr. Calabrese. Right, so, you know, with all respect to 
Chairman Thune I would say significantly more than 10 percent. 
Chairman Thune was on the right track, I believe, in making it 
about broader than just the C-band option. He said, you know, 
the proceeds from auctions over the next two years until the 
end of the FCC's auction authority period. So I think Congress 
should be looking at extending the auction authority and taking 
a share much larger than 10 percent of all auction revenue.
    You know, that is how we--that is how we ceded First Net 
for example, auction revenue the incentive auction and 
elsewhere. So yes, I think definitely what we need to do is the 
monies being paid in these auctions to cover the more 
profitable, big urban and suburban areas, we need to recycle 
that money in the industry to cover the low income and 
particularly rural areas.
    Senator Tester. Do you have any sort of figure in that 
you'd be comfortable in pulling out as far as what should be 
dedicated to--and by the way, I don't think Chairman Thune 
would feel upset with that. He lives in a rural State. I think 
that he is the kind of guy that would love to see more money go 
into rural America.
    Mr. Calabrese. Yes, I would hope so. Well, you know, I 
certainly think at least 50 percent but you know really it is--
you know, we see in the current crisis it is such a pressing 
problem. I mean broadband is a new electricity. And so whatever 
we need. Whatever it takes.
    Senator Tester. OK. Appreciate that perspective, Michael. 
Tom Power, I want to ask you the same question. What, do you 
think, what percentage of spectrum auction funds should be we 
devote for rural communications roll out? Mr. Tom Power.
    Mr. Power. Thank, Senator. I don't have a number at hand. 
You know, we certainly defer to you and the members of the 
Committee in Congress to figure out the best use of these 
proceeds. It is, as I said, essential if we are going to get 
out to these economically unviable areas. The industry, you 
know, invests $25 billion a year as it is, but as you have 
experienced and as we all have when we are out in rural areas, 
we need some help from the subsidy system.
    And I will say having addressed this 10, 11 years ago when 
I was at NTIA under the Recovery Act, we found that there 
were--one of the secrets to success was the local organizations 
coming together to, you know, the bank, the school, the Mayor, 
and looking for the resources and then collaborating with the 
Government here in Washington to make it happen. And that is 
what--we just need to double down on those efforts.
    Senator Tester. Well, I appreciate both of your comments on 
this. I can tell you that I live in an area where there isn't a 
lot of people and I can tell you the number of times I wanted 
to throw this thing through the wall is far more than I got 
fingers and I got less fingers than Wicker--and that is still a 
lot. It is because it is incredibly frustrating to try to do 
business when you are in the middle of town telling somebody 
what kind of part you need for your combine and the damn phone 
quits working.
    And it happens more often than it doesn't. And so I really 
appreciate you guys' input and I really think that the revenue 
and doing our best to be able to try to meet the needs, as you 
guys presented them. So I always want to thank you very, very 
much. Thank you, Chairman Wicker.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Tester.
    Senator Tester. Chairman Thune, I stand corrected.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Thune. Sorry.
    Senator Tester. Sorry about that. That was----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Thune. No, but yes, I can hear your frustration and 
I am glad you are spending time on a combine. It actually 
probably feels like you are accomplishing something when you 
are sitting on a combine.
    Senator Tester. That is true.
    Senator Thune. Next up is Senator Blumenthal.

             STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT

    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you very, very much, Mr. 
Chairman, and I want to talk a little bit about Lifeline, about 
connectivity which for America should be a matter of bipartisan 
essential work. As you well know after Hurricane Katrina, the 
FCC took sweeping action to make sure that anybody affected by 
that disaster was connected. Within 1 month the FCC dedicated 
more than $200 million to fund connectivity efforts and very 
aggressively opened up Lifeline and E-Rate programs to new 
carriers and subscribers.
    What I have been hearing in Connecticut and from my 
colleagues all over the country is that distance learning, 
efforts of unemployed to connect to jobs, all are hampered by 
the lack of connectivity. And I held a round table in Hartford 
with educators, our superintendent of schools, Mayor, parents, 
community groups, all of them crying out for more connectivity. 
We need a bold plan and leadership. Senator Wyden and I 
introduced the Emergency Broadband Connections Act along with 
24 colleagues.
    I led a letter with 26 of my Senate colleagues writing to 
Congressional leadership calling for $1 billion right away for 
Lifeline. I would hope and presume that all the members of this 
panel agree that Lifeline needs more funding during this 
crisis. Let me get from each of you an estimate of how much you 
think ought to be allotted to this program? Beginning with you, 
Mr. Power.
    Mr. Power. Thank you, Senator. Yes, well, we are very happy 
to be supportive of Senator Markey's bill. That is our getting 
$4 billion to augment the E-Rate program and we have also been 
discussing with members our program which is similar to your 
proposal. But you are absolutely right. I was happy to be a 
part of the original implementation of E-Rate twenty years ago 
and our members certainly support Senator Markey and your 
efforts to bolster Lifeline.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you. I will just go down the 
panel.
    Mr. Gibson. Yes, Senator Blumenthal, thank you for the 
question. I don't necessarily have the expertise to comment on 
how much but I suggest that based on your testimony it should 
be more. I haven't personally experienced, I don't live 
necessarily in a deep rural area, but I get my Internet through 
a wireless Internet service provider and while I have the means 
to pay for it, it is not cheap.
    And the situation I have is my local, the local cable 
company is just as unwilling unless I spend something like 
$10,000 throwing cable out my way. So I certainly have a 
feeling and our company, you know, certainly have a feeling we, 
again as I said in my testimony, have really been trying to 
support rural broadband in the pandemic with some creative 
approaches with setting up access points and LTE backhaul. So 
we think that, I would defer to Mr. Power and others that have 
expertise in the amount, but I think I would agree it could be 
more.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you. Ms. Layton.
    Ms. Layton. Senator, thank you for your commitment to the 
people of Connecticut. I think Lifeline actually needs to have 
major reform. I don't think that the model is working. What I 
would advocate, however, would be the participation of the 
Internet content providers, notably the video providers who 
provide 80 percent of the data that goes across the network. 
They are not participating today in the process. They make a 
lot of money. They are getting the benefits of users using the 
networks and they should be part of the funding.
    Senator Blumenthal. And our last panelist, Mr. Calabrese.
    Mr. Calabrese. Yes, Senator. Yes, my organization like the 
broader public interest community supports these bills, the 
Accessible Affordable Broadband Act, I believe it is called, 
and you know in the Senate HR2, in the House, which provide I 
believe somewhat more than $8 billion in emergency broadband 
relief, essentially a Lifeline supplement, you know, for the 
duration of the crisis.
    And, you know that is certainly needed now along with, you 
know, what as Tom mentioned Senator Markey's proposal that I 
believe is also in that same bill for E-rate. You know, we need 
both of those and another $4 billion for E-rate. And I would 
also mention that we should be including both for now and for 
the long run more flexibility for E-rate so that school 
districts can decide for themselves the best use of these 
funds, the most cost-effective way to connect students at home.
    Senator Blumenthal. I agree completely on e-rate. I am a 
strong supporter of the Senator Markey's bill. We have these 
combined efforts. I am hopeful that the measure that my 
Republican colleagues will announce shortly for the next corona 
virus relief package will include a necessary and robust 
commitment to broadband, whether it is through Lifeline, E-rate 
or any of the other programs that connect carriers and 
subscribers. And yes, there may be a need for reform but right 
now in all areas, not just rural areas, but all areas, there is 
a lack of connectivity which leads to the homework gap and the 
digital divide. So I feel strongly we need to move forward. 
Thank you very much to all the panelists.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Blumenthal.
    Senator Moran.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JERRY MORAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM KANSAS

    Senator Moran. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Thank you 
to our panelists for being here and being present maybe is a 
better way of saying that. Let me direct this question to Mr. 
Power. In my role on this committee, but also is the 
Appropriations Chairman for CJS, I oversee the formal dispute 
resolution process stemming from U.S. interagency spectrum 
policy decisionmaking. It is my understanding that the FCC is 
the Federal agency with authority for managing all non-Federal 
Government spectrum while NTIA manages and assign spectrum 
holdings for the Federal agencies. Is that a fair assessment of 
the circumstance?
    Mr. Power. That is right, Senator.
    Senator Moran. Is there an existing formal process for 
agencies like the FCC and NTIA to resolve disputes revolving 
around spectrum policy determinations?
    Mr. Power. There is a memo of understanding between them. I 
don't think it is particularly detailed. I think it is more of 
an informal relationship that helps solve those problems.
    Senator Moran. Are these differences, when in determining 
U.S. input into international standard setting versus a general 
domestic spectrum determination, is there a difference?
    Mr. Power. Yes. So, you know on the international stage is 
the international telecommunication union, which is a subset of 
the U.N. that helps harmonize spectrum decisions worldwide. And 
so the State Department steps in to be the U.S. representative 
there and works within NTIA and the FCC to develop the U.S. 
position, and with industry, to develop the U.S. positions in 
advance of those international conferences.
    Senator Moran. So in the case of a dispute between NTIA and 
FCC, theoretical dispute, who reigns? Is there a third party 
that then steps in?
    Mr. Power. It is on the international context, it is the 
State Department that leads and is the convener of that 
mediation process and ultimately makes the decision when it is 
on the international stage.
    Senator Moran. Outside of the international setting, who is 
the dispute resolution authority between the NTIA and the FCC?
    Mr. Power. It is a shared responsibility, Senator. I think 
it can work well. I think it has worked well. We have obviously 
seen some challenges in the last couple of years, but I think 
greater collaboration and getting the engineers, the folks who 
know this stuff, in the room together and focused on the 
issues, I think that is the best way----
    Senator Moran. Do Federal agencies file comments? Do they 
provide testimony in front of the FCC on these kind of issues?
    Mr. Power.--it happens. You know, I am an alum of NTIA and 
our role, we thought, was to coordinate the agencies and have 
NTIA and the Administration speak with one voice to the FCC. I 
think the FCC needs to hear from one voice in a coordinated 
fashion, but there are exceptions to the rule.
    Senator Moran. Dr. Layton, is there a consequence to 
economic valuation of spectrum if an agency involved in these 
dispute resolution process tries to affect the policy changes 
outside that process? Does it set a precedent for future 
spectrum policies?
    Ms. Layton. Yes.
    Senator Moran. Any further thoughts on that topic?
    Ms. Layton. Well, we know the saying you give them an inch 
they take a yard. So I mean if you can get away with 
something----
    Senator Moran. That is--thank you for putting it in a way 
that I understand.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Layton. Obviously, I think pricing would bring a lot 
of--reduce the level of politics but failing that, I would 
encourage the Committee to look at the carrots and sticks that 
it has at its disposal. We talked about things today, the 
dashboards for the Federal use, report cards to grade the 
Federal agencies on how well they are using the spectrum, and I 
would also like my fellow people in the policy community, we 
can also do more work to look at the past disputes, test them, 
and see were the concerns actually realized. There is a lot of 
fights about interference, so we need to do more ex-post 
analyses. Every agency will come forth with a Y2K-like scenario 
that never comes to pass and we need to hold them accountable.
    Senator Moran. My assumption is that uncertainty and time 
delays causes spectrum to have less value or less interest in 
those who want to bid. Let me again ask Mr. Power, the 600 
megahertz incentive auction and the broadcaster repack, I think 
that probably was a pretty good model. Congress demonstrated 
strong support for ensuring a smooth and safe transition by 
appropriating additional funds under their RAY BAUM's Act which 
I led with Senator Schatz.
    And your wireless carrier members were also proactive in 
supporting the reallocation of broadcasters technically and 
financially. While there are still some broadcast stations that 
need to finalize their transition to a permanent channel, the 
effort has largely been a success to date. As such, can you 
walk us through some of the lessons that private industry and 
the FCC learned or maybe should have learned from the incentive 
auction and how those lessons can be applied in the future?
    Mr. Power. It has been a success. I think one of the great 
lessons from that is the confidence that Chairman Thune and 
others have expressed in the FCC as being the agency with the 
experts that can manage these processes. There were a lot of 
naysayers before that auction and particular with respect to 
the repacking process. It has proven to be quite successful and 
kudos to the FCC for that.
    Senator Moran. I found myself, Mr. Chairman, looking at the 
screen instead of the witnesses. I am sorry. I have been to 
football games in which I only look at the Jumbotron now, but 
it is nice to have you here in person and by virtual presence. 
Thank you.
    Senator Thune. And when you look at your screen, you see 
yourself.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Thune. Just as a quick follow-up, we are going to 
go to Senator Rosen next, but to Senator Moran's question on 
disputes. As policymakers are there areas in the process that 
we ought to consider changing in that dispute resolution 
process between commercial and Federal spectrum?
    Ms. Layton. Can you ask the question one more time?
    Senator Thune. Well, he talked about the FCC and NTIA 
disputes, how those are resolved, and one deals with commercial 
loan, another deals with Federal spectrum. And I guess the 
question is, are there things that we ought to be doing as 
policymakers to change that process so that there is less 
confusion and less conflict?
    Mr. Power. I know from the industry side, one of the 
challenges we face is understanding how the Federal systems 
work and information sharing so that we can work around their 
systems and figure out how best to relocate or otherwise 
accommodate their systems. Oftentimes agencies are reluctant to 
share information with us and sometimes with good reason given 
some security concerns. But, if we could enhance the 
transparency of what is underlying the Federal systems and 
there are challenges, that could help.
    Mr. Gibson. And I would add to that too that two things, 
one is that I think so many refer to MOU that talks about how 
the interactions between the two agencies work. And while that 
may not be the purview of the Committee, it is 17 years old, so 
it might be worthwhile to go back and maybe put a process in 
place that that MOU is reviewed almost by design more 
frequently so that it is updated. And the other thing is I 
think the IRAC process as Mr. Power alluded to and Mr. Moran 
alluded to as well, is a little arcane and murky as well.
    And we participated in it quite frequently in the work we 
do in some of the cross-boundary coordination between 
commercial and Federal systems. So those are probably two areas 
that could, as I said in my testimony, merit some revisiting 
and renewing.
    Senator Thune. I said----
    Mr. Calabrese. If I can, Senator----
    Senator Thune. Mr. Calabrese.
    Mr. Calabrese. I mentioned in my testimony several ways to 
improve that process and I believe it does begin as we have 
heard with updating the Memorandum of Understanding. Right now, 
it is very vague. It provides for a 15-day consultation period 
which is obviously too short and late. In reality, that does 
begin much earlier, but it needs to be more specific. There 
needs to be a specific process for escalating disagreement. So 
you begin with the engineers but it needs to go all the way up.
    And perhaps the most important thing here is there needs to 
be a guiding and mediating effort at the White House level, a 
spectrum management team, for example, that was recommended by 
the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technologies 
in their report back in 2012 so that when these escalates, you 
have officials who are in the best position to distill what is 
the broader public interest on these disputes.
    And finally the agencies need to be filing data in the FCC 
proceedings while they were actually happening instead of 
waiting until after the FCC has come to a tentative conclusion 
and then at the last minute raising objections and even then 
often being unwilling to provide engineering data.
    Senator Thune. OK. Great, thank you. And I said Senator 
Rosen is up next. Actually Senator Klobuchar is back. She was 
here earlier and she is up next.
    Senator Klobuchar.

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much. I have returned 
remotely, but it was great to hear all your testimony in person 
and thanks for holding this hearing Senator Thune and Senator 
Schatz. I know that there have been some questions from Senator 
Tester and others about rural areas and as Co-Chair of the 
Senate Broadband Caucus, I am very focused on this. We have got 
42 million Americans lacking access to broadband. We have a 
real opportunity right now.
    Senator Cramer and I have a bipartisan bill to work with 
our rural providers and we also have a bill that I am leading 
that has actually passed the House that Representative Clyburn 
has to invest in broadband. Maybe when I go over this, anything 
you haven't said yet about this Mr. Calabrese, but funding that 
should be used to expand broadband access in unserved or 
underserved communities.
    In your testimony, you note that C-band spectrum is grossly 
underutilized and could be used to deploy more rural broadband. 
Could you talk about what more can be done as soon as possible 
given what we are seeing with the pandemic?
    Mr. Calabrese. Yes, so thank you, Senator. I noted earlier 
in case you didn't hear it that, you know, that Open Technology 
Institute and the broad public interest communities supports 
your accessible, affordable legislation, of course, the 
Emergency Broadband Funding, additional E-rate funding, and so 
on, specifically on rural what you mentioned about spectrum. 
Spectrum is a public resource owned by the people and what we 
need to think about is not just universal service subsidies, 
you know, money from taxpayers, but also spectrum as 
infrastructure.
    I mentioned earlier there to Senator Tester that there are, 
for example, as you know, more than 1,500 small, mostly small 
wireless Internet service providers in rural areas primarily, 
but also all kinds of other providers increasingly use fixed 
wireless to reach these areas at much lower cost than fiber. 
And what they rely on primarily is unlicensed spectrum.
    And so the 6 gigahertz Order the Commission adopted in 
April is critical to that by really expanding the bandwidth, 
but even beyond that what we need to do is identify these 
underutilized bands such as C-band, 12 gigahertz, and so on, 
and allow coordinated shared access where that spectrum is 
vacant.
    Senator Klobuchar. Yes. I see Senator Fischer remotely 
there and she and I actually got something signed into law in 
2018 on this and I just cannot emphasize how much to my 
colleagues we need to do something. One last quick question on 
911. I do a lot of work in that area with law enforcement and 
the need for upgrades with 911 in light of our whole new system 
was set up of course before everyone had cell phones and 
everyone could send pictures of burning buildings to fire 
department so that they know what the floor plan is before they 
go in and risk their lives. Can you speak to how funding from 
spectrum of options can support the deployment of 911?
    Mr. Calabrese. Yes, you know, I believe that what we should 
be doing for that purpose for rural broadband for adoption in 
low-income areas is actually capturing the share of auction 
revenue and dedicating it to a digital divide trust fund that 
can be used for a number of purposes including that one. And so 
we have supported the Smart Act, for example, with Senator 
Schatz and others introduced, you know, that would take C-band 
auction revenue and I deal with you larger share of it 
including by reducing the incentive payments and put it to that 
use and others.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. One last question. You can take this 
or maybe one of our other witnesses and that is, underserved 
communities, which of course includes minority communities as 
rural areas, but it also includes tribes and they have been hit 
particularly hard by the pandemic and they need equitable 
access to spectrum.
    In May, Senator Heinrich and 16 of us sent a letter urging 
the FCC to extend the rural tribal priority window period for 
tribes to complete their applications for spectrum for wireless 
broadband increase for mobile coverage. Could you or any of the 
other witnesses talk about why it is important to support this 
extension period to help tribes access unused spectrum?
    Mr. Calabrese. Yes, I can. I mentioned at the end of my 
opening Statement that the tribal priority window closes on 
August 3, and because of the crisis, the tribal areas have not 
had time to really--have not had the opportunity to make the 
assessment in the application. And so that definitely needs to 
be extended. This is for the 2.5 gigahertz spectrum which 
schools have license for educational broadcast spectrum.
    So before there is an option of what remains, we need to 
give tribal, rural tribal areas a fair opportunity to apply for 
that spectrum because really they need--their coverage is 
terrible and they need a lower cost way to build out wireless.
    Senator Klobuchar. All right. Thank you very much. And 
thank you to the rest of the witnesses.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Senator 
Fischer is up next. Also joins us virtually.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DEB FISCHER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA

    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you 
having this important hearing today. Achieving more efficient 
use of our Federal spectrum is critical. While recognizing the 
continued importance of exclusive licensing, we must keep in 
mind certain spectrum bands that are mission critical and 
Federal users who cannot vacate a specific band entirely.
    Our spectrum policies need to be adaptable to accommodate 
these circumstances. The Citizens Broadband Radio Service has 
been a major step forward for spectrum sharing system on this 
front given the significant partnership among the FCC, the 
NTIA, DOD, and commercial entities. Mr. Gibson, in terms of the 
broader implications on U.S. spectrum policy, what do you 
believe worked particularly well in developing the CBRS 
framework?
    Mr. Gibson. Thank you, Senator Fischer. That is a very good 
question. I would say that probably the thing that worked best 
was collaboration among stakeholders. We went into this and 
actually we had some experience from AWS-3, which was probably 
preceded CBRS by about at least 5 years.
    And again, that was thanks to the leadership of NTIA and 
FCC where we got together between commercial users and Federal 
users and got to know each other, and we weren't so scary and 
we were able to work things out into AWS-3. So we took that 
experience into CBRS, and thanks to the leadership of people 
like Fred Moorefield and Tom Taylor and others in the 
Department of Defense, we were able to get together and hash 
through a lot of very complex issues and it was ongoing.
    So I would say probably the major thing that we were able 
to work through that is successful for CBRS is the ability to 
collect to collaborate among the Federal users. And we think it 
sets up a framework going forward. Thank you.
    Senator Fischer. If I could follow up with you, thinking of 
the technologies that have really evolved to support spectrum 
sharing and new device operations without having to move 
incumbents, what other examples do you feel are the most 
promising on this front?
    Mr. Gibson. Thank you. I would say the next thing in the 
pipeline is the automatic frequency coordinating aspect in 6 
gigahertz. That band, and I think you have heard some folks 
allude to it today, was just reallocated for unlicensed use but 
there are still about 50,000 microwave systems that operate in 
those bands that use about four hundred and some odd thousand 
frequencies.
    So the automated frequency coordinating system is a way to 
allow unlicensed operation around the microwave system so they 
don't cause interference. And it is built on CBRS and some 
other things that we have worked on in spectrum sharing 
paradigms. And so we think that that is sort of a good 
evolution of how we can take spectrum sharing sort of into the 
21st century.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you. Mr. Calabrese, as you noted in 
your testimony, the demand for spectrum capacity will grow as 
the Internet of Things continues to develop. Estimates predict 
there will be over 125 billion devices that will be connected 
to the Internet by 2030.
    And as we all know, we are going to need a robust portfolio 
of licensed and unlicensed spectrum to support industrial and 
commercial IoT to develop deployment. Given the private LTE 
capabilities enabled by the CBRS, how will this create added 
resources for IoT connectivity, particularly with the spotted 
coverage in buildings for IoT devices?
    Mr. Calabrese. Yes, actually that was one of the great 
innovations of CBRS was the notion that our policy for the 
licensed spectrum previously had been mostly about wide area 
coverage for cell phones and mobile broadband for consumers, 
but, as IoT emerges, what is increasingly important is giving 
building owners, factories, ports, schools, campuses, direct 
access to the airwaves so that they can connect their own 
networks and customize their own networks or hire third-party 
integrators to do so.
    So CBRS is part of that effort, I believe, conscious effort 
by the FCC and now other countries following us, the UK, 
Germany, to make spectrum, low power spectrum like this 
available directly to users, enterprise users on a local basis. 
And so they can choose by doing, you know, something like 
private LTE on CBRS or now, thanks to the FCC's order on April, 
there is so much more unlicensed capacity, very high capacity 
unlicensed that can be used in 6 gigahertz for the same 
purpose. So this is really going to spur innovation in IoT and 
private networks.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Fischer. Next up joining 
us also remotely is Senator Rosen.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JACKY ROSEN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Rosen. Thank you, Chairman Thune, Ranking Member 
Schatz, all the witnesses for being here today. I would like to 
build upon Senator Klobuchar's question on the tribal window 
extension.
    And so I would like to submit for the record a letter from 
the National Congress of American Indians, the American Library 
Association, the National Hispanic Media Coalition, and 
relevant stakeholders requesting that the FCC extend the 2.5 
gigahertz rural tribal priority window deadline.
    With tribes dealing with the impact of the current virus 
pandemic, extending this window gives tribes such as the Duck 
Valley Indian Colony and Pyramid Lake tribes time and 
opportunity to access unused spectrum to connect to the 
internet. We will send that over to you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Thune. Without objection.
    [The information referred to follows:]

                                                      July 23, 2020
Senator John Thune,
United States Senate SD-511,
Washington, DC.

Senator Brian Schatz,
722 Hart Senate Office Building,
Washington, DC.

     Re: Extending the 2.5 GHz Rural Tribal Priority Window

Dear Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Schatz,

    Attached please find a letter signed by 48 organizations including 
Tribal organizations, broadband providers, digital inclusion advocates, 
and others supporting broadband access for all, in support of the 
Motion to extend the deadline for the 2.5 GHz Rural Tribal Priority 
Window, filed by the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), 
Southern California Tribal Chairmen's Association (SCTCA), AMERIND Risk 
Management, and Public Knowledge. The Motion supported by these nearly 
50 organizations asks the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to 
extend the deadline for eligible federally-recognized Tribes to file 
applications for 5G spectrum licenses on Tribal lands.
    At the moment, the Tribal Priority Window is scheduled to close on 
August 3, 2020. Unfortunately, because of the pandemic, hundreds of 
eligible Tribes will not be able to meet this deadline. Unless the FCC 
acts to extend the deadline, more than 80 percent of eligible Tribes 
will be foreclosed from applying for this one-time opportunity to 
receive critical spectrum licenses necessary for providing broadband 
services to Native American reservations, Alaskan Native villages, and 
Native Hawaiian communities.
    As you are both aware, Native American communities have suffered 
terribly as a result of the pandemic. It would be cruel for eligible 
Tribes to lose this unique opportunity to receive spectrum licenses 
that will enable them to provide broadband to their people. As Chairman 
Pallone observed at the recent hearing on the impact of COVID-19 on 
Native Americans, ``Tribes deserve better.''
    We therefore ask you to include this letter in the record of this 
morning's hearing, ``The State of U.S. Spectrum Policy.'' We also ask 
that you and your colleagues support the request of NCAI, SCTCA, and 
nearly 50 other organizations to extend the deadline of the 2.5 GHz 
Rural Tribal Priority Window to February 1, 2021. This will give 
hundreds of federally-recognized Native Americans, Native Alaskans, and 
Native Hawaiians a genuine opportunity to provide 5G broadband for 
themselves, and to exercise sovereignty over their digital future.

Re: Rural Tribal Priority Window, Transforming the 2.5 GHz 
                                     Band, WT Docket 18-120

Dear Secretary Dortch,

    The undersigned groups write to express support for the National 
Congress of American Indians, et al., in urging the Federal 
Communications Commission to adopt an ``Emergency Motion for Stay of 
the 2.5 GHz Rural Tribal Priority Window.'' Doing so would extend the 
application deadline for 182 days due to the significant impact the 
COVID-19 crisis has had on American Indian Tribes, Native Hawaiian 
communities, and Alaska Native villages across the Nation.
    As the Federal Communications Commission itself has declared, 
broadband is needed ``for every facet of daily life.'' However, less 
than half of housing units on rural Tribal lands have access to 
broadband. In order to ensure ``meaningful access'' to communications 
services for underserved Tribes, the FCC created the Rural Tribal 
Priority Window, which allows Tribes to apply for free spectrum in the 
2.5 GHz band in order to deploy wireless broadband on their lands. 
Unfortunately, approximately 80 percent of eligible Tribes will not be 
able to take advantage of this spectrum unless the FCC extends the 
deadline.
    Despite the promise of this opportunity for Tribal communities, 
Tribes have faced significant hurdles to finishing their applications 
on time due to the COVID-19 crisis. Many Tribes lack the expertise to 
navigate the FCC application process and the vast majority of 
application workshops intended to help them were cancelled, as were 
other forms of in-person outreach. An informal review by MuralNet 
estimates that 20 percent of applications already submitted will need 
to be amended or are missing necessary filings. This is particularly 
troubling as the FCC has made it clear the agency will not allow any 
major application amendments after the deadline, essentially 
eliminating a Tribe's opportunity to correct any mistakes.
    Moreover, the global pandemic has delayed work on the applications 
and Tribal decision-making because many people have been incapacitated 
by the COVID-19 virus. Those able to work must generally do so from 
home--often without the very broadband access the application is meant 
to provide. We cannot expect Tribes to complete work that requires 
broadband when they don't have broadband.
    By refusing to extend the Rural Tribal Priority Window, the FCC 
will prevent the vast majority of eligible Tribes from accessing this 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity--due to circumstances wholly outside of 
Tribal control. The FCC will also fail to achieve its own policy goals 
of promoting Tribal connectivity. Extending the 2.5 GHz Rural Tribal 
Priority Window is one small way the FCC can fulfill its commitment to 
Tribes. Doing so is the first step to addressing the inequities of this 
underserved population, giving Tribes, Native Hawaiian communities, and 
Alaska Native villages an actual chance to secure broadband access for 
their communities.

    Senator Rosen. Thank you. I would like to speak now, my 
question on the lack of a national 5G strategy. You know, I 
represent the great State of Nevada and so whether it is the 
self-driving cars that ride along the Las Vegas strip, the 
drones that are taking flight over the City of Reno, we host 
the largest technology show in the world. Of course in Las 
Vegas as well. Nevada, we are at the forefront of innovation.
    And in order to continue that momentum, bring about 
advancements in transportation, healthcare, and communications, 
we need a national 5G strategy just like we know we need a 
national coronavirus pandemic strategy. But with its low 
latency and high bandwidth, 5G has the power to transform our 
national economy and Nevada's economy at a time when we really 
need it.
    Just as 4G ushered in smartphones, 5G will make what we 
consider futuristic, autonomous vehicles, advanced robotics, 
remote surgeries a reality. The transition from 4 to 5G will 
require close coordination and cooperation among Federal 
agencies tasked with managing our national airwaves, but there 
has been recent disagreements between Federal agencies and how 
to proceed on key spectrum decisions and they have left some to 
question why we lack a unified voice or vision on this issue.
    So to everyone on the panel, what benefits would such a 
strategy provide and why is having a national strategy rather 
than 51 state strategies important? So let's begin with Mr. 
Calabrese and we can go down line to Mr. Power, Mr. Gibson, and 
Dr. Layton, please.
    Mr. Calabrese. OK. Thank you, Senator. That is a very, very 
important question. So we you know, I would say first that the 
FCC has a 5G spectrum strategy. If you want to get the 5G fast 
plan, which is basically about pushing out as much spectrum as 
possible, mid band and high band for both licensed and 
unlicensed, but you are correct that beyond the FCC's spectrum 
strategy for 5G, there is no National 5G policy or strategy 
that really is looking at, OK, how are we going to get it?
    You know, make sure it is available everywhere for what is 
most important, and also to resolve some of these conflicts 
between the FCC and different agencies. And one suggestion I 
have is that really we need--the White House, at the White 
House level we need to engage. Leadership needs to engage much 
more directly first putting out a strategy with clear 
priorities so that all the Federal agencies are going in the 
same direction and then there needs to be some type of spectrum 
management team in the Executive Office of the President that 
resolves these disputes and make sure that they are following a 
broader National strategy and National interest.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. Mr. Power, would you like to 
briefly make a comment how 50-state overarching strategy could 
help us be more effective here?
    Mr. Power. Certainly. Thank you, Senator. We certainly need 
this to be handled at the Federal level. That is the role of 
the FCC when it comes to deploying commercial spectrum and 
there are a myriad reasons for that but a big one, of course, 
is that the Federal Government sits on a lot of the spectrum, 
most of the spectrum, and we need to work with the Defense 
Department and the other agencies to free that up.
    And this committee has done so much historically to ensure 
the rollout of spectrum. We are going to have the auction 
starting today, another auction in December, and then there is 
one more auction scheduled for 2024. But beyond that we don't 
have a pipeline and this committee could do a great service to 
the Nation to help with 5G deployment by helping to develop a 
longer-term spectrum pipeline for the advancement of 5G.
    Senator Rosen. I believe I just about ran out of time. So I 
thank you for your comments. I will submit questions for the 
record. I just want to be sure that the U.S. doesn't lose 
ground in the race to 5G. That is really going to hurt us going 
forward. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Rosen. And now virtually 
is Senator Blackburn on. Senator Blackburn. If not, I believe 
Senator Capito is ready to ask questions.
    Senator Capito.
    [No response.]
    Senator Thune. All right, Senator Lee.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE LEE, 
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM UTAH

    Senator Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am really glad that 
we are having this hearing. I am also very glad that the FCC is 
working to conduct auctions on the C-band and CBRS for 5G 
networks. This is a good thing. Mr. Power, is our commercial 
spectrum pipeline nearing depletion, and can we really afford 
to wait to identify new bands?
    Mr. Power. It is nearing depletion and now is the time to 
act, Senator. Agree.
    Senator Lee. I couldn't agree more. We can't afford to 
wait. Dr. Layton, the Federal Government owns a lot of spectrum 
and doesn't necessarily operate everything efficiently. The 
Federal Government is known for many things, efficiency isn't 
always one of them. And it is understandable. This is a biggest 
organization that exists on planet Earth. Can we win our 5G 
race with China if we refuse to include Federal agency bands in 
our analysis of our Nation's spectrum inventory as we assess 
that inventory?
    Ms. Layton. No.
    Senator Lee. We can't do it. It can't be done without 
evaluating that. So we will lose to China if we don't do that.
    Ms. Layton. Yes.
    Senator Lee. OK. Thank you. I appreciate that. Do you agree 
that the opportunity cost data would help us identify bands 
that have inefficiencies in them and that this could help us 
replenish our spectrum pipeline?
    Ms. Layton. Yes, and I applaud the bill that you have put 
forth to get at this information. I think it is critical.
    Senator Lee. Thank you. I appreciate that. The bill that 
she is referring to of course is my bill, the Government 
Spectrum Evaluation Act, to help us identify the true 
opportunity costs that are associated with sitting on that and 
not doing other things with it. It is not the case, it can 
never be assumed to be the case that the Federal Government is 
omnipotent and omniscient, that it knows everything it is 
supposed to do including with broadband. Given how much 
beachfront property the Government owns, we shouldn't be 
insulating the Government from that kind of evaluation. Mr. 
Power, do you agree with Dr. Layton's assessment?
    Mr. Power. I certainly do and I think one of the other 
advantages of your Act, Senator, is that it could provide 
incentives to the agencies. Because the way the spectrum 
relocation fund works is when they give up spectrum, some of 
that revenue can go back to the agencies to upgrade their 
systems. And members of this committee are working on improving 
that process as well. And so I think with the agencies 
themselves are educated as to the value of their spectrum, they 
may actually wake up and see some opportunities.
    Senator Lee. That is a fantastic point. I am glad you 
raised that. Dr. Layton, do you agree that insulating Federal 
spectrum bands from analysis, in addition to causing other 
problems in the commercial space, it also probably causes 
greater inefficiencies and it precludes other opportunities 
within the Federal bands?
    Ms. Layton. That is absolutely the case. I think that 
because the various agencies have not been operating with the 
same market restraints, that they haven't made the best 
decisions in their own technology. They are incentivized to 
make inefficient decisions.
    Senator Lee. So all of these things considered, can we 
afford to wait 10 years to make spectrum decisions?
    Ms. Layton. No.
    Senator Lee. And does waiting longer, sort of, indicate 
that we have got a broken decisionmaking process?
    Ms. Layton. Yes. I mean, there should be ways to make the 
agencies feel the pain of the opportunity cost.
    Senator Lee. Dr. Layton, in your testimony you discuss 
common law property rights related to spectrum and to the 
emergence of the secondary market. Do you have any 
recommendations for how Congress could reform our current 
spectrum secondary market and push an allocation process that 
is more market-based?
    Ms. Layton. So, you know, obviously I would like the full 
privatization, but failing that, to look at a pricing regime. 
The United Kingdom started pricing for Federal agencies in 2007 
where they actually would require police, different Government 
agencies pay for the rights that they use. So that has been 
started in some places. It creates accountability and 
respecting, using the resources better. So what has worked in 
the FCC, I think it could also work for Federal spectrum.
    Senator Lee. And the costs of not doing that would be what?
    Ms. Layton. Well, I mean if anyone believes that 4G has 
mattered to the United States, what would our world--what would 
America be like if we didn't have 4G? So I think it could be 
catastrophic. We are assuming the future of our Nation will be 
built upon wireless technologies. So we should be all in on 
doing this.
    Senator Lee. Right. And finally, the jump from 4G to 5G is 
not just the incremental step that the number would represent, 
right? Isn't it almost the difference between pong on the 
original video game consoles?
    Ms. Layton. Right. It is a stepwise function. What we are 
talking about is industrial applications not just being able 
to, you know, get all of your information through the air, all 
of your video content, but we are talking about entire new 
industries, right, where we put the, you know, the energy 
industry online, we put all of the cities online, we put all of 
our education and health, reinvent all of our industries. So 
that is what we mean with 5G and it shouldn't be stopping with 
5G. I mean we should be going to 6G and so on.
    Senator Lee. But to get there we have got to have spectrum. 
To have spectrum, we have got to evaluate what we have got. And 
to do that, we have got to review Federal allocations.
    Ms. Layton. And we need your bill.
    Senator Lee. Thank you very much. I appreciate you saying 
that and it is good to have the Chairman and the Whip here to 
hear that. Thank you.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Thune. Well played, the Senator from Utah. 
Senator--I am going to give--Senator Blackburn, are you there?
    Senator Blackburn.

              STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE

    Senator Blackburn. Yes. Yes, I am here.
    Senator Thune. All right. Senator Blackburn, you are up.
    Senator Blackburn. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I 
appreciate so much that we are having this today and to our 
witnesses, I want to say thank you so much for being here to 
talk about spectrum policy. And in our office, we talked a 
little bit about how appropriate it is that we are having this 
hearing today as the bidding begins on the Citizens Broadband 
Radio Service auctioning off priority access licenses to 
support our 5G infrastructure.
    And of course, I appreciate hearing the comments about 
that. And we all know and appreciate that this CBRS auction is 
a little bit different of a template than our previous efforts. 
And I am going to be watching this very closely to see if we 
can determine if this is the right model that we need to be 
following. And one thing I will say, having done a virtual town 
hall meeting with Johnson County, Tennessee this morning is 
that the pandemic and the need to utilize telehealth and then 
as children are going back to school, the fact that systems 
have to have both a policy for remote learning and well as in 
class learning and shared time learning, they have got to have 
that in place and we have really seen via the pandemic the 
digital divide.
    And the fact that we still have Tennessee communities that 
are completely without access to high-speed internet. And our--
they are not even able to--they are still on dial-up or they 
have nothing at all. And in this County I talked to this 
morning, 58.6 percent of the households have a subscription. 
They have taken the service and of course it is available to 
more but still we are looking at lagging and we have to speed 
up these efforts as we look at and as the developed world looks 
at 5G spectrum assignment.
    So I would like to hear from each of you very quickly. If 
you just comment on the potential deployment delays or economic 
implications of the U.S. going our own way with spectrum 
allocation rather than assigning similar mid band spectrum as 
our international partners for next-generation mobile 
broadband? And so just start down the dais there.
    Mr. Power. Thank you, Senator. You know, I can't help but 
notice, as today is the opening of the CBRS auction, it is also 
opening day of Major League Baseball and they are playing under 
different rules and we don't know how it is going to go. And I 
think the same is true of the CBRS auction. Our members are 
participating. We are going to jump in with both feet, but it 
is untested and it is not what the rest of the world is doing 
with this band of spectrum.
    And among other things, it limits the power levels of the 
wireless carriers to about one-seventh of the power that they 
are used to using in nother bands. And when we talk about 
trying to build out past the urban areas into the suburban and 
into the rural areas, that presents a challenge. But we are we 
participating in it.
    We are hopeful that it does bring some successes but it 
does make us, sort of, the outlier in terms of mid-band and how 
this committee can really help is to restart the spectrum 
pipeline that Senator Lee was talking about because with this 
auction in the C-band auction in December, we will be just 
about at the end. So we will be happy to work with you and the 
other members of the Committee to develop the next pipeline to 
get us through the next few years.
    Mr. Gibson. And thank you, Senator Blackburn. This is Mr. 
Gibson. I think the question is profound, but I think there are 
more people that are going to be bidding in this auction than 
have ever been to an auction before. So that is 271 people. So 
the likelihood of putting spectrum in the hands of a lot of 
people are going to put it to use is high here, which is not to 
say that spectrum changes will follow in auctions, but they are 
going to be, at the end of the day, some twenty some thousand 
licenses that will be let.
    And so while that may be an outlier on the international 
stage, the United States, you know is different in some regards 
and it is important to you know, again have, you know, real 
connectivity based on what we have been hearing. And you know, 
we see lots of opportunity in the auction on a countywide 
basis. Obviously, we have interests in the spectrum access 
system that we are going to be developing to support that so we 
don't see any issues.
    Senator Blackburn. OK.
    Ms. Layton. I will be quick, Senator Blackburn. And just to 
thank you for all your leadership. You are such a champion on 
5G and so many digital tech policy issues. I am concerned we 
are too little too late. I mean as Mr. Gibson pointed out, 8 
years to get 70 megahertz for CBRS is too long. It is not 
enough. Even the power levels. It is a question about what we 
can do. All the same, I am delighted. I think it is symbolic. 
It is important tons of people will learn a lot from it, but we 
need a lot more. We have to just add another two zeros to 
everything we are doing. We are dancing around Federal 
holdings. We have to take the bull by the horns, and you have 
been such a champion about that. Thank you.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you. Mr. Calabrese.
    Mr. Calabrese. Yes, I would just note that as far as you 
know 3 gigahertz, this 3 gigahertz spectrum as well as a 
spectrum just below it, we are just simply in a very different 
situation in other countries because this is military radar 
spectrum and the judgment--I am not sure if it was correct but 
the judgment was that it would be too expensive and take too 
long for the Navy, for example, to replace its radar systems 
and move to a different band if another band could be found.
    And so the FCC really made the best of it in an incredibly 
productive way by, although it is lower power, the spectrum 
will be available to many new parties, you know, who will be 
coming in to do private LTE and more localized networks and 
innovation. So in fact now Europe is copying us in this respect 
of making spectrum on a more localized basis, small licenses 
available to more parties directly.
    Senator Blackburn. Well, I think we all can agree and my 
time has expired, but I think we can all agree whether we are 
talking about remote learning or telehealth or transactional 
lifestyle, remote working, or we are talking about great power 
competition, we have to get spectrum policy right and we have 
to get the deployment right and we want to be able to keep the 
standard setting with us and not have the Chinese take the lead 
in this. So it is imperative that we do this right. I 
appreciate each of you sharing your knowledge with us today. 
Thank you so much. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Blackburn.
    Senator Wicker.

                STATEMENT OF HON. ROGER WICKER, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI

    The Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I had an Opening Statement 
prepared and I ask that it be inserted into this morning's 
record at the appropriate time following other opening 
statements.
    Senator Thune. Without objection.
    [The information referred to was not available at time of 
printing.]
    The Chairman. Now, let me ask, follow up on something that 
Senator Schatz mentioned and I will begin with you, Mr. 
Calabrese, but I want all of the panelists to weigh in on this. 
It was mentioned that Commissioner Rosenworcel in a previous 
hearing had decried the inaccuracy of maps with regard to the 
RDOF. Now, it is my understanding that there are a number of 
criteria in place to make sure that RDOF funds go only to 
locations where there is no service at all.
    So help me out on this. Our complaint with the maps 
actually has been that they tended to overstate the coverage 
and say there was indeed adequate coverage where in fact there 
is none. Mr. Calabrese, there is no question that the RDOF 
funds will go where there is no coverage. And second, you are 
not suggesting or is anybody suggesting that we postpone the 
RDOF in order to get the maps absolutely right across the 
country? The complaint I have had is that RDOF is not happening 
soon enough.
    If we could move it earlier than October, people would like 
for us to do that. So are you suggesting in your answer to 
Senator Schatz's question that the RDOF should be postponed 
until we get the maps completely right? And are you suggesting 
that RDOF money is going to go where there is already coverage?
    Mr. Calabrese. Right. Thank you, Senator. No, I am not 
suggesting that it should be postponed entirely although it 
should be phased so that a larger share of the total money 
available over the next 10 years can be distributed with the 
knowledge of all the areas that are unserved. So you are 
correct that in this first round, roughly $16 billion out of 
the $20 billion over the next 10 years will be prioritized 
unserved areas.
    But as I mentioned earlier, industry mapping pilots have 
found that on the order of 38 percent of homes and businesses 
that the FCC marked as covered, do not have coverage and so 
they won't be considered. And really we need to be considering 
all the unserved areas before we give out the lion's share of 
the funds. So, certainly they should go ahead with the first 
two or three years? worth of funding but if Congress can move 
quickly to fund better mapping, that a year from now we could 
be distributing the remainder.
    The Chairman. Well, I think everyone in Congress and on 
this committee would be in favor of coming up with additional 
funds because the $16 billion is not going to be nearly enough. 
But do members of the panel wish to comment? And Dr. Layton, 
you have your hand up.
    Ms. Layton. First, I want to thank you. You have worked so 
hard on this issue to get at what to do about mapping. So thank 
you for that first of all. I would just say that good data can 
frequently cost money, but we should also recall, in 2010 I 
remember NTIA had something on the order of $100 billion to 
make a national broadband map. That money ran out and 2014.
    The map wasn't updated. So some notion that this has been a 
perennial problem and I am pleased to see that presently under 
Chairman Pai, we have at least seen industry to try to come 
forward through U.S. Telecom to try to find a long-term 
solution.
    I know they are still working through that. So it is just 
to say, it is a challenge, but I think you are correct to 
describe that this committee is trying to resolve it.
    The Chairman. Other people want to jump in on that? Should 
we postpone the RDOF or should we go ahead with the RDOF as it 
is currently constituted and authorized?
    Mr. Power. Yes, folks without broadband need broadband and 
their COVID environment has exacerbated those challenges so we 
need to get moving.
    Mr. Gibson. And I would agree. We shouldn't let the perfect 
be the enemy of the adequate. So I would say get going.
    The Chairman. Let's get started as soon as we can in this 
build on that. Mr. Calabrese, let me ask you, you have on page 
14 of your written testimony, you mention OTI as we as the 
Competitive Carriers Association, and INCOMPASS and other 
parties have urged FCC to launch a rulemaking to consider a 
petition filed four years by that Dish and other terrestrial 
licensees in the 12 gigahertz band. Why is this important and 
could you elaborate about why you wanted to include that in 
your testimony?
    Mr. Calabrese. Thank you, Senator. Yes, we filed, as you 
said, along with many other parties in support for the 
Commission to move forward based on a petition filed 4 years 
ago by Dish and others who won terrestrial licenses at an 
auction, but they are very limited. They are one way and an 
extremely low power. They are looking for flexible use right 
since this is 500 continuous megahertz of spectrum that 
although it is up to 12 gigahertz, is much, much better 
propagation than the high band spectrum that begins at 24 
gigahertz roughly.
    So this is great 5G spectrum, potentially, and so we think 
the FCC should launch to open a Notice of Rulemaking and not 
necessarily have, you know a set outcome, but here build a 
record because there are other considerations here including 
the fact that some of the small satellite constellation, SpaceX 
in particular, has rights and is beginning to use this band.
    And we also proposed that this will be great for rural 
areas because since even flexible use rights will probably need 
to be at a lower power and it will be used primarily at least 
initially more in urban areas, that the Commission should also 
allow rural broadband providers to coordinate shared use of 
this spectrum in less densely populated areas to enhance fixed 
wireless broadband offerings.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much. And Mr. Chairman, thank 
you for indulging me on the time. I think this has been a 
particularly informative subcommittee hearing so thank you, 
sir.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Wicker. I am going to, 
without objection, insert a letter from the Competitive 
Carriers Association into the hearing record as well and we 
will wrap it here in just a couple of minutes.

    Competitive Carriers Association (``CCA'') \1\ thanks the 
Subcommittee for holding today's hearing on ``The State of U.S. 
Spectrum Policy'' and respectfully requests that this letter be 
included in the hearing record. Clear and consistent spectrum 
management policies drive significant economic activity and support an 
ever-growing array of wireless services. As today's hearing reviews the 
role of the Federal Communication Commission (``FCC'') in spectrum 
management, CCA strongly supports continued direction from Congress 
that the FCC remains the agency of jurisdiction in commercial spectrum 
policy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ CCA is the Nation's leading association for competitive 
wireless providers and stakeholders across the United States. Members 
range from small, rural carriers serving fewer than 5,000 customers to 
regional and nationwide providers serving millions of customers, as 
well as vendors and suppliers that provide products and services 
throughout the wireless communications ecosystem. Visit 
www.ccamobile.org.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    For wireless technologies to benefit all consumers across the U.S., 
regardless of where they live, work, or travel, it is imperative that 
the Federal government work together to provide commercial access to 
low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum. These finite resources are key 
ingredients to fueling innovation and satisfying the ever-surging 
demand for mobile data and will be even more important as carriers work 
to deliver the connectivity promised by 5G networks. As our Nation's 
airwaves grow increasingly crowded, commercial spectrum policies must 
remain based on science and nonpolitical, and the FCC has been 
effective at developing and implementing these policies precisely 
because it has been driven by science rather than politics.
    FCC leadership on commercial spectrum management has greatly 
benefited our Nation. Not only does the United States lead the world in 
wireless services, but FCC-led spectrum auctions have generated over 
$120,000,000,000 in net winning bids, to the benefit of taxpayers. 
Continued success from future spectrum auctions depends on the bidders' 
trust that they can put licenses won at auction to use based on the 
service rules and underlying spectrum management policies established 
by the FCC. Trust in FCC analysis is also critical to meeting the 
policy goals to use spectrum ``as efficiently and effectively as 
possible to help meet our economic, national security, science, safety, 
and other Federal mission goals now and in the future,'' as outlined in 
the 2018 Presidential Memorandum on Developing a Sustainable Spectrum 
Strategy for America's Future.
    Any attempt to encroach on Congressionally-mandated FCC authority 
regarding commercial spectrum management, or to insert other Executive 
Branch Departments into the independent agency's process, prevents the 
FCC from utilizing its technical and engineering expertise in reaching 
decisions and would set a dangerous precedent. Further, the Committee 
on Commerce, Science, & Transportation, as well as this Subcommittee, 
must remain the appropriate committee of jurisdiction with authority 
over the FCC.
    American consumers benefit from digital opportunities and wireless 
services that result from clear, effective commercial spectrum 
management from the FCC. CCA commends ongoing leadership from this 
Subcommittee, and the full Committee, to support these opportunities 
and provide oversight for such a crucial American resource.
            Sincerely,
                                           Steven K. Berry,
                                                 President and CEO,
                                      Competitive Carriers Association.

    Senator Thune. I just have a couple of last questions to 
ask but thank you all.
    You have been very indulgent with your time. But as you can 
tell, a lot of interest in the subject and I think we have 
aired out a lot of good issues today. Mr. Power, in your 
testimony you mentioned that increasing the flexibility of the 
spectrum relocation fund would help spectrum efficiency. Can 
you elaborate on what potential changes we should consider to 
the SRF?
    Mr. Power. Certainly, Senator, Mr. Chairman. I think the 
spectrum relocation fund is obviously very well-intended and 
has worked to an extent to incentivize agencies to free up 
spectrum because then the portion of the proceeds of the 
auction comes back to them. I do think, from talking to some 
folks at the agencies, they almost see it as sort of status quo 
that they do the work to relocate their bands and then they get 
paid and then they are just back where they started from after 
doing a lot of work, and in their views, perhaps taking some 
risk.
    So I think if we can add to those incentives and make sure 
that they can use that money to do upgrades to systems and 
perhaps a little more flexibility in terms of planning. And so 
that the revenues aren't necessarily tied specifically to a 
particular auction or a particular band, that they can widen 
their lens a bit and get more of that revenue to become more 
efficient overall because that is what will ultimately lead to 
freeing up spectrum for commercial use.
    Senator Thune. And this has been covered pretty well, but I 
think it would be worth it just for purposes of kind of getting 
it--having it on the record. But just maybe you can answer 
this, you all can answer this, what happens if the United 
States does not make enough mid band spectrum available for 
commercial 5G services, and can United States have a vibrant 5G 
ecosystem without enough mid band commercial spectrum?
    Mr. Power. I would say what is at stake, we can learn from 
by looking back at 4G. The U.S. led the world in 4G and it 
meant not just spectrum availability and all the uses of 
spectrum that we derived from that, but it also created the app 
economy. That is a U.S. centric ecosystem. The two major 
operating systems for wireless devices. Those are U.S. 
dominated industries. It becomes this ecosystem that feeds and 
grows upon itself and that is the opportunity we have in 5G and 
that is the opportunity we have with mid band spectrum in 
particular.
    Right now as Chairman Pai and the FCC kick off the CBRS 
auction and now the C-band auction in December, those are two 
good moves, but we need this lower 3 gigahertz band spectrum, 
and we really need the help of the Administration, the Defense 
Department and this committee to get that band freed up to the 
greatest extent possible to then start catching up. Even with 
the auctions we have in place, we would not have caught up to 
China and many of the other countries. So that lower 3 
gigahertz band is really important.
    Ms. Layton. To piggyback on that and certainly I agree with 
what Mr. Power said. I would add that spectrum is almost--it is 
less important than the service development. If you look at 4G, 
the industries who profited were not necessarily the people who 
invested. So who really benefited from 4G was the device makers 
and the software systems, the apps, the platforms. And so 
similarly with 5G we don't even know yet to some extent will be 
these new industries that will come in the future.
    But to me, what is a really the critical issue is that what 
5G will enable in Quantum Computing and Robotics and Artificial 
Intelligence and so forth. We don't have the patents for those 
things today. And this is where China and other countries where 
it is a reset, right? It is a reset.
    There is not a particular advantage that we bring now and 
we need to put all the assets that we have as quickly as 
possible if we even want a chance at those next generation of 
things. So I don't think we can overstate how important this is 
today and thank you again for having this hearing.
    Mr. Gibson. And I would just add that one major aspect of 
the lower mid band is that it has now become The sweet spot. 
You know, in the time because of technology, the lower band, 
the 600 megahertz and below was sweet spot, but technology has 
caught up to the point where the 3 gigahertz band, the 3100 to 
3550 is a beautiful band for coverage.
    So we have heard a lot today about rural coverage. You 
really can't effectuate rural coverage much with millimeter 
wave or the really high band stuff. It just is not meant for 
that. So we really think that that lower mid band is just a 
really good sweet spot for the band. And again, 5G helps give 
us international competitiveness so we really need to keep 
pushing that.
    Mr. Calabrese. Yes, I would add that, yes, we very much 
support more spectrum, more mid-band spectrum for both licensed 
and unlicensed that is critical in thinking of a broader 5G 
wireless ecosystem that we have sufficient amount of both 
licensed and unlicensed in the mid band spectrum for the mobile 
carriers networks. The more spectrum they have, presumably, the 
more capacity and the lower the prices for consumers.
    So that is a good thing. But I would just note that in the 
spirit of not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good, in 
the 3 gigahertz spectrum below CBRS, which is also military 
radar spectrum today, we really need to press for a clear, 
technical answer in a sense or budgetary answer perhaps about 
how much of that can be cleared, if any, and then we should 
move to share the rest by extending the CBRS framework because 
that can be done rapidly and we can be having, you know, 
additional auctions for PAL licenses and additional general 
authorized access as well. So that may be the fastest way to 
make it available and for a wider variety of users as well.
    Senator Thune. All right, just perhaps last question. How 
do we account for spectrum needs which cannot be made public 
like those that affect our national security interests?
    Ms. Layton. So well, first of all, I don't think National 
Security is a static issue, and frequently, you know, some 
parties want to say well it is National Security, end of 
discussion and there is quite a bit of debate about what 
National Security is. And I think Mr. Power, in his testimony 
he described well I attempted to as well that our economy is a 
National Security issue, being able to compete with the next 
generation technologies is a National Security issue.
    The military, our adversaries will use next generation 
technologies to power their weapons. So we won't be able to 
compete as a military without the right networks and spectrum 
and so forth. I would recommend a great new book by Christian 
Brose called The Kill Chain, which is a critique of our 
military today that they have been incentivized to maybe not 
make the best technological decisions. They are bought in two 
platforms for example.
    Our adversaries are looking at the different modes of 
warfare. They may be smarter about how they use spectrum. But 
in any case, it would simply say that we can't stop our 
conversation about moving forward for spectrum for an excuse of 
National Security. It is part of realizing the right spectrum 
policy. And of course, we want to have a powerful military, 
they need to have their capabilities, but they also have to be 
smart about how they use resources.
    This is not a new concept. This was going on in World War 
II. There was a discussion around the broadcasters had to be 
able to use the spectrum the military wanted. It was important 
to have broadcasting to the American people during World War 
II. So this notion that somehow the military will always win 
and there are other uses is not there. There has always been 
this question, because we have an administrative allocation, 
about how do we balance the uses.
    Mr. Gibson. I would add to that that we had some experience 
in the past with a collaboration in DOD type discussions. When 
we were talking about this, we were able to sign non-disclosure 
agreements with the DOD and thereby we were able to share 
information. It was not necessarily classified. It was for 
official use only but it began to kind of give us a thinking 
that there is a way through collaborative process, allowing 
commercial interest to get involved with discussions on 
spectrum usage and we were able to actually make some very 
critical decisions that made the auction happen on time for 
AWS-3. So there is a framework, in fact, within the commerce 
spectrum management advisory committee.
    Shortly after that, we tried to study, a way that we could 
institutionalize a method whereby, through some aspects, 
through the Federal Advisory Committee Act or something, 
whereby commercial interest could help in these discussions. 
That never saw the light of day, but the fact that we were able 
to get NDAs in place and have these discussions with technical 
experts and spectrum experts on both sides of the discussion 
was, I think we called the trusted agent approach.
    So I would suggest that that be looked into in more detail 
and considered because we think that many of us still hold 
clearances from work we have done before and those clearances, 
we have gone through the vetting process. So it is possible to 
put that in place and allow us to continue to collaborate.
    Mr. Power. Mr. Chairman, in the last 10 years, the wireless 
carriers have become 42 times more efficient in their delivery 
of data. That is to say for every megahertz allocated to them, 
they are now carrying 42 times the amount of data as they did 
10 years ago. And they have invested hundreds of billions of 
dollars to achieve that and they do it because of the 
opportunity cost visited upon them by having owned the 
spectrum.
    I doubt there is anyone who can tell us what the efficiency 
gains, if any, there have been on the Federal side because they 
don't face those challenges, they don't face those incentives, 
they don't face those costs. So I think greater transparency 
into that issue and finding areas where they might be able to 
increase that efficiency because I suspect there are 
opportunities there.
    I think Senator Lee's bill would help us start to identify 
them. And then helping and working with the agencies who get 
the proceeds from these auctions to achieve those greater 
efficiencies. That is a win-win for everybody.
    Senator Thune. Well, I couldn't agree more. I just think 
that we have to figure this out and you know, the stakes are so 
high and our competitors are not having to delay and sit around 
dealing with the bureaucratic obstacles that we are having to 
deal with here.
    And I thank you for your advocacy. And I hope you will 
continue to be loud, strong voices on how important it is to 
figure these solutions out that enable us to get more of that 
critical spectrum available for 5G because I just think that 
the cost of not winning that race or at least not being 
competitive in that race are incredibly high for our country on 
many levels. So thanks for your testimony today.
    We will keep the hearing record open for a couple of weeks 
and during that time Senators are going to be asked to submit 
any questions for the record. And when you receive those 
questions, if you could submit your written answers to the 
Committee as soon as possible. They will be included in the 
permanent record and we would greatly appreciate the timeliness 
of your response.
    So thank you for being here today. And with that, we will 
adjourn this hearing.
    [Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

                                                      July 21, 2020
Hon. Roger Wicker,
Chairman.
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
Washington, DC.

Hon. Maria Cantwell,
Ranking Member,
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
Washington, DC.

Dear Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member Cantwell:

    The GPS Innovation Alliance (``GPSIA'') thanks the U.S. Senate 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation (``Committee'') for 
its continued work overseeing the Federal Communications Commission 
(``FCC'' or ``Commission''), including at the Committee's June 24, 2020 
hearing.\1\ During the hearing, FCC Chairman Pai and the other 
Commissioners discussed, among other things, the Ligado Order, which 
granted applications submitted by Ligado Networks LLC (``Ligado'') to 
modify its Mobile Satellite Service authorizations to be able to deploy 
a nationwide terrestrial wireless network in so-called ``L-Band'' 
spectrum.\2\ While the GPSIA appreciates the Chairman and 
Commissioners' comments on efforts to expand the deployment of 
broadband services, we believe certain statements made in response to 
questions asked by Committee members require additional clarification. 
The GPSIA therefore submits this letter to correct the record.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ See Oversight of the Federal Communications Commission Before 
the Senate Comm. on Commerce, Science, and Transp., 106th Cong. (2020) 
(``FCC Oversight Hearing'').
    \2\ See LightSquared Technical Working Group Report, et al., Order 
and Authorization, 35 FCC Rcd 3772 (2020) (``Ligado Order''). The L-
band frequency bands covered by the Ligado Order are 1526-1536 MHz, 
1627.5-1637.5 MHz, and 1646.5-1656.5 MHz.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 1 dB Standard is the Appropriate Metric to Guard Against Harmful 
        Interference to GPS Navigation and Timing Services
    Chairman Pai testified that the FCC has ``never embraced'' the 1 dB 
standard and that the National Telecommunications and Information 
Administration (``NTIA'') itself has rejected that standard.\3\ 
Chairman Pai further stated that utilizing the 1 dB standard would 
``wipe out wireless communications as we know it.'' Both statements are 
inaccurate, and they highlight the fundamental flaws in the Ligado 
Order--the Commission's failure to adequately consider the unique 
characteristics of Global Positioning System (``GPS'') devices, timing 
and navigation devices that are fundamentally different from 
communications devices, and to adopt an interference standard that is 
appropriate for GPS. Since GPS is different, adopting an appropriate 
interference standard for GPS does not mean the FCC would be required 
to extend that same standard to communications systems. The FCC can, 
and should, adopt interference standards that are appropriate for each 
individual service and has done so in the past. Its failure to do so 
here threatens the 900 million GPS receivers in use in the United 
States\4\ and the critical activities and systems that depend on them.

    \3\ FCC Oversight Hearing (statement of Chairman Pai); see also 
Letter from the Honorable Ajit Pai, Chairman, FCC, to the Honorable 
Chris Coons, Mike Lee, Edward J. Markey, Ron Johnson, Brian Schatz, 
John Thune, and Mark Warner at 4 (dated June 12, 2020). The 1 dB 
standard measures whether a new service causes a 1 dB degradation in a 
receiver's Carrier-to-Noise Power Density Ratio (``C/N0'') 
or a 25 percent increase in the noise floor. See, e.g., Letter from J. 
David Grossman, Executive Director, GPS Innovation Alliance, to Marlene 
H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, IB Docket Nos. 11-109 and 12-340, at 2

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    First, the FCC has, in fact, utilized the 1 dB standard, including 
in cases involving GPS.\5\ We note that just two months prior to the 
adoption of the Ligado decision, the Commission applied the 1 dB 
standard in order to protect C-band earth stations from terrestrial 
broadband operations in the adjacent band.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ See, e.g., Revision of Part 15 of the Commission's Rules 
Regarding Ultra-Wideband Transmission Systems, Memorandum Opinion and 
Order, 18 FCC Rcd 3857,  12, 14 (2003) (utilizing the 1 dB standard 
when the FCC established emission levels for ultra-wideband 
transmission systems); Amendment of Parts 73 and 74 of the Commission's 
Rules to Establish Rules for Digital Low Power Television, Television 
Translator, and Television Booster Stations and to Amend Rules for 
Digital Class A Television Stations, Report and Order, 19 FCC Rcd 
19331,  230 (2004) (using the 1 dB standard to establish rules to 
limit the emissions of low-power television stations into the spectrum 
band used by GPS); Allocations and Service Rules for the 71-76 GHz, 81-
86 GHz, and 92-95 GHz Bands, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 20 FCC Rcd 
4889,  23 (2005) (modifying the interference protection criteria for 
existing digital and analog facilities by adopting a 1 dB standard).
    \6\ See Expanding Flexible Use in the 3.7-4.2 GHz Band, Report and 
Order, Order Proposing Modification, 35 FCC Rcd 2343, 366-89 (2020) 
(``C-Band Order''); id.  382 (``We find that a protection criteria of 
I/N = -6 dB is appropriate for TT&C links, as we did for the FSS earth 
stations described above. The 3.7 GHz Service licensee must ensure that 
the aggregated power from its operations will meet an I/N of -6 dB as 
received by the TT&C earth station.''); id.  388 (``To protect TT&C 
earth stations from adjacent channel interference due to out-of-band 
emissions, we set the same interference protection criteria of -6 dB I/
N ratio.''). An interference-to-noise (``I/N'') ratio of -6 dB is 
equivalent to a 1 dB rise in the noise floor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Second, the FCC has previously distinguished, as it did not do 
here, between different types of services, adopting an interference 
standard that is appropriate based on the circumstances. For example, 
in repurposing ``H Block'' spectrum for mobile communications services, 
the Commission adopted a less restrictive 3 dB standard to protect 
mobile communications systems. But in doing so, the Commission 
acknowledged that the ``1 dB desensitization is most commonly used as 
an interference protection criterion for noise-limited receiver 
systems.'' \7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ Service Rules for Advanced Wireless Services H Block--
Implementing Section 6401 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job 
Creation Act of 2012 Related to the 1915-1920 MHz and 1995-2000 MHz 
Bands, Report and Order, 28 FCC Rcd 9483,  144 (2013). In that same 
decision, the FCC also referenced an Interference Protection Criteria 
Technical Report released by NTIA on the 1 dB standard, demonstrating 
that both the FCC and NTIA have relied on or utilized the 1 dB 
standard. See id.  144, n.440.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    GPS receivers are precisely the type of ``noise-limited receiver 
systems'' that the Commission recognized that the 1 dB standard should 
be used to protect. As the FCC has explained, ``noise limited'' systems 
and services include receivers that are expected to continue to operate 
even when they receive very weak signals and are limited by the 
presence of radiofrequency noise that is expected to be present at the 
same level as the desired signal.\8\ A 1 dB adverse change, which 
represents a 25 percent increase in noise, is a sizable impact on such 
systems. Unlike typical wireless communications systems, which operate 
at high power relative to satellite signals and operate above the noise 
floor, wide bandwidth, spread spectrum GPS signals are below the 
thermal noise floor when they are received.\9\ Indeed, GPS satellites 
transmit with no more power than a 50-watt light bulb, and signals 
arrive on earth with a power of less than a millionth of a billionth of 
a watt.\10\ Therefore, GPS receivers are inherently vulnerable to high-
powered transmissions in closely adjacent spectrum.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    That is why, while GPS receivers are designed to withstand 
adjacent-band transmissions that are substantially stronger than GPS 
signals, they can be ``overloaded'' by high-powered mobile broadband 
transmissions in adjacent frequencies.\11\ Even lower power mobile 
telephone networks operating in adjacent spectrum will be a billion 
times stronger than a GPS signal when a GPS receiver is in close 
proximity (e.g., 100 meters). Given the ubiquity of GPS devices in the 
United States, high-powered operations in adjacent spectrum are likely 
to seriously degrade and/or disrupt the operation of GPS devices on an 
ongoing basis. For these reasons, continued adherence to the 1 dB 
standard is critical.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ See Letter from Russell H. Fox, Counsel for Trimble Navigation 
Limited, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, IB Docket Nos. 11-109 
and 12-340, Attachment at 3 (filed June 19, 2015).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The consequences of disruption to GPS receivers and the devices and 
systems in which they are embedded are also fundamentally different 
from the consequences of interference to communications devices. Mobile 
phone users can observe the results of interference in dropped calls or 
poor call quality. In contrast, the disruption or degradation to the 
accuracy and integrity of a GPS receiver is not readily detectable by 
the end user, producing an inaccurate readout of position or time, 
which can have untold consequences. The device or system will continue 
to operate with a degraded position or timing output, but will perform 
worse as a result.\12\ In extreme cases of interference, when a GPS 
receiver ``loses lock'' on available GPS satellites altogether, the 
user is left with no means of determining location until the 
interference is abated--another potentially catastrophic outcome when 
GPS is relied upon for critical life-saving services.

    \12\ See GPSIA NTIA Spectrum Management Plan Comments at 7-8; 
Letter from M. Anne Swanson, Counsel to Garmin, to Ms. Marlene H. 
Dortch, Secretary, FCC, IB Docket Nos. 11-109 and 12-340, at Attachment 
2 at 4-5 (filed Oct. 27, 2015).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Wireless operators have technology and expertise to monitor 
operations and design their networks to minimize interference to 
wireless operators in adjacent spectrum. Wireless systems can also take 
advantage of adaptive power control, forward error correction, retry 
capability, and other systems that allow mobile devices and the network 
to dynamically adjust to reduce the impact of interference. It is 
therefore appropriate to adopt more permissive standards of what 
constitutes harmful interference protection for communications systems, 
as the FCC did when it adopted a 3 dB standard for the H Block.
    Because interference to positioning, navigation, and timing 
(``PNT'') services, as opposed to communication services, creates 
different kinds of risks, the Commission's rules, like those of the 
International Telecommunications Union, defines interference to each 
differently. In particular, the Commission's rules define harmful 
interference as that ``which endangers the functioning of a 
radionavigation service or of other safety services or [which] 
seriously degrades, obstructs, or repeatedly interrupts a 
radiocommunication service operating in accordance with Radio 
Regulations.'' \13\ The Ligado Order mistakenly applies the 
Commission's own ``seriously degrades, obstructs, or repeatedly 
interrupts'' standard for radiocommunications to GPS--a radionavigation 
service. A 1 dB standard serves as the appropriate level to protect GPS 
receivers against severe impact to performance and guard against 
harmful interference. The international standard metric for protecting 
the functioning of a radionavigation service and guarding against it 
from being endangered is the 1 dB standard,\14\ and it should have been 
employed in the Ligado Order.

Trimble, IB Docket Nos. 11-109 and 12-340, at 5 (filed June 8, 2020)

different for communications and navigation systems).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The difference in standards is critical. The Commission's rules and 
ITU Radio Regulations are specifically written to ensure that a pilot, 
farmer, boat owner, or first responder is not required to demonstrate 
after the fact, once the harm has already occurred, that the operation 
of his or her GPS-dependent device has been ``seriously degraded'' or 
``repeatedly interrupted.'' The FCC should have determined whether 
Ligado's operations ``endanger[] the functioning'' of GPS devices, and 
the Commission's failure to do this was a fundamental error that 
requires correction.
Ligado's Spectrum Does Nothing to Advance U.S. Leadership in the Race 
        to 5G
    When asked if Ligado's spectrum is necessary to win the race to 5G, 
Chairman Pai responded by listing other bands to which the FCC faced 
resistance in the process of converting them to full mobile wireless 
use.\15\ He claimed that if the Commission had listened to all those 
objections, there would be no 5G spectrum. Chairman Pai seems to be 
suggesting that all objections to converting spectrum to 5G are equally 
invalid. His statements do not account for different spectrum band 
characteristics and, because of how they are used, their 
vulnerabilities to interference. The distinction between communications 
and navigation systems discussed above should have required a different 
evaluative approach alongside the laudable goal of pursuing 5G 
deployment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \15\ FCC Oversight Hearing (statement of Chairman Pai).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Notably, Chairman Pai did not say that L-Band spectrum is necessary 
to win the race to 5G. Indeed, nothing about L-Band spectrum makes it 
even relevant--let alone critical--to winning the race to 5G. As 
Senator Duckworth correctly pointed out, until the Ligado Order, the 
FCC did not consider this spectrum to be 5G-suitable.\16\ And the 5G 
FAST Plan introduced by Chairman Pai includes no mention of the L-Band 
as being necessary or relevant to winning the 5G race or maintaining 
U.S. leadership on 5G.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \16\ FCC Oversight Hearing (questions of Sen. Tammy Duckworth).
    \17\ See 5G FAST Plan, FCC, https://www.fcc.gov/5G (aiming to free 
up another 2.75 gigahertz of spectrum in the 26 GHz and 42 GHz bands 
and over 800 megahertz of mid-band spectrum for 5G services, but making 
no mention of L-band spectrum).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    That is not surprising. First, Ligado's spectrum is merely a sliver 
of spectrum. As compared to the large contiguous swaths of spectrum the 
FCC has made available to support 5G services,\18\ Ligado's network 
would operate only on spectrum blocks of 10 non-contiguous megahertz--
well below what is needed for 5G. Second, Ligado's spectrum is not 
internationally harmonized. Neither Europe, China, or Japan, nor any 
other major country has identified the L-Band for 5G. As GSMA has 
emphasized, international harmonization is important to ``make the best 
possible mobile services available for everyone and everything.'' \19\ 
Third, Ligado's proposed network would only be able to offer limited 
Internet of Things (``IoT'') services. Specifically, Ligado proposes to 
provide an Industrial IoT service, primarily delivered over custom 
private networks to specific geographic areas for limited vehicular and 
utility operations. Not only is this not a 5G service offering, but 
similar services are already being provided by wireless service 
providers on an ancillary basis, often using the guard band of spectrum 
otherwise used for wireless broadband.\20\ Ligado's service is simply 
not a 5G service.

Dear Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Schatz:

    As a coalition of transportation industry stakeholders comprised of 
state, city, and county departments of transportation, public 
transportation, automakers, vehicle suppliers, trucking, transportation 
safety groups, law enforcement, first responders, auto insurers, bus 
associations, infrastructure equipment suppliers, bicyclists, and 
pedestrians, among others that care deeply about transportation safety, 
we write to express significant concern with efforts underway at the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to reallocate spectrum in the 
5.9 GHz band away from transportation safety. Reducing the amount of 
spectrum available to Reducing the amount of spectrum available to 
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology undermines our shared interest 
in reducing the number of traffic fatalities and injuries that occur 
each year on U.S. roadways, improving motor vehicle safety, and 
improving the operational performance of roadways by reducing 
congestion across the transportation system. Such a decision would also 
harm U.S. global competitiveness with respect to next-generation 
automotive safety technologies. We ask you to use the Committee's 
authority over the FCC to direct the Commission to reconsider the 
approach in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that reallocates 
spectrum within the 5.9 GHz band for unlicensed uses.
    As you know, the 5.9 GHz spectrum band is currently reserved for 
intelligent transportation systems. Commonly referred to as V2X 
technologies, these systems allow vehicles to communicate with other 
vehicles, infrastructure, law enforcement, and bicycle and pedestrian 
road users to avoid crashes, enhance safety, improve transportation 
efficiency, and reduce air pollution. The National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration (NHTSA) predicts that the safety applications 
enabled by V2X technologies could eliminate or mitigate the severity of 
up to 80 percent of non-impaired crashes, significantly reducing the 
nearly 37,000 lives lost and three million injuries that occur on U.S. 
roadways each year.\1\ In addition, 70 percent of crashes involving 
commercial trucks could be mitigated by V2X technologies according the 
NHTSA. V2X technologies will provide real economic savings as well by 
significantly reducing the more than $800 billion in annual costs 
associated with crashes on American roads.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Furthermore, these technologies are uniquely capable of reducing 
traffic congestion through prioritized traffic signal timing, truck 
platooning, and crash reduction, reducing travel time and delays for 
commuters and commerce alike, delays that cost the Nation more than 
$166 billion annually according to the U.S. Department of 
Transportation (USDOT).\3\ V2X pedestrian detection systems will better 
protect vulnerable road users, which encompasses a broad set of road 
users--people walking, children being pushed in strollers, people using 
wheelchairs or other mobility devices, passengers embarking and 
disembarking buses and trains, and people riding bicycles and scooters. 
Preserving the spectrum for V2X would provide greater benefit for the 
American people than reallocating the spectrum for unlicensed devices.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    USDOT and public and private sector transportation stakeholders 
have worked together to bring this technology to the U.S. market. 
Billions of dollars--including at least $2 billion in public funding 
from federal, state, and local governments--have been invested in the 
development and deployment of V2X technology.\4\ The result of U.S. 
innovation and investment in V2X is now shown through existing and 
planned deployments around the country. At least 30 states--from 
Michigan to Pennsylvania to Ohio to Florida--have invested in building 
out intelligent infrastructure using V2X technology. Two of the 
country's largest automakers, General Motors and Ford Motor Company, 
have deployed or announced plans to deploy these technologies in 
vehicles in the U.S. market, and, recently, the Alliance for Automotive 
Innovation announced a commitment to deploy at least five million V2X 
devices in vehicles and roadway infrastructure over the next five 
years.\5\

    \5\ Letter from John Bozella, President and CEO of the Alliance for 
Automotive Innovation, to the Honorable Elaine Chao, Secretary of 
Transportation, and the Honorable Ajit Pai, Chairman of the FCC (April 
23, 2020). Available at: https://www.autosinnovate.org/wp-content/

Letter-April-23-2020-ID-1567.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Even as automakers and infrastructure owners and operators move 
forward with deploying these technologies, V2X innovation continues. In 
recent years, we have seen the development of new applications and 
novel use cases that will further advance transportation safety, 
particularly related to advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and 
automated vehicles (AVs). V2X technologies enable applications that 
cannot be performed by un-connected AVs, such as communicating with 
vehicles that are out of line-of-sight, providing road hazard warnings 
from roadside infrastructure, and allowing AVs to coordinate actions 
rather than making decisions individually. V2X complements AV sensors 
by providing information that is more precise, over longer ranges, and 
in non-line-of-sight conditions.
    Unfortunately, since 2013, the FCC has been threatening to 
repurpose spectrum away from these cutting-edge transportation safety 
technologies and has now released a NPRM to reduce the spectrum that is 
available to V2X technologies.\6\ The FCC's proposed rule would 
reallocate the majority of the 5.9 GHz band away from transportation 
safety. Numerous technical assessments related to the FCC's proposal, 
including preliminary assessments released by USDOT, show that out-of-
channel interference from unlicensed devices operating in adjacent 
bands would be likely to make the spectrum reserved for transportation 
safety communications unusable for such purposes.\7\ This interference 
would delay or block safety-critical messages where split-second action 
is required to avert a crash.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The United States has led the world in creating V2X technologies 
and in developing the standards that enable and support V2X 
technologies. The FCC's proposal would cede American leadership as 
countries around the world are building out their V2X networks. There 
is no doubt that, if implemented, the NPRM would undercut the public 
and private investments that have been made in the United States, 
stifle further innovation, and challenge American global 
competitiveness. This approach is in direct conflict with efforts 
underway in other parts of the world. At precisely the same time that 
other countries are reiterating their commitment to V2X technologies 
and, in many cases, looking to increase the amount of spectrum that is 
available to support V2X technologies, the FCC is poised to take action 
that would all but ensure that these technologies would not realize 
their full potential in the United States.
    The comments and reply comments submitted to the FCC in response to 
the NPRM overwhelmingly opposed repurposing spectrum away from 
transportation safety. In fact, more than 85 percent of the commenters 
opposed the FCC's proposal, including state and city departments of 
transportation, automakers, vehicle suppliers, technology companies, 
law enforcement, first responders, safety advocates, engineers, 
telecommunications companies, the drone industry, and many others. 
These groups asked the FCC to heed the warnings of USDOT that this plan 
would not allow sufficient spectrum for V2X to function, threatening 
the significant safety benefits this technology provides.
    We are representative of a broad and diverse group of stakeholders 
that strongly support preserving the 5.9 GHz safety spectrum band for 
transportation safety. We ask you to use the Committee's authority over 
the FCC to direct the Commission to reconsider the approach in the NPRM 
that reallocates spectrum within the 5.9 GHz band for unlicensed uses. 
Use of your authority at this critical juncture could save thousands of 
American lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. We look 
forward to working with you to ensure that the safety, economic, 
congestion mitigation, environmental, and efficiency benefits that V2X 
technologies can provide are realized in the United States.

Hon. Brian Schatz,
Ranking Member,
Committee on Commerce, Science and Technology,
Subcommittee on Communications, Innovation and the Internet,

Washington, DC.

Dear Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Schatz,

    On behalf of over 300 leading aerospace and defense (A&D) 
manufacturers and suppliers, the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) 
is pleased to file this statement for the record in response to the 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation's Subcommittee 
on Communications, Technology, Innovation and the Internet's hearing, 
``The State of U.S. Spectrum Policy.'' We thank the Committee for 
holding this important hearing and for its leadership on issues 
affecting the aerospace and defense (A&D) industry, including spectrum 
policy.
    For more than 100 years, our members have been on the cutting edge 
of innovation and are leading the development of emerging technologies 
that will revolutionize the way in which goods and people are moved, 
services are performed, and people connect.
    Spectrum is the life blood of our industry and enables virtually 
everything that our members design, manufacture, operate, and launch. 
For that reason, our industry represents some of the largest users of 
the FCC's experimental licensing regimes which is one of the critical 
enablers to U.S. technology development and leadership. As these 
products move from development to reality, access to spectrum becomes 
critical.
    That access comes through ensuring continuity of existing 
allocations for harmonized equipment designs as well as meeting the 
need for additional spectrum for new capabilities, such as urban air 
mobility, through efficient and timely rulemaking processes. This 
process is critical to the success of the A&D industry and our Nation's 
economy. However, it is not optimized for the current and future 
economy and advancing U.S. global leadership across all sectors of our 
economy.
    In 1934, Congress established the Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC) as an independent federal agency to manage our nation's non-
federal spectrum allocations.\1\ This was followed by the establishment 
of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration 
(NTIA) in 1978 which serves as the president's principal adviser on 
spectrum policies and is viewed as the voice of Federal spectrum 
stakeholders.\2\ For many years, these two agencies have worked 
together to help enable spectrum access for all stakeholders through a 
formal memorandum of understanding (MOU), last updated in 2007, and 
other processes. One such process is the Interdepartment Radio Advisory 
Committee (IRAC) which allows for the Federal government agencies, 
including the FCC, to directly weigh in with the NTIA on their spectrum 
priorities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ See, Communications Act of 1934
    \2\ See, https://www.ntia.doc.gov/book-page/national-
telecommunications-and-information-ad
ministration#::text=The%20NTIA%20of%20the%20U.S.,102538%2C%20106%20Stat
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This structure has, in part, led to the U.S. being the leader in 
wireless communications technologies like 4G LTE, as well as enabling 
other sectors of the economy, like the A&D industry, to thrive. 
However, the bifurcated structure has also enabled a system that is not 
optimized for today's spectrum sharing economy and where spectrum 
dependence is regularly an administration priority. Spectrum is a 
scarce resource that is only becoming more congested, which requires 
the FCC and Government to look at creating new allocations, repurposing 
existing bands, or, more importantly, developing new sharing 
arrangements to continue the U.S. technology leadership, beyond 5G and 
next generation A&D capabilities.
    Today's spectrum realities also highlight the difficulties with our 
Nation's spectrum governance structure. As we look to enable greater 
spectrum sharing, we must develop creative sharing solutions that 
enable growth and innovation by both existing and new users of 
spectrum.
    This evolution toward sharing presents an opportunity to look at 
how to optimize spectrum management to better enable sharing amongst 
all stakeholders--commercial industries and federal/state/local users. 
Fortunately, there is a recognition of the need to ask questions about 
U.S. spectrum policy, as evidence by this hearing. Discussion is also 
underway in the Commerce Spectrum Management Advisory Committee 
(CSMAC), which serves as a formal advisory body to the Assistant 
Secretary for Communications and Information at NTIA on spectrum 
issues,\3\ which will soon publish a report titled, ``Report on the 
Presidential Memorandum on Developing a Sustainable Spectrum Strategy 
for America's Future: Governance.'' \4\ This report sought to answer a 
similar question as the hearing today-is U.S. spectrum management 
optimized for the implementation of a 21st century national spectrum 
strategy? \5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ See, https://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/csmac

20.pdf--this was a presentation of a draft report.
    \5\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The group's preliminary finding was that ``our country's current 
approach for managing the use of spectrum is no longer effectively 
serving the needs of the managing the use of spectrum is no longer 
effectively serving the needs of the entire stakeholder community and 
would benefit from reform.'' \6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ iBid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The need to optimize the spectrum governance model is further 
evident in the increasing and visible fractures in our decades-old 
bifurcated model--where statutory priorities differ between our two 
regulators, and unilateral decision-making authority exists in one. It 
will be important to ensure that a future spectrum governance model is 
designed to address all U.S. priorities, particularly as we seek to 
increase spectrum efficiency for all users through true spectrum 
sharing. Issues with the current process were evident in recent FCC 
decisions such as 24 GHz, C Band, 5.9 GHz, and Ligado.
    U.S. global leadership depends upon the system being optimized and 
incorporating the full suite of economic and security interests into 
the decisions on spectrum governance. We no longer have the long-
enjoyed luxury of exclusive spectrum lanes, let alone users. For 
example, future Advanced Air Mobility technologies like Unmanned 
Aircraft Systems and Urban Air Mobility platforms will, in some cases, 
need additional spectrum to safely operate with the required 
reliability and safety that aviation demands, particularly when we 
consider either passengers or large cargo delivery capabilities. While 
unlicensed spectrum or mobile wireless are options for platforms at low 
altitudes in urban/suburban areas, it will not serve the myriad of use 
cases that will enable the billions of dollars and tens of thousands of 
jobs that these technologies will provide.\7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This hearing today presents the first legislative opportunity to 
take a fresh look at the future of our Nation's spectrum governance 
model. AIA believes that this opportunity is long overdue and 
encourages the Subcommittee to take the next step of engaging with the 
broader industry stakeholder community that depends on access to 
spectrum. We would encourage a survey among the broader industry 
stakeholder community for their views on the importance of and ideas 
for future spectrum governance. It is critical that we take a step back 
and go beyond the traditional entities whose businesses are directly 
regulated by the FCC.
    We look forward to working with this Committee and all relevant 
spectrum stakeholders as this conversation continues and leads to a 
system that enables the U.S. to remain the global leader in all sectors 
of the spectrum economy.

    Question. You mentioned in your testimony the need to increase 
collaboration between industry and the Federal government to identify 
sections of spectrum currently in use by the government that could be 
reallocated. You also mentioned a process by which this transfer of 
information could happen securely, to protect sensitive government 
information. Please describe the process by which industry and the 
government could securely work together to identify spectrum for 
reallocation, especially the steps taken to prevent sensitive 
government information from being exposed.
    Answer. Collaboration and information-sharing between government 
agencies and the private sector can be extremely beneficial to both 
sides, particularly as the government seeks to share its spectrum with 
commercial networks, or relocate government systems from one band to 
another. To assist in these efforts, the private sector subject matter 
experts (SMEs) require information about Federal systems and 
operations, much of which is classified. Yet there is no program 
designed to grant security clearances to qualified private sector SMEs 
for the purpose of sharing classified information about government 
spectrum operations. One model that the Department of Defense and other 
agencies might consider is the Department of Homeland Security's 
Private Sector Clearance Program for Critical Infrastructure. Under 
this program, DHS oversees a rigorous vetting process to grant security 
clearances to qualified representatives from the private sector, for 
the purpose of enhancing public-private collaboration when it comes to 
identifying and mitigating risks to critical infrastructure. A similar 
program dedicated to granting clearances to private sector spectrum 
SMEs--if well managed--could accelerate the deployment of commercial 
wireless networks while ensuring the robustness and security of 
government systems and operations.

    Question 1. The physics associated with the 12 GHz band present 
some interesting opportunities for expanding mid-band mobile broadband 
services in our 5G infrastructure. Compared to CBRS or C-band, this 
frequency appears to have some additional rain fade; however, the data 
rates should be comparably excellent. Furthermore, there are fewer 
hurdles to bring this band into the mobile broadband market. Can you 
comment on the overall benefits the 12 GHz band can bring to the 
wireless market?
    Answer. CTIA shares your focus on the need for the U.S. to allocate 
more spectrum for licensed wireless terrestrial use. Although the U.S. 
will be auctioning 350 MHz of mid-band spectrum this year alone, other 
nations remain ahead in the deployment of critical spectrum resources. 
The 12 GHz band could thus be an extremely valuable component in the 
buildout of 5G networks and beyond. The 12 GHz band offers an 
attractive mix of high capacity, capable of transmitting large amounts 
of data at high speeds similar to high-band spectrum, while also having 
some better geographic range than spectrum above 20 GHz. Operators have 
been hard at work deploying 5G in high band spectrum at 28 GHz, 37-30 
GHz, and other frequencies taking into account rain fade 
considerations. Allocating a portion of the 12 GHz band to mobile 
broadband would require accommodation of the incumbent licensed users 
of the band. Those incumbents include providers of satellite television 
services who count numerous rural residents among their subscribers. 
CTIA is working with members in an effort to develop a consensus 
approach to a potential 12 GHz auction, putting that band to its 
highest and best use while also generating billions of dollars in 
auction revenues.

    Question 2. The next several years will be transformative for the 
U.S. for 5G infrastructure, with the CBRS auction currently ongoing and 
the C-band auction scheduled for December. An intriguing approach to 
how this network could be defined is by using the Open Radio Access 
Network (ORAN) specification, which is garnering attention in foreign 
markets but has been slow to be adopted in the US. Can each of you 
comment on the implications of whiteboxing our global 5G 
infrastructure? What are the economic implications if the U.S. doesn't 
adopt the ORAN specification in its mobile broadband infrastructure?
    Answer. CTIA supports efforts to increase U.S. competitiveness in 
the wireless networking space, and Open RAN can play an important role 
in that regard. The addition of open interfaces to network components 
will provide carriers with added flexibility in the design of their 
network architecture, while promoting greater competition among 
infrastructure vendors, and potentially reducing total cost of 
ownership. The introduction and scaling of Open RAN solutions will take 
time, given the complexity of wireless networks; however, the U.S. is 
well positioned to take advantage of the emergence of Open RAN, with 
its potential to contribute significantly to U.S. job creation and 
economic productivity.

    Question 1. The physics associated with the 12 GHz band present 
some interesting opportunities for expanding mid-band mobile broadband 
services in our 5G infrastructure. Compared to CBRS or C-band, this 
frequency appears to have some additional rain fade; however, the data 
rates should be comparably excellent. Furthermore, there are fewer 
hurdles to bring this band into the mobile broadband market. Can you 
comment on the overall benefits the 12 GHz band can bring to the 
wireless market?
    Answer. The 12 GHz band presents interesting wireless 
opportunities. Currently allocated for the Multichannel Video 
Distribution and Data Service (MVDDS) and Direct Broadcast Service 
(DBS), the band presents 500 MHz of spectrum that could be used for 5G. 
The physics of the band mean that due to propagation loss, signals will 
travel about a quarter less as far as the CBRS or C-band. However, 
signals will travel about twice as far as the lowest of the millimeter 
wave bands. That puts the band in a good place to be used for general 
mobile broadband services. Data rates would be related to the size of 
the channels, but with 500 MHz of spectrum available, channels could be 
sufficiently wide to support high-speed data.
    The band is used by several licensees in the MVDDS and DBS, so 
sharing must be considered. Since the band is the subject of a 
rulemaking request at the FCC (RM-11768), it would make sense for the 
FCC to conduct a rulemaking to study the whether the band can be used 
for mobile broadband (either 5G or a subsequent technology) and any 
related comments on sharing. CommScope would make the observation that 
typically bandwidth requirements increase for each successive 
generation of mobile broadband service. Policymakers and regulators 
should consider increasing bandwidth requirements versus the amount of 
spectrum available in the allocation to accommodate the number of 
expected licensees.

    Question 2. The next several years will be transformative for the 
U.S. for 5G infrastructure, with the CBRS auction currently ongoing and 
the C-band auction scheduled for December. An intriguing approach to 
how this network could be defined is by using the Open Radio Access 
Network (ORAN) specification, which is garnering attention in foreign 
markets but has been slow to be adopted in the U.S. Can each of you 
comment on the implications of whiteboxing our global 5G 
infrastructure? What are the economic implications if the U.S. doesn't 
adopt the ORAN specification in its mobile broadband infrastructure?
    Answer. This is a very important question in regard to U.S. 
leadership and competitiveness in next generation wireless technologies 
and networks.
    CommScope is closely following two initiatives--(1) mobile network 
function virtualization (i.e., VRAN, ``whiteboxing'', etc..) and (2) 
Open Radio Access Network standardization (e.g., Open RAN, O-RAN, 
etc..).
    Mobile network function virtualization will leverage advancements 
in software abstraction of formerly hardware functions, computing 
power, and cloud systems to transform proprietary hardware in the 
mobile network core and RAN into software components running on 
commodity computing platforms (typically based on x86 processor 
technology). This follows the broader technology trend of the 
virtualization and `cloudification' of many functions that were 
formerly handled by vendor proprietary hardware, as evidenced in the 
storage, web serving, and enterprise networking sectors.
    Open RAN is an initiative to standardize the communications 
interfaces between the various components in the Radio Access Network 
over existing commoditized technologies such as fiber, ethernet, and 
TCP/IP. Historically, mobile networks have been deployed using 
compatible radio network equipment from a single vendor as a ``closed'' 
proprietary solution, making it virtually impossible to `mix and match' 
components from various vendors. Because Open RAN implements 
standardized interfaces that are truly open and interoperable, and 
components can be tested and certified to comply with those interfaces, 
it breaks this vendor lock in, enabling innovation, creating a more 
competitive market, and accelerating deployments. Similarly to mobile 
network function virtualization, O-RAN follows the broader industry 
trend to standardize communications services (e.g., IBM's Systems 
Network Architecture [SNA], voice, video, etc. . .) over globally 
common interfaces.
    CommScope is a leader in the Open RAN ecosystem through our 
internal research and development activities and our external 
participation in standardization efforts via groups like the O-RAN 
Alliance and advocacy organizations like the Open RAN Policy Coalition.
    The United States has long been the global leader in network 
function virtualization and `democratizing' proprietary interfaces by 
implementing open standards over common interfaces. In fact, the U.S. 
led all of the historical examples of virtualization and open 
interfaces listed above. Given this, it would be logical and natural 
for the U.S. to lead as these macro industry trends are applied to the 
mobile industry in the areas of VRAN and O-RAN. CommScope supports the 
various government initiatives and legislative proposals to allocate 
Federal funds for Open RAN research and development and that would 
encourage Federal agencies to foster the deployment of open and 
interoperable 5G networks in their various pilot programs and 
procurement guidelines. This type of government support would 
accelerate domestic development, helping to secure future U.S. 
leadership in these key technology fields.
    While none of the leading incumbent mobile equipment vendors are 
U.S. companies, O-RAN enables the possibility of building the overall 
mobile network from a combination of companies, many being U.S. firms. 
Rather than having a monolithic solution from a foreign vendor as was 
done in the past, standardization plus virtualization enables a litany 
of U.S. companies to work in both competition and collaboration to 
provide a more dynamic, faster, and best-in-breed network to support 
all of America's Mobile Telecommunications needs.
    In terms of the economic impacts, both VRAN and O-RAN seek to lower 
the costs for mobile network operators by transforming proprietary 
components and communications services and allowing them to run on 
common computing platforms and network technologies. O-RAN also allows 
for network operators to `mix and match' RAN components from various 
vendors, creating a more competitive market for each aspect of the RAN. 
American operators would be at a competitive disadvantage if they were 
not able to access and leverage VRAN and O-RAN developments. 
Fortunately, U.S. mobile operators are helping lead much of the 
industry activity and we believe they fully intend to realize the 
economic benefits of VRAN and O-RAN.

RAN, please see our filing in response to NTIA's Request for Public 
Comment on The National Strategy to Secure 5G Implementation Plan.

  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Marsha Blackburn to 
                          Roslyn Layton, Ph.D.
    Please note that these answers reflect my personal views and should 
not necessarily be construed as the opinion of any organization with 
which I am affiliated.

    Question 1. The physics associated with the 12 GHz band present 
some interesting opportunities for expanding mid-band mobile broadband 
services in our 5G infrastructure. Compared to CBRS or C-band, this 
frequency appears to have some additional rain fade; however, the data 
rates should be comparably excellent. Furthermore, there are fewer 
hurdles to bring this band into the mobile broadband market. Can you 
comment on the overall benefits the 12 GHz band can bring to the 
wireless market?
    Answer. The effort to find more spectrum for 5G is commendable. The 
hearing and my written testimony detailed the problems of 
administrative allocation of spectrum. There was a consensus among 
panelists that many Federal agencies are reluctant to make efficient 
use of frequencies for which they do not pay, to share them with other 
parties with more valuable uses, or even to disclose how they use the 
spectrum. All these problems can be attributed to the lack of pricing 
for Federal spectrum.
    To avoid the problems of administrative allocation noted in the 
hearing, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should make any 
new spectrum available in the 12 GHz on a licensed basis with 
competitive bidding. It should avoid unlicensed use of the band. 
Unlicensed spectrum regimes offer little means to allocate the spectrum 
rationally among users, introduce security risk and vulnerabilities 
into networks, and provide no means to recover the spectrum. Two 
articles are attached to this response which describe these issues.
    Aside from the limitations of the 12 GHz band for terrestrial 5G 
service (notably rain fade and limited ability to deliver long distance 
coverage), the band could ostensibly support more coverage in cities. 
In general, having more spectrum for 5G would support greater 
deployment of services, market entry by firms, increased specialization 
by firms, and increased value for consumers. While the 12 GHz 
opportunity is promising, it should not detract form the more important 
goal of enabling greater spectrum in lower parts of the mid-band with 
frequencies which offers a better mix of physical properties for 5G. 
Nor should the 12 GHz effort delay Congress from its critical task to 
improve accountability from Federal spectrum holders.

    Question 2. The next several years will be transformative for the 
U.S. for 5G infrastructure, with the CBRS auction currently ongoing and 
the C-band auction scheduled for December. An intriguing approach to 
how this network could be defined is by using the Open Radio Access 
Network (ORAN) specification, which is garnering attention in foreign 
markets but has been slow to be adopted in the U.S. Can each of you 
comment on the implications of whiteboxing our global 5G 
infrastructure? What are the economic implications if the U.S. doesn't 
adopt the ORAN specification in its mobile broadband infrastructure?
    Answer. Thank you for the exciting question. As a starting point, 
it is important for such inquiries to be technology neutral. Ideally 
the telecommunications industry should choose the technology that best 
serves their needs and objectives. I don't fear that the U.S. won't be 
part of the ORAN development. Indeed, it is American companies that are 
driving much of ORAN's development.\1\ My assessment of ORAN is based 
on 5G commercial development, and the fact that U.S. operators have 
been among the first to launch 5G. Given the hype around ORAN, it is 
wise to take a step back and take a critical view.

Commission on September 14, 2020. https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Understanding ORAN must account for the product lifecycle: idea, 
concept, development, and implementation. It's a long process from 
conceiving the idea of ORAN to turning it into a marketable product/
service which is then implemented on tens of thousands of mobile sites 
serving millions of customers. Moreover, U.S. carriers must maintain a 
high standard of coverage and operability to satisfy their customers. 
Similarly, mobile operators place great demands on their equipment 
suppliers. Just as NASA has a set of software quality requirements to 
send people into space, mobile operators have requirements and 
standards for software. Mobile subscribers expect their mobile phones 
to function in the same way every time, just life turning on the faucet 
or flicking the light switch.
    Some refer to ORAN as a substitute for native 3GPP solutions. 
However ORAN is not a substitute for 3GPP. ORAN is dependent on 3GPP 
and the patents that are the foundation of 5G.\2\ ORAN will likely 
coexist with native 3GPP RAN which today serves more than 8 billion 
mobile subscribers globally. To date, there have been 92 5G networks 
launched in the world.\3\ All of these are built on native 3GPP RAN; 
none are built on ORAN. The first operator to deploy ORAN will likely 
be Japan's Rakuten,\4\ a virtual greenfield operator which is not 
comparable to NTT Dokomo, the country's leading mobile provider. As 
such, native RAN solutions still have significant value and should not 
be dismissed. Indeed, the prevailing market for 3GPP is staggering.\5\

    All the first mover nations in 5G, including the US, are in the 
same position regarding 3GPP. The U.S. and South Korea lead in 5G in 
part because they use proven 3GPP solutions deployed for hundreds of 
millions, if not billions, of mobile subscribers. It is best to 
question U.S. mobile operators as to when ORAN is expected to be 
viable.
    Network security is important. Thankfully the U.S. restricts Huawei 
and related malicious Chinese in-formation technology equipment. As 
such, the U.S. has flexibility to experiment with ORAN solutions while 
maintaining security. However, deploying ORAN in Europe could be 
disastrous because many Huawei elements remain in mobile networks.\6\ 
As such the benefits of ORAN will be undermined by Huawei products and 
services which will be able to infiltrate the network through ORAN's 
open inter-faces.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The first order of business is to rid the world's networks of 
malicious Chinese equipment. Only then should operators start 
experimenting with ORAN. Otherwise, combining ORAN with Huawei, ZTE, or 
other Chinese network products could increase risk and vulnerabilities.
    ORAN is not by inherently more secure that native 3GPP, nor is open 
source technology more secure than proprietary technology. Indeed, ORAN 
will require additional security measures that are not addressed fully 
by 3GPP SA3 security standards, since ORAN introduces additional open 
interfaces and functions (such as LLS, SMO, near Real Time RIC, etc.) 
that are not part of the 3GPP standard. Moreover, the ORAN Alliance 
only recently formed a security task force, within O-RAN WG1 
(Architecture) to address the new associated security risks with 
ORAN.\7\ This means that security issues will take some time to 
address. Combining open source RAN with Chinese equipment poses a 
serious security risk.

       The U.S. Restricts Huawei In 5G, But Wi-Fi Is Up For Grabs

      By Roslyn Layton, Senior Contributor, Forbes, April 23, 2020

 https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2020/04/23/the-us-restricts-
          huawei-in-5g-but-wi-fi-is-up-for-grabs/#26915d83551e

    The U.S. and other countries restrict Huawei in 5G (even providing 
funding to ``rip and replace'' the equipment), but this does not stop 
the company from deploying in Wi-Fi networks. Once a device is deployed 
in Wi-Fi, it can't be forcibly recalled for security reasons. Huawei 
touts its role in Wi-Fi 6, considered the future-proofing strategy for 
the Wi-Fi industry. The Austin-based Wi-Fi Alliance recently honored 
top tier member Huawei for its leadership in the Wi-Fi 
CERTIFIEDTM program, allowing its products to be embossed 
with the Wi-Fi CERTIFIEDTM seal. The advocacy group recently 
congratulated Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai for 
the April 23 vote to designate 1200 MHz of the 6 GHz band for 
unlicensed use, quintupling the spectrum for technologies such as Wi-
Fi. The Wi-Fi Alliance did not respond to a request for comment.
    Unlicensed spectrum is celebrated for being free and open to 
anyone, and the Wi-Fi industry plans to deploy hundreds of millions of 
connected devices in the 6 GHz band. However, providers of critical 
infrastructure services in public safety, communications, rail, 
electric, gas, water, and wastewater are not enthused; they operate 
some 100,000 fixed service links in the band, over which the 
forthcoming Wi-Fi devices would be deployed. Failing to forestall the 
FCC's proposal which they say threatens the safety of their networks, 
they urged the FCC to adopt greater controls to mitigate interference, 
as regulating power levels for transmission is insufficient to protect 
existing networks. For example, many homes have backyards that border a 
railroad, and the signal for their Wi-Fi router, even at low power, can 
be observed outside. This means that a device need not have a security 
vulnerability to threaten critical infrastructure, to say nothing of 
deliberate security vulnerabilities.
    The FCC may have denied China Mobile license to operate in the U.S. 
for national security concerns, but its daughter company China Mobile 
Group Device Co. can access U.S. networks through America's standards 
organizations and its Wi-Fi networks. Indeed China's influence of 
international standards organizations to circumvent national security 
policy is well established area of policy research.
    Among the 800 members of the Wi-Fi Alliance are many firms owned 
and affiliated with the Chinese government and listed in the U.S. 
National Vulnerabilities Database, restricting their use in the Federal 
government. These member firms include Wi-Fi Alliance honoree Lenovo, 
world's leading maker of laptops, ZTE Corporation (network equipment), 
Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co., Ltd. (surveillance cameras), 
Lexmark (printers), and TCL Corporation (smart TVs). My report Stealing 
from the States: China's Power Play in IT Contracts documents how such 
companies have evaded rules against their deployment in U.S. Federal 
networks to embed themselves at the state level, home to treasure 
troves of sensitive data for elections, financial reports, and personal 
information but which have fewer security controls.
    The bipartisan sanction of Huawei by Congress, the Department of 
Commerce, the FCC and other agencies may have stopped Huawei from 
Federal networks and 5G, but it doesn't necessarily stop Huawei in 
state government, private companies, and Wi-Fi networks. Indeed, many 
vulnerable technologies proliferate where there are not explicit 
restrictions. Moreover, Federal bans do not stop Chinese government-
owned companies from playing important roles in U.S. standard setting 
and IT advocacy organizations. Following placement on the Entity List, 
Huawei was ejected but then quickly rein-stated as a member at the Wi-
Fi Alliance, IEEE, SD Association, and JEDEC. Some claim there is no 
choice but to accept Chinese government owned vendors in standards 
groups, but China's endgame is clear: It has long been architecting an 
alternative version of the Internet which does not include American 
technology nor any pretense of coexistence.
    While the value of Wi-Fi is undisputed, the FCC's proposal would 
give restricted Chinese firms free rein to a wide swath of spectrum 
overlaying critical infrastructure for utilities, transportation and 
public safety. Moreover, the U.S. is behind on licensing mid-band 
spectrum where malicious vendors and de-vices can be excluded. China 
has some 500 MHz of mid-band spectrum in play for 5G, the U.S. hasn't 
even concluded its mid-band 5G auctions, itself a national security 
issue raised by two dozen security and defense experts. If we don't 
want Huawei in 5G, it shouldn't be in Wi-Fi either.

            FCC Should Use Its New Tools to Make Wi-Fi Safer

    The FCC should step up security by restricting risky vendors on 
unlicensed Wi-Fi spectrum and make more licensed spectrum available for 
                      5G wireless communications.

 By Roslyn Layton and David Witkowski. Above Ground Level. August 2020

                               wifi-safer

    The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has shown that broadband 
networks are essential. People have used wireless networks to work, 
learn and obtain health care services. However, they face greater 
security risks when accessing enterprise applications and sensitive 
data with unsecured networks and devices, as may be the case when they 
are working at home.
    The most common cyberattacks--data breaches, phishing and hacking--
are driven primarily by organized crime and state-sponsored actors for 
financial and espionage reasons. Cyber attackers are looking for 
valuable personal and financial information, intellectual property and 
proprietary product information, corporate account information about 
key employees and customers, and corporate network access. Individuals 
having endured extensive isolation during the pandemic are further 
vulnerable to phishing and social engineering attacks together with 
hacking when they increasingly multitask on a mobile device connected 
to Wi-Fi, a usable but architecturally unsecured network.
    In the past year, the FCC adopted significant national security 
policy, including a prohibition of using Universal Service Funds to 
purchase equipment or services from companies posing threats to 
communications networks or supply chains. This move was designed in 
part to restrict Huawei and ZTE from 5G networks, which already have 
better security because of a superior architecture. The FCC has not 
stated a similar plan for Wi-Fi, even though Wi-Fi is teeming with 
vulnerable vendors, and Huawei itself touts its leadership role in Wi-
Fi 6. Now armed with a super-charged presidential executive order to 
deny and revoke licenses and applications from risky vendors, the FCC 
should use its authority to make Wi-Fi safer.
Why 5G Has Better Security Than Wi-Fi
    Wi-Fi is ideal for local-area networks and enterprise deployments 
in office buildings. 4G LTE and 5G NR, on the other hand, are suited to 
wide-area networks and infrastructure deployments that require 
connection management to ensure reliability and predictably for 
millions of users at once. These differences reflect the economic 
choices inherent in licensed and unlicensed spectrum. 5G providers, 
having spent billions of dollars to purchase the right to transmit data 
across the airwaves, steward the resource wisely and safely to ensure a 
good experience for their customers. Unlicensed spectrum, free and open 
to anyone, has few incentives to be stewarded well. As such, those who 
value security, pay for it.
    Where other users are known, security is less important, and 
devices can manage their own connections. Users accessing an open, no-
password-required Wi-Fi access point take enormous risks. As Wi-Fi 
access points grow, it is prudent to adopt rigid security protocols 
where the network manages the device connection. A connection-oriented 
or connection-managed protocol (WiMAX, 4G LTE, 5G NR) requires that an 
end-to-end data link between the sending node and receiver node be 
established both before and while data is transferred.
    Connection-managed protocols have better reliability, 
predictability and security because the encryption key exchange is end-
to-end and must be completed before data is transferred. In a 
connection-less protocol, like Wi-Fi, data is sent from the sending 
node to the network without requiring an end-to-end link. Users can 
employ security technologies to protect data from being lost, misrouted 
or intercepted, but many threats are managed more efficiently at higher 
levels in the network. Although forthcoming Wi-Fi 6 equipment offers 
better security, it will take time for every Wi-Fi router to be 
upgraded, leaving Wi-Fi users at risk in the meantime. With 5G, 
however, users have built-in advanced security, regardless of the 
device.
    Connection-managed wireless networks such as 4G/5G allow mobility, 
moving quickly across a large space while keeping a secure, consistent 
connection. This mobility is provided by a hand-off system that shifts 
the connection to the best possible tower or site. On unlicensed, 
connectionless systems, the client will remain attached to the access 
point until the connection is so poor that it fails. Although some 
solutions try to make Wi-Fi better, they typically require upfront 
investment, which can add cost to the proffered free-and-open business 
model.
    4G/5G offers patented features to ensure a high-quality experience: 
centralized authentication (intelligence in the device ensures network 
authentication), network rules for security of data transmission; 
protocols to avoid congestion, spectrum/channel steering, and resource 
allocation management. 5G security is not perfect--attacks using 
cellular site equipment (either repurposed or deliberately built to 
allow state-sponsored surveillance) could harm subscribers, but hacking 
the firmware of a consumer-grade Wi-Fi access point is a lot easier--
and far less expensive--than constructing a cellular site.
Restricting Risky Vendors Can Improve Wi-Fi
    Although improving the architecture of Wi-Fi is difficult, Wi-Fi 
security can be immediately improved by restricting risky vendors and 
equipment from networks. The FCC has been dogged about restricting 
malicious Chinese government-owned technology on 5G. Consumers deserve 
the same security on Wi-Fi, and the FCC should hold Wi-Fi providers to 
the same standards as required on 5G.
    Historically, any device could use unlicensed networks, provided it 
complied with the FCC's regulated power levels, a certification that 
comes with the FCC sticker on the back of the device. However, the new 
``Team Telecom'' order allows the FCC to deny or revoke device 
applications for security reasons.
    U.S. policy has clamped down on Huawei for good reason, but it is 
hardly the only Chinese government-owned technology firm to worry 
about. American Wi-Fi networks and standards organizations are teeming 
with such companies, including Lenovo, Panda Electronics, Skyworth, 
SVA, TCL, Xiaomi, BOE, Changhong, Haier, Hisense, Konka and DJI. The 
security threats of backdoors and viruses from devices from these 
companies are considerable. Moreover, they all operate under China's 
draconian Internet and espionage laws that assert China's sovereignty 
over the Internet and its authority to collect any data on any Chinese-
made device anywhere in the world. These companies are restricted on 
Federal government networks, but their equipment presents the same 
vulnerabilities on commercial networks and on state government 
networks, where they are currently unrestricted.
Mid-band Spectrum Improves 5G Security
    By opening the 6-GHz band, the FCC quintupled the spectrum for 
unlicensed technologies: some 1200 megahertz will be available for Wi-
Fi. Not only does the FCC need to step up security by restricting risky 
vendors on unlicensed spectrum, it needs to make more licensed spectrum 
available for 5G, a more secure technology than Wi-Fi. China has some 
500 megahertz of mid-band spectrum in use today and has deployed some 
160,000 5G base-stations in 50 cities. The United States must wait 
until December for an auction of 250 megahertz and yet another year 
thereafter to repack the spectrum, a slow pace which is itself a 
national security concern. As COVID-19 has shown, we needed networks 
yesterday. At the least, the FCC has more tools to use to improve 
security and should use them to make Wi-Fi safer.
                                 ______
                                 
    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Jerry Moran to 
                           Michael Calabrese
    Question 1. The FCC took significant action in designating 1200 
megahertz for unlicensed use in the 6 gigahertz band this spring. How 
do you expect this development to impact at-home connectivity 
opportunities in rural communities, especially as it relates to 
telehealth needs?
    Answer. Senator Moran, thank you for your timely question. My 
organization and our entire Public Interest Spectrum Coalition (PISC) 
expect the FCC's world-leading decision in April to authorize 
unlicensed use across the entire 6 GHz band to yield perhaps its 
greatest benefits in rural communities, including for telehealth. 
Rural, small town, Tribal and historically marginalized communities are 
most likely to find themselves on the losing side of the digital 
divide. We expect the next generation of Wi-Fi--Wi-Fi 6--to be as big a 
leap forward in affordable connectivity as mobile 5G networks will be 
compared to 4G. Thanks to the wide, contiguous channels of unlicensed 
spectrum the FCC made available in the 6 GHz band, Wi-Fi 6 will 
accelerate the availability and affordability of 5G-quality 
applications and services in rural communities that will not have 
access to mobile carrier 5G for many, many years.
    Unlicensed access to 1200 megahertz at 6 GHz will have a 
disproportionately positive impact on rural communities and telehealth 
for several reasons:
    First, while 5G networks may not reach rural, small town or even 
many exurban communities for many years, smaller and local providers of 
high-capacity fixed wireless broadband that rely primarily on 
unlicensed and coordinated sharing of unused spectrum capacity can more 
rapidly extend high-capacity and more affordable fixed broadband access 
to these underserved areas. More mid-band unlicensed (at 5.9 and 6 GHz) 
and shared spectrum (the new Citizens Broadband Radio Service) will 
serve as the public infrastructure that enables high-capacity broadband 
in less densely-populated areas. The 850 megahertz in the 6 GHz band 
that will be accessible to WISPs and other providers at full (standard) 
Wi-Fi power limits allows for as many as five gigabit-fast, 160-
megahertz channels of capacity for outdoor use. Capital costs to deploy 
fixed point-to-multipoint (P2MP) wireless connections using this 
unlicensed spectrum are a fraction--about one-seventh the cost--of 
fiber and are still able to provide high-throughput broadband 
service.\1\ Fixed wireless service relying on unlicensed spectrum is 
also far more cost-effective per gigabyte for this purpose than mobile 
networks relying on more limited licensed spectrum. In addition, 
anywhere a high-capacity fixed service is available, Wi-Fi 6 can 
provide the same consumer benefits as licensed 5G and more affordably. 
This means more homes and small businesses will be connected for 
telehealth and other services at far higher speeds and more affordably.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ See The Carmel Group, Ready for Takeoff: Broadband Wireless 
Access Providers Prepare to Soar with Fixed Wireless, at 12, Fig. 6 
(2017).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Second, all 1200 megahertz of the 6 GHz band are available for use 
indoors at a lower power level and without the additional cost or 
complexity of being controlled by an Automated Frequency Control (AFC) 
system, as standard power outdoor Wi-Fi must be. (The AFCs required for 
outdoor use of 6 GHz are geolocation databases that operate very much 
like the TV White Space databases do today.) Indoors, all 1200 
megahertz will be fully available, enabling multi-gigabit throughput on 
Wi-Fi routers that will have access to seven channels as wide as 160-
megahertz. Wi-Fi is the workhorse of the Internet because low-cost, 
off-the-shelf routers and devices can easily and affordably offer 
access to unlicensed spectrum that provides high-capacity connectivity 
in homes, at work, at school, in libraries, retailers and healthcare 
facility. With access to 6 GHz, all of the bandwidth that a home can 
access on its fixed broadband service (whether wireline or wireless) 
can be distributed and useful to every device, including health care 
monitors and sensors that could be using a variety of unlicensed 
technologies.
    Third, Wi-Fi plays an increasingly important role in connecting 
healthcare, education, manufacturing, technologies. Hospitals, clinics 
and doctors will increasingly be able to rely on telehealth as both 
they and their patients acquire affordable, high-capacity wireless 
connectivity. More broadly, IoT and other high-capacity, local-area 
networks--most of which will be indoors and connect everything--are 
likely to make unlicensed spectrum an even more critical part of a 
truly robust 5G ecosystem. Hospitals are a perfect example of 
congested, high traffic, constantly changing environments that would 
benefit from Wi-Fi 6. As more smart devices are adopted at hospitals 
and the use of data analysis in healthcare grows, the need for large, 
contiguous bands of unlicensed spectrum for indoor use is absolutely 
vital. Farms and ranches will also have far more capacity for smart 
agriculture and related productivity gains. Any farm, campus or 
enterprise will be able to customize a very high-capacity Wi-Fi 6 
network to meet its needs without relying on a 5G mobile carrier 
service that might not even be available.
    Overall, this new unlicensed capacity will make telehealth 
applications and services far faster, more reliable and more 
affordable.

    Question 2. Your testimony described OTI's support for flexible use 
rights issued to Multichannel Video Distribution and Data Service 
(MVDDS) licensees in the 12 gigahertz band. Can you describe to this 
Subcommittee how this suggested policy change would benefit rural 
communities through increased broadband connectivity while protecting 
incumbent operations?
    Answer. The 12 GHz Band provides an opportunity to adopt a sharing 
framework in this valuable but underutilized band that greatly expands 
the availability of spectrum for both fixed and mobile broadband 
deployments with mid-band propagation characteristics significantly 
better than the millimeter wave bands at 24 GHz and beyond. 
Specifically, my organization and many other parties support 
consideration of the proposal made in a petition for rulemaking filed 
by the MVDDS Coalition.\2\ Given this Commission's commitment to 
opening additional mid-band spectrum for 5G services, including low-
power unlicensed uses for Wi-Fi 6, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to 
consider the best way to achieve more intensive and efficient use of 
this 500 megahertz at 12.2-12.7 GHz is in the public interest.

Use of the 12.2-12.7 GHz Band for Two-Way Mobile Broadband Service, RM-

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition to considering two-way and more flexible use rights for 
MVDDS licensees, the NPRM should request comment on the authorization 
of coordinated, shared use of the band for high-capacity fixed wireless 
services on an unlicensed or secondary basis. Opening access to unused 
12 GHz spectrum can provide spectrum-as-infrastructure to fixed 
wireless ISPs and other broadband network providers in underserved 
rural, tribal and less densely populated communities. Coordinated 
sharing of unused portions of the 12 GHz band could be particularly 
beneficial for rural, tribal and other underserved communities. A 
recent study by BroadbandNow Research found that 42 million Americans 
lack access to wireline or fixed wireless broadband, nearly 13 percent 
of the population, with a disproportionate share in rural and small 
town communities.\3\ Surveys by the Pew Research Center found that only 
63 percent of rural Americans said they having broadband at home, 
compared to 79 percent of suburban Americans and 75 percent of 
Americans living in urban areas.\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    These less-densely-populated areas tend to have lower rates of 
broadband adoption due to the high costs for both backhaul and last 
mile buildout. This makes fixed wireless access, both P2P and P2MP, 
particularly potent in narrowing the connectivity gap. Rural 
communities will especially benefit from the higher capacity throughput 
that wireless ISPs could potentially offer with local access to this 
spectrum. As the current COVID-19 crisis has made painfully clear, 
adequate and affordable broadband access has become critical for 
accessing education, healthcare, government services and the modern 
workplace.
    A use-it-or-share-it opportunity at 12 GHz will help expand 
affordable broadband services in rural, tribal and other communities 
where there is a limited economic incentive for a national or regional 
carrier to offer service, but still a real economic need for the 
community. Rather than leave as much as 500 megahertz in the band 
fallow in underserved rural and other less-densely-populated areas, the 
Commission should consider a ``use it or share it'' approach that 
allows at least secondary, coordinated access for fixed broadband uses 
(both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint). Conceptually, this 
approach is similar to the Commission's very recent and successful 
authorization of coordinated access to unused spectrum in the lower 45 
megahertz of the 5.9 GHz band in the face of the Covid crisis.\5\ 
Wireless Internet service providers (WISPs) are making coordinated, 
secondary use of the spectrum to boost the capacity of their fixed 
wireless deployments that rely on the adjacent unlicensed spectrum band 
(U-NII-3) to make affordable broadband service available in mostly 
rural, small town and historically underserved areas.\6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A coordinated sharing process at 12 GHz could operate very much 
like the new Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), which authorizes 
secondary and temporary access to the licensed portion of the band (70 
megahertz) in any local area where post-auction Priority Access 
licensees have not yet deployed or commenced service. By similarly 
relying on a coordination database, this proven approach can ensure 
that unused spectrum is put to use in rural and other hard-to-serve 
areas without any risk of interference or any negative impact 
whatsoever on the primary licensees.

  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Marsha Blackburn to 
                           Michael Calabrese
    Question 1. The physics associated with the 12 GHz band present 
some interesting opportunities for expanding mid-band mobile broadband 
services in our 5G infrastructure. Compared to CBRS or C-band, this 
frequency appears to have some additional rain fade; however, the data 
rates should be comparably excellent. Furthermore, there are fewer 
hurdles to bring this band into the mobile broadband market. Can you 
comment on the overall benefits the 12 GHz band can bring to the 
wireless market?
    Answer. Senator Blackburn, thank you for your question and for 
recognizing the tremendous potential for expanded use of the 12 GHz 
band. As I noted in my response to Senator Moran's question concerning 
the potential benefits of the 12 GHz band to rural communities (above), 
my organization and many other parties support consideration of the 
proposal made in a petition for rulemaking filed by the MVDDS 
Coalition.\7\ By adding the 12 GHz Band to the FCC's 5G FAST Plan, the 
Commission can make an additional 500 megahertz of contiguous spectrum 
available for two-way fixed and mobile 5G wireless broadband services, 
while protecting incumbent satellite uses (including satellite 
broadband) from harmful interference. This will promote competition, 
innovation and improve services to underserved communities.

    When the Commission adopted the current MVDDS rules in 2000,\8\ 
long before smartphones or online video services, we lived in a very 
different world. At that time, DBS was a fast-growing service and 
spectrum sharing based on interference mitigation technologies did not 
exist. Today, DBS is rapidly losing customers, while broadband 
satellite providers using a different technology from DBS are poised to 
enter the market. Fixed wireless using both licensed and unlicensed 
spectrum has become an important component in closing the rural digital 
divide. And competition in the mobile wireless sector has gone from 
highly competitive in 2000 to highly concentrated in 2020.

    The 12 GHz Band provides an opportunity to adopt a sharing 
framework that greatly expands the availability of spectrum for both 
fixed and mobile broadband deployments with mid-band propagation 
characteristics significantly better than the millimeter wave bands at 
24 GHz and beyond. As we told the FCC in a May letter joined by the 
Competitive Carriers Association and other diverse stakeholders, ``if 
two-way, 5G wireless broadband services were allowed, initial use cases 
would include fixed broadband, mobile 5G services to handsets and 
street-level Internet of Things opportunities.'' \9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ See Letter of Competitive Carrier Association, et al. to 
Chairman Ajit Pai, RM-11768 (filed May 26, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    More flexible spectrum use rights for existing licensees can also 
promote competition in mobile broadband. As a consequence of the T-
Mobile acquisition of Sprint, American consumers are now limited to a 
choice of three national carriers. As a consequence, it is imperative 
that the Commission ensure that DISH has access to sufficient spectrum 
to compete aggressively with the incumbent providers. More flexible use 
rules for MVDDS licensees will enhance DISH's chances of success. We 
believe maximizing the number of potential 5G providers through a 12 
GHz rulemaking offer the best chance for rural Americans to benefit 
from more broadband access and competition.

    Question 2. The next several years will be transformative for the 
U.S. for 5G infrastructure, with the CBRS auction currently ongoing and 
the C-band auction scheduled for December. An intriguing approach to 
how this network could be defined is by using the Open Radio Access 
Network (ORAN) specification, which is garnering attention in foreign 
markets but has been slow to be adopted in the US. Can each of you 
comment on the implications of whiteboxing our global 5G 
infrastructure? What are the economic implications if the U.S. doesn't 
adopt the ORAN specification in its mobile broadband infrastructure?
    Answer. Senator Blackburn, thank you for your question about an 
Open RAN specification. I cannot answer in detail, since I haven't 
researched or focused on this important issue. My organization, the 
Open Technology Institute, generally supports open and interoperable 
technology platforms, which we believe promote innovation, competition 
and ultimately lower prices for consumers. ORAN has the potential 
`break the RAN stack' and thereby stimulate new competition. Opening 
the stack to competing vendors, including American companies, can spur 
competition and downward pricing pressure for the various components of 
5G network infrastructure. Virtualized RAN deployments can 
substantially reduce the capital and operating costs of 5G networks, 
yet the RAN ecosystem remains closed and dominated by non-American 
companies using proprietary interfaces.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ See, e.g., ``Leveraging O-RAN to Stimulate U.S. Investment and 
Leadership in Wireless Technology,'' DISH, white paper (March 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If the U.S. does not adopt an ORAN specification, these market 
entrants and U.S. companies will continue to be blocked by foreign-
based companies that are able to force mobile network providers to 
purchase integrated 5G network infrastructure based on proprietary 
interfaces. Without an ORAN specification, a few large and foreign-
based wireless infrastructure providers will have tremendous market 
power and dominate the market. This would likely result in higher 
prices and less innovation compared to a market premised on open and 
interoperable components. The absence of an ORAN specification could 
have security implications as well, particularly if the pressures of 
limited choice and competition pushes network providers into a reliance 
on infrastructure sold by companies that are not free from state 
influence and control.
