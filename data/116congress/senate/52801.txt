                      WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 2019

                                       U.S. Senate,
        Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room 
SH-216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Roger Wicker, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Wicker [presiding], Sullivan, Capito, 
Young, Thune, Fischer, Gardner, Lee, Scott, Moran, Blackburn 
[presiding], Cantwell, Schatz, Peters, Tester, Markey, Baldwin, 
Blumenthal, Udall, and Rosen.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ROGER WICKER, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI

    The Chairman. Good morning. Today the Committee convenes to 
discuss legislative proposals to protect the privacy of 
consumer data, both offline and online in the United States. I 
welcome our distinguished panel of witnesses and thank them for 
appearing. They include: Ms. Maureen Ohlhausen, former Acting 
Chair of the Federal Trade Commission and Co-Chair of the 21st 
Century Privacy Coalition; Ms. Julie Brill, former Commissioner 
of the Federal Trade Commission; Ms. Nuala O'Connor, Senior 
Vice President and Chief Counsel of Digital Citizenship at 
Walmart; Ms. Michelle Richardson, Director of Privacy and Data 
at the Center for Democracy and Technology; and Ms. Laura Moy, 
Executive Director and Associate Professor of Law at the 
Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology.
    For the past year, members of this Committee have worked to 
develop a strong national privacy law that would provide 
baseline data protection for all Americans. Given the 2018 
implementation of the European Union's General Data Protection 
Regulation, the passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act, 
and near daily reports of data breaches and misuse, it is clear 
that Congress needs to act now to provide stronger and more 
meaningful data protections to consumers and address the 
privacy risks that threaten the prosperity of the Nation's 
digital economy. The input of a large number of stakeholders, 
including consumer advocacy groups, State and local 
governments, nonprofits, and academia have all been successful 
in this effort.
    Representatives from the private industry such as retailers 
and convenient stores, software, internet, and cloud service 
providers, technology companies, small businesses, and several 
other job creators in my home state of Mississippi and across 
the country have also provided thoughtful insights to this 
Committee. Throughout this process, we have heard many ideas 
about how best to protect data from misuse and unwanted 
collecting and processing. These ideas involve providing all 
Americans with more transparency, choice, and control over 
their data, as well as ways to keep businesses more accountable 
to consumers when they seek to use their data for other 
purposes.
    We have heard proposals about how to strengthen the Federal 
Trade Commission to ensure it has the tools and resources it 
needs to take swift action against bad actors in the 
marketplace and effectively respond to changes in potentially 
harmful technology. That is the FTC's role as the primary 
enforcement authority over consumer data privacy. An important 
element of this conversation has been how to achieve each of 
these goals while preserving the economic and social benefits 
of data. These benefits not only drive increased productivity, 
convenience, and cost savings, but they also spur job creation 
and promote U.S. leadership and technology developments.
    Ultimately, to foster continued innovation among our 
countries entrepreneurs and job creators, Americans need to 
maintain trust and confidence that their data will be protected 
and secure. Today marks another step forward in the Committee's 
efforts to create a national data privacy law. Some of the 
proposals we will cover today seek to establish consumers' 
rights and protections over their data in a manner that would 
provide certainty and clear workable rules of the road for 
businesses in all 50 states.
    This hearing provides an opportunity to hear from expert 
witnesses on ways to refine these proposals. That should 
include a discussion on the benefits of creating a strong 
national and pre-emptive privacy law that provides consumers 
with certainty that they will have the same set of meaningful 
data protections no matter where they are in the United States.
    Second, the best way to make sure consumers know about and 
have a right to opt out of the data collection practices of 
businesses they deal with. Number three, how requirements on 
businesses to limit the amount of data they collect and retain 
about consumers may impact product development and innovation, 
or what content a consumer is able to view or engage with 
online. Four, how heightened protections over more sensitive 
personal data, such as information about financial records and 
biometric information, would help prevent fraud, identity 
theft, and security breaches, and whether companies should be 
required to provide similar heightened protections to non-
sensitive data.
    Fifth, the merits of creating accountability measures for 
businesses including requirements to conduct privacy, impact 
assessments when creating new products and services, and 
designating data privacy and security officers to oversee 
ongoing data practices. Six, how empowering consumers with 
rights over their data and providing additional resources and 
authorities to the FTC would help strengthen data protections 
and confidence in the safety and security of the Internet 
marketplace.
    And finally, what enforcement mechanisms are the best way 
to ensure requirements in a law and see that privacy 
protections are enforced. Let me take a moment to acknowledge 
and thank members of this Committee, up and down the dais on 
both sides for excellent and thoughtful work during the past 
year and even before, and who continue as members of the Senate 
to actively work on legislation that seek to protect consumer 
privacy.
    I appreciate the efforts of each and every member and the 
valuable contributions the members are making to this important 
work. And thank you again to our witnesses. This should be a 
very important hearing and I am delighted now to recognize the 
Ranking Member, Senator Cantwell, for her opening remarks.

               STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is safe to 
say this is the other hearing this morning. And not only that, 
I am glad to see that all the witnesses testifying today are 
people I know for sure care about privacy. I think it is 
historic that it is an all-women panel this morning, but again, 
thanks to each and every one of you trying to advocate on these 
important issues. Cyber Monday was just a couple of days ago, 
and it set a record, $9 billion in sales and an increase of 19 
percent over last year.
    For the first time ever, it was $3 billion that came from 
people using smartphones to make those purchases. So during the 
peak hours between 11 p.m. and midnight--I am sorry, 11 p.m. 
Eastern time and midnight--consumers spent an average of $11 
million every minute. So it is not just Cyber Monday that is 
reminding us, because we all know that we buy groceries, fill 
prescriptions, pay bills, connect to home devices, to the 
internet, apply for loans, stay connected with family and 
friends, and social media, and so much more of our lives are 
lived online. Which means more information is shared, which 
means deeply, sometimes personal information is shared. And 
that information can be used to be targeted or to exclude 
consumers, to be sold, or even worse, it can be stolen. And 
that is why we are here today, because we want to protect 
consumers' privacy rights.
    We believe to do that you need strong enforcement and 
mechanisms to make sure that those rights are protected. The 
risks that we face online are real. We know that companies 
today are using ads that might be only for the purposes of 
targeting what they think is a correct population, young men to 
work in software, but others can see those ads as 
discriminatory, or not making themselves available to what 
information is out there on a job.
    Google's Nest camera was involved in an alarming situation 
where a hacker was able to hack into a couple's baby camera, 
shouting obscenities before they were able to disable the 
device. A woman in Portland, Oregon had a private conversation 
sent by an Alexa device when it went rogue to a colleague.
    And then, of course, there is the huge issue of marketed 
and stolen information, Social Security numbers, login 
information, drivers' licenses, passports, all now going in the 
thousands of dollars on the dark web, and in fact in 2005 more 
than 11 billion consumers have had their information breached. 
Just last month, the Washington State Attorney General released 
a report saying that the number of data breaches in my state 
has increased nearly 20 percent in one year. So that is a 
matter of our digital footprints continuing to be under attack. 
It is Congress' job to make sure that Americans are protected 
and that this information, that is an ever-connected, ever-
evolving world, is protected.
    And that is why a few weeks ago Senators Schumer, Brown, 
Murray, Feinstein, and myself joined together to talk about a 
privacy framework, legislation from all of those committees, 
that we think would be important for the milestones, the 
privacy goals that should be met. Last week, Senators Schatz, 
Klobuchar, Markey, and myself also introduced the Consumer 
Online Privacy Act that guarantees new rights to consumers and 
strong enforcement. As the Chairman mentioned, many of our 
colleagues here, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Thune, Senator 
Blackburn, and others have been involved in these privacy 
discussions as well, and we welcome everyone's input on how we 
move forward.
    The important things that we think should be there is that 
you should have the right to make sure your data is not sold. 
That you have the right to make sure your data is deleted. That 
you have the right to make sure that you are not discriminated 
against with data, and the right to just have plain old 
transparency about what is being done on a website.
    All of these things are tangible and meaningful for 
consumers. I say they just need to be clear as a bell so that 
people understand what their rights are and so they know how to 
enforce them. So today we are here to hear from a group of 
witnesses who are going to tell us how those issues might be 
interpreted for the future. But I think the Director of the New 
York Law School's Innovation Center, Ari Ezra Waldman, recently 
made a statement that really resonated with me. He said, ``we 
can pass any laws we want, but if there is no way to enforce 
them, then what is the point?''
    So today we also have to talk about enforcement, because 
enforcement is going to be the key to making sure that privacy 
rights are actually upheld, that the consumer is truly 
protected. And if we want the consumers to have that 
protection, then we also have to make sure that there is 
accountability, that there are whistleblowers, that there are 
cases against abuses that might happen. If your privacy rights 
are violated, you need to be first able to find out about it, 
and then you need to have the power to do something about it as 
well, and that is why we think our strong legislation does so. 
But I also want to say how much this issue is evolving.
    Today's Seattle Times features a very large announcement by 
the Knight Foundation and the University of Washington, and 
Washington State University, on this issue of the public being 
fooled by online manipulation, whether that is news stories, 
digital forgeries, or fakes. They want to focus on developing 
research and tools to resist misinformation, promote an 
informed society, and strengthen the discourse and discussion 
in America. I am so proud that these institutions are taking on 
this challenge, and that this kind of national initiative in 
our legislation, with NIST, the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, at the Department of Commerce, would be 
empowered in the legislation we introduce to help with this 
effort.
    While we are here today to talk about just some basics in 
digital hygiene online, the future though is this, the 
challenges we face as more and more misinformation, forgery, 
things we can't even detect whether they are true or not, will 
continue to appear online. We need to build a strong system 
today in a Federal framework that will help us continue to grow 
for the ever-changing technology future. That is what we are 
dedicated to.
    I look forward to hearing the witnesses today and seeing 
how we can move forward in this important policy area. Thank 
you, Mr. Chairman--and if I could also just enter into the 
record, a list of organizations, a letter sent to you and I, of 
organizations sponsoring, supporting privacy legislation. And I 
will just mention a few others if I could, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Without objection. That will be entered into 
the record at this point.

                               Consumer Bankers Association
                                   Washington, DC, December 3, 2019

Hon. Roger Wicker, Chairman,
U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
Washington, DC.

Hon. Maria Cantwell, Ranking Member,
U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
Washington, DC.

Dear Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member Cantwell:

    On behalf of the Consumer Bankers Association (CBA), I write to 
share our views on a national data privacy framework for the Senate 
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee's hearing entitled 
``Examining Legislative Proposals to Protect Consumer Data Privacy.'' 
CBA is the voice of the retail banking industry whose products and 
services provide access to credit for consumers and small businesses. 
Our members operate in all 50 states, serve more than 150 million 
Americans, and collectively hold two-thirds of the country's total 
depository assets.
The State of Data Privacy
    Unfortunately, data breaches have become all too prevalent in our 
digital world and consumers are rightly concerned about the manner in 
which their personal information is collected, shared, protected and 
stored. In 2018 alone, the number of data breaches in the U.S. totaled 
more than 1,200 according to the Identity Theft Resource Center. No 
industry was immune from breaches in 2018: business sector (46 
percent), healthcare/medical industry (29 percent), banking/credit/
financial industry (11 percent), government/military (8 percent), and 
the education sector (6 percent). When taking a closer look at the data 
it is clear, the non-financial business sector, which is not subject to 
national data security requirements, was responsible for the 
overwhelming majority (93 percent) of the personal records compromised. 
In addition to breaches, concerns regarding the misuse of customer data 
warrant a review of industry practices and the scope of Federal privacy 
laws and regulations, e.g., Cambridge Analytica gained access to 
private information on more than 50 million Facebook users.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    CBA members take seriously their responsibility to clearly explain 
how consumer data is used and to safeguard it against improper use and 
criminals' nearly constant attempts to steal it. Since the passage of 
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) in 1999, financial institutions have 
been required to provide their customers a clear privacy notice 
detailing information collection and sharing practices, which includes 
an opt-out for the sharing of information with non-affiliated third 
parties. This notice is provided at the beginning of the customer 
relationship and annually thereafter. GLBA and subsequent regulations 
also require banks to have in place data security protocols to 
safeguard sensitive consumer information and to report to Federal 
authorities and affected consumers when a breach occurs. Banks are 
examined by their prudential regulators on these standards and if found 
to be non-compliant may face fines or other penalties.
    The low breach-rate of personally identifiable information (PII) at 
financial institutions compared to other sectors can be attributed to 
the common-sense safeguards required by GLBA and the industry's 
commitment to security. As a result, consumers trust financial 
institutions more than any other type of organization to keep their 
financial information secure, according to an August 2017 poll by 
Morning Consult.
Consumer Privacy
    Consumers should have reasonable control concerning the collection, 
use and sharing of personal data. However, we caution against national 
privacy legislation that may inhibit banks' ability to fulfill their 
contractual obligations to consumers. Compared to other industries, 
banks are subject to more stringent rules and lead in protecting 
consumers' PII and their privacy.
    Pursuant to the GLBA, banks are required to protect the security 
and confidentiality of consumer records and information, and the law 
also requires banks to disclose their privacy practices and limits 
sharing PII with nonaffiliated third parties. Any Federal privacy law 
must consider the GLBA and other existing Federal privacy laws and 
preempt the growing patchwork of state laws that provide differing and 
inconsistent consumer protections. Otherwise, a consumer's privacy 
protections, including their ability to understand their rights, will 
depend on the state where the individual resides. While these state 
laws may be well-intentioned, they must be crafted to not hinder the 
free flow of data needed to provide consumers and businesses with 
financial products and services and process financial transactions.
    As Congress considers the creation of a national data privacy 
framework, we must first recognize the differences in data collection 
among industries. Banks are required by Federal law to collect certain 
information to conduct a customer transaction. For example, if a 
consumer wants to open a checking account, at a minimum pursuant to the 
Bank Secrecy Act, the bank must obtain certain information to fulfill 
its Customer Identification Program requirements, such as date of 
birth, address, and identification number. As an additional benefit to 
customers, banks also use personal data to develop banking products and 
services that are customized to a customer's needs. Utilizing consumer 
data to conduct financial transactions authorized by the consumer is 
far different than a social media platform collecting consumer data to 
sell to marketers.
    It is also important that a Federal privacy standard should not 
unnecessarily expand the scope of data that banks are responsible for 
protecting. GLBA requires banks to protect consumers ``nonpublic 
personal information'', which is defined, in part, as ``[. . .] 
personally identifiable financial information, (i) provided by a 
consumer to a financial institution; (ii) resulting from any 
transaction with the consumer or any service performed for the 
consumer; or (iii) otherwise obtained by the financial institution.'' 
\2\ Consumer is defined to mean ``an individual who obtains or has 
obtained a financial product or service from you that is to be used 
primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, or that 
individual's legal representative.'' \3\ An expansion of the definition 
of covered data or covered persons pursuant to a national standard 
would subject banks to unnecessary and costly regulatory burden without 
any additional benefit to consumers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A national data protection and privacy law must seek to promote 
innovation, investment and competition in the marketplace. The United 
States Constitution authorizes Congress to regulate interstate 
commerce, which includes the free flow of goods and consumer data. A 
patchwork of privacy laws at the state level will lead to higher costs 
for consumers and create barriers to innovation and investment. The 
assumption that preemption weakens existing state laws is a 
misconception of today's digital marketplace. In a world that is 
increasingly mobile, Americans and their devices constantly cross state 
borders. Consumer protection should not depend upon which state you 
reside, but consumers should be covered by one unified, comprehensive 
Federal standard.
    From an international perspective, CBA also supports an open global 
economy that enables growth through the secure and efficient transfer 
of data across international borders. National data protection and 
privacy legislation should continue to support consumer privacy while 
also respecting and coordinating differences between U.S. and foreign 
privacy regimes.
    National data protection and privacy legislation should be enforced 
by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), unless a determination is made 
that it is appropriate for a different regulator to be the enforcement 
agency, e.g., prudential regulators for banks and credit unions. CBA is 
concerned that if 50 state attorney generals bring enforcement actions 
in Federal court, there is a high probability each state will enforce 
the law differently, inviting confusion, complexity and increased 
compliance burden. In addition, a national consumer privacy law should 
not provide for a private right of action.
Data Security and Breach Notification
    It is also critical that any conversation around data privacy also 
take seriously the security of data and the protocol for notifying 
customers in the event of a breach for all who operate within the 
payments system. Banks are on the front lines, investing large amounts 
of operating capital in fraud monitoring and security. Our member 
institutions consistently monitor our customer accounts for fraud and 
work to make consumers whole, no matter where a breach occurs. 
Consumers rely on their financial institutions to communicate what to 
do in the event of a breach and to employ defenses to prevent fraud and 
identity theft.
    Subsequent to Section 501(b) of GLBA, the financial regulators 
issued guidelines requiring banks to implement comprehensive, risk-
based information security programs that include administrative, 
technical and physical safeguards to protect customer information. 
These safeguards are not static but flexible and scalable--applying to 
banks of all sizes. A similar framework should be applied to non-bank 
companies to ensure consumers' sensitive information is protected 
throughout the payment system.
    Banks must also implement a risk-based response program in the 
event of a breach. The program includes an evaluation of the incident 
and an effort to prevent further unauthorized access as well as notice 
to the institution's primary Federal regulator, appropriate law 
enforcement, and importantly, the customers whose information was 
breached and could be misused. CBA supports and urges Congress to 
consider passing legislation that will require others in the payment 
system to provide timely notification to their customers in the event 
of a breach.
    Today, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico 
and the Virgin Islands have enacted legislation requiring private or 
governmental entities to notify individuals of a security breach of 
information involving PII.\4\ Twenty-four states currently have data 
security laws requiring a level of security procedures and practices to 
be in place to protect personal information.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Congress has the constitutional authority to regulate interstate 
commerce through the Commerce Clause, which was written to prevent 
fragmentation of markets and to encourage the free flow of goods and 
services, including information, across the Nation with minimal 
interference. Congress should take seriously its authority and enact a 
Federal data security and breach notification standard and preempt the 
current patchwork of state laws. Breaches put consumers at risk and the 
urgent need for a national standard that will ensure all who operate 
within the payments system employ the strongest safeguards could not be 
more evident as more Americans prefer the ease of the electronic 
payment system to purchase goods and services. Protecting consumer 
information is a shared responsibility of all parties involved.
Lessons from the California Privacy Protection Act
    Lastly, the California Consumer Privacy Act (``CCPA'') is the first 
major consumer privacy law to be adopted at the state level. This 
legislation was written hastily, and the California Attorney General is 
currently reviewing and revising portions of the law through its 
regulatory process. As the California privacy law continues to evolve, 
it would be prudent for Congress to monitor issues with implementation 
and use observations from industry stakeholders to draft a Federal data 
privacy and security standard.
    In general, CBA member banks support providing consumers with an 
expanded set of consumer privacy rights. However, the CCPA as currently 
written has some critical flaws which will harm both consumers and 
businesses. For example, the proposed regulations require a bank to 
specify a concerning level of detail about certain privacy practices, 
which could potentially benefit social engineers looking to commit 
fraud. According to a whitepaper published by Blackhat USA 2019, which 
considers the legal ambiguity surrounding the European Union's General 
Data Protection Regulation's ``Right of Access'' process, ``. . 
.[L]egislators can weaken many of the factors which encourage 
businesses to improperly implement identity verification. Simply 
assuring businesses that rejecting a suspicious right of access request 
in good faith will not later result in prosecution if it turns out that 
the request originated from a legitimate but suspiciously-behaving data 
subject may be all that's needed. . .'' \6\

Using-Privacy-Laws-To-Steal-Identities-wp.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Other concerns with the CCPA include the definition of ``sell'' and 
its impact on service providers, as well as the lack of reasonable 
limitations on consumer privacy rights to protect intellectual property 
and avoid infringement issues. Considering the importance of this issue 
and the impact it will have on both consumers and businesses, it is 
imperative that Congress is thoughtful in drafting meaningful 
legislation to protect consumers and provide businesses with certainty.
    On behalf of our members, I would like to thank you for your 
consideration of our views. We look forward to working with the 
Committee to foster an environment that prioritizes the protection and 
privacy of consumer data while promoting consumer access to credit.

Washington, DC.

Dear Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member Cantwell:

    We write to you in regarding your hearing on ``Examining 
Legislative Proposals to Protect Consumer Data Privacy.'' \1\ EPIC 
appreciates the Committee's focus on data privacy. The time is past due 
for Congress to act on privacy. Congress' failure to pass comprehensive 
baseline privacy legislation or to establish a U.S. Data Protection 
Agency has put Americans' personal data at risk.

Privacy, S. Comm. on Commerce, Sc., and Trans. (Dec. 4, 2019), https://

data-privacy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The U.S. is one of the few developed countries in the world without 
a data protection agency. The practical consequence is that the U.S 
consumers experience the highest levels of data breach, financial 
fraud, and identity theft in the world. And U.S. businesses, with their 
vast collections of personal data, remain the target of cyber-attack by 
criminals and foreign adversaries. The longer the U.S. continues on 
this course, the greater will be the threats to consumer privacy, 
democratic institutions, and national security.
    EPIC warned the Senate about foreign access to consumer data over 
two years ago. In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, EPIC 
President Marc Rotenberg said:

        U.S. consumers, businesses, and the U.S. government face a 
        genuine threat from the unbounded collection of personal data 
        without adequate legal and technical protections. This data is 
        now the target of foreign adversaries. Two years ago it was the 
        OPM breach. Now it is the Equifax breach. I am reluctant to 
        imagine the consequences for the United States of the next 
        major breach.\2\

    But Congress has taken no action.
The United States Needs a Data Protection Agency
    There is an urgent need for leadership from the United States on 
data protection. Virtually every other advanced economy has recognized 
the need for an independent agency to address the challenges of the 
digital age. Current law and regulatory oversight in the United States 
is woefully inadequate to meet the challenges. In 2011, following the 
Facebook and Google consent orders, EPIC believed that the FTC could 
function as an effective privacy agency but that is clearly no longer 
true. Even FTC Commissioner Joe Simons recently conceded in a 
Congressional hearing that the FTC does not have the authority to 
safeguard privacy.\3\ The United States urgently needs a Data 
Protection Agency.

2019).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The FTC is ineffective. The agency ignores most complaints it 
receives, does not impose fines on companies that violate privacy, and 
is unwilling to impose meaningful penalties on repeat offenders.\4\ In 
documents obtained in September 2019 by EPIC, we uncovered 3,000 
complaints new complaints filed with the FTC since the Commission 
proposed the $5 billion settlement with Facebook two months ago.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Earlier this year, our case EPIC v. FTC determined that there were 
over 26,000 complaints against Facebook pending with the Commission.\6\ 
The FTC is simply ignoring thousands of consumer privacy complaints 
about Facebook's ongoing business practices. The Federal Trade 
Commission may help consumers with broken toasters, but the FTC is not 
an effective data protection agency. Even when the FTC reaches a 
consent agreement with a company, the Commission fails to protect the 
interests of consumers.\7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The FTC Chairman has made much of the large fines recently imposed 
against Facebook and Google. But large fines are not the solution to 
data protection. EPIC, Color of Change, the Open Markets Institute and 
others wrote to the FTC in January telling the agency that more than 
fines are necessary in the Facebook case.\8\ Our groups called for 
equitable remedies, including reforming hiring and management practices 
at Facebook. EPIC called for the FTC to require Facebook to unwind the 
acquisition of both WhatsApp and Instagram,\9\ a view that is now 
widely shared by many experts in the antitrust field. Our groups also 
recommended that the FTC require Facebook to add an independent 
director who represents the interest of users and also examine the 
civil rights impacts of Facebook's products and policies.

    The 2011 Facebook Order was the result of an extensive complaint 
filed by EPIC and a coalition of consumer organizations in 2009, 
following Facebook's repeated changes to its privacy settings that 
overrode user preferences and allowed third parties to access private 
information without users' consent.\10\ The FTC has an obligation to 
the American public to ensure that companies comply with existing 
Consent Orders. It is unconscionable that the FTC allowed this 
unprecedented disclosure of Americans' personal data to occur. The 
FTC's failure to act imperils not only privacy but democracy as well.

    For many years, FTC Chairmen and Commissioners assured Congress and 
representatives of the European governments, responsible for 
safeguarding European consumers, that the FTC was an effective privacy 
agency.\11\ One former FTC Chairman even proposed that the FCC's 
privacy jurisdiction be transferred to the FTC because the FTC was 
doing such an incredible job.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ According to the statement of the FTC Commissioners who 
testified before the Senate Commerce Committee in 2012:

    Similar to the Google order, the Commission's consent order against 
Facebook prohibits the company from deceiving consumers with regard to 
privacy; requires it to obtain users' affirmative express consent 
before sharing their information in a way that exceeds their privacy 
settings; and requires it to implement a comprehensive privacy program 
and obtain outside audits. In addition, Facebook must ensure that it 
will stop providing access to a user's information after she deletes 
that information.

    The FTC's problems are not lack of budget or staff. The FTC has not 
even filled the current post for a Chief Technologist. The FTC has 
simply failed to use its current resources and current authorities to 
safeguard consumers.
    Given the enormity of the challenge, the United States would be 
best served to do what other democratic countries have done and create 
a dedicated Data Protection Agency, based on a legal framework that 
requires compliance with baseline data protection obligations.\13\ An 
independent agency could more effectively police the widespread 
exploitation of consumers' personal data and would be staffed with 
personnel who possess the requisite expertise to regulate the field of 
data security.\14\

                                   Washington, DC, December 4, 2019

Hon. Roger Wicker,
Chairman,
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
United States Senate,
Washington, DC.

Hon. Maria Cantwell,
Ranking Member,
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
United States Senate,
Washington, DC.

Dear Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, and Members of the 
Committee:

    The Electronic Transactions Association (``ETA'') appreciates the 
opportunity to submit this statement for the record before the 
Committees hearing, ``Examining Legislative Proposals to Protect 
Consumer Data Privacy.''
    ETA is the leading trade association for the payments industry, 
representing over 500 companies that offer electronic transaction 
processing products and services. ETA's members include financial 
institutions, mobile payment service providers, mobile wallet 
providers, and non-bank online lenders that make commercial loans, 
primarily to small businesses, either directly or in partnership with 
other lenders. ETA member companies are creating innovative offerings 
in financial services, revolutionizing the way commerce is conducted 
with safe, convenient, and rewarding payment solutions and lending 
alternatives.
    ETA and its members support U.S. and international efforts to 
strengthen privacy laws in ways that help the industry combat fraud and 
help consumers understand how their data is being used. As lawmakers 
and regulators explore additional ways to protect consumers, it is 
critical that the government coordinates with the payments industry to 
combat fraud and cybercrime so that all consumers have access to safe, 
convenient, and affordable payment options and other financial 
services.
    A robust financial system is integral to the economy because it 
enables the fundamental functions of economic activity, including 
connecting borrowers with savers, facilitating investments, processing 
payments, and the safekeeping of financial assets. For the U.S. 
financial system to remain competitive in the global economy, the U.S. 
must continue to prioritize consumer protection, safety, and 
reliability, while also continuing to lead in innovation.
    ETA looks forward to encouraging a collaborative approach and 
believes a framework should include the following principles:

   National Standard
    By providing consumers and businesses with consistent protections 
        through an established, uniformed law, consumers and businesses 
        will benefit. Enacting a Federal uniform national standard will 
        provide certainty and consistency to businesses and consumers 
        alike without having to navigate the patchwork of state laws. A 
        uniform national standard--that is the ceiling--would also 
        reduce the complexity and costs associated with the compliance 
        and enforcement issues resulting from a patchwork of laws.

   Permissible Uses
    The payment industry has a long commitment and history of fighting 
        fraud and is constantly developing and deploying new technology 
        to detect, deter, and eliminate fraud. New and enhanced 
        technologies have amplified the payments industry's ability to 
        offer new fraud solutions and strengthen our on-going efforts. 
        Any privacy or data protection standard should include 
        provisions for permissible uses of data to prevent fraud and 
        protect consumers.

   Maximize Transparency
    Businesses must promote transparency with their customers and 
        transparency is also important when engaging with regulators or 
        other appropriate authorities. Regulators and government 
        officials should be appropriately transparent about their 
        objectives.

    With respect to personal data, consumers should have reasonable 
        access to clear and understandable statements about businesses 
        practices and policies. Businesses should be transparent about: 
        the types of personal data collected, how the personal data 
        will be used, and if personal data may be disclosed and/or 
        shared. Businesses should also provide clear privacy notices to 
        consumers and provide appropriate procedures for individual 
        control, including the opportunity to control data sharing.

   Access to Data
    Individuals must have a reasonable right access their personal 
        information that they have provided to a company, and where 
        practical, have that information corrected. Individuals should 
        also have the ability to request the deletion of personally 
        identifiable information provided to companies, unless there is 
        a legitimate or legal obligation to maintain that information.

   Enforcement
    To protect consumer rights and provide responsibility, enforcement 
        needs to be consistent and coordinate between the Federal 
        government and the state's regulatory body. Congress should 
        encourage collaboration between the Federal Trade Commission 
        (``FTC'') and state attorneys general to enforce a national 
        consumer privacy law. Strict coordination should be followed to 
        avoid duplicate or conflicting enforcement actions. ETA 
        believes the FTC should be granted targeted rulemaking 
        authority and have civil penalty authority. However, a Federal 
        privacy law should not provide monetary relief in the form of a 
        private right of action for privacy enforcement.

   Maintaining Flexibility
    Technology that is involved in data processing evolves rapidly. A 
        baseline law can provide clarity on achieving specific privacy 
        principles, however, laws and regulations should undergo 
        reviews and be flexible. A government should not mandate a 
        specific technological solution or other instrument to 
        implement consumer protections. Including a safe harbor within 
        a Federal privacy law would promote the development of 
        adaptable, consumer-friendly privacy programs.

   Global Leadership
    Congress should adopt policies that facilitate international 
        electronic commerce and promote consumer privacy--all which 
        benefit consumers, economic growth, and trade. Burdensome 
        international regulations hamper the growth of new businesses 
        and creates conflict of law between jurisdictions. The U.S. is 
        uniquely positioned to benefit from the experience and 
        regulatory proposals being adopted or considered by its 
        international counterparts. But having the U.S. establish a 
        national privacy framework will facilitate an international 
        data framework and reinforce U.S. leadership worldwide.

    The payments industry never rests--working tirelessly to fight 
fraud and protect consumers, including by developing new tools to 
prevent or identify fraud through the analyzing data and frequently 
introducing new fraud fighting solutions. Privacy laws should continue 
to recognize these goals and the important role the payments industry 
plays in combatting fraud. By working together, lawmakers, regulators, 
and industry participants can protect consumers while providing them 
with access to the safest and most convenient payments system in the 
world.
    ETA would like to thank the Committee for this opportunity to 
provide this statement for the record on this important topic and we 
appreciate your leadership on this important issue. If you have any 
questions, please feel free to contact me directly at 
[email protected].
            Sincerely,
                                             Scott Talbott,
                       Senior Vice President of Government Affairs,
                                   Electronic Transactions Association.

    The Chairman. And we are now delighted to hear from our 
panel, and we will simply begin at this end and move down the 
table. Ms. Brill, you are recognized.

         STATEMENT OF HON. JULIE BRILL, CORPORATE VICE

          PRESIDENT, DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL, AND CHIEF

             PRIVACY OFFICER, MICROSOFT CORPORATION

    Ms. Brill. Thank you so much. Chairman Wicker, Ranking 
Member Cantwell, members of the Committee, thank you for this 
opportunity to testify about the urgent need for comprehensive 
national privacy legislation. It is a privilege to be here. My 
name is Julie Brill. I am Microsoft's Corporate Vice President, 
Deputy General Counsel, and Chief Privacy Officer. I joined 
Microsoft two years ago after more than 25 years of public 
service dedicated to consumer protection, competition, and 
privacy enforcement, including six years as Commissioner of the 
U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
    I want to thank all of you for your work to address the 
privacy concerns of the American people. Your proposals 
recognize that too much of the responsibility for protecting 
privacy in our digital world falls on individuals. Like many of 
you, Microsoft believes that consumers should no longer bear 
the sole responsibility and the sole burden for privacy 
protection. Instead, we believe that consumers should have the 
right to control their own data for sure and that companies 
should be responsible and accountable for the data they collect 
and the way they use it.
    As you know, we live in a remarkable technology driven 
world in an era of change. Over the past few years, cloud 
computing has transformed how we work, how we play, and how we 
connect with one another. Entire industries have been 
reinvented and this is just the beginning. Now rapid advances 
in artificial intelligence are providing unprecedented 
opportunities to create a stronger economy and a healthier and 
more prosperous world. These opportunities are built on the 
ability to collect and analyze data at a scale that has never 
been possible before.
    Some of this data is deeply personal information about our 
health, our jobs, what we believe, where we go, what we buy, 
and so much more. This has profound implications for privacy, 
implications that we have yet to grapple with in this country. 
Privacy is a basic human right and the foundation from which 
all other rights flow, including the rule of law and all of our 
civil liberties. Privacy is also the foundation for consumer 
trust, which will ultimately determine whether we realize the 
promise and reap the benefits of these revolutionary data-
driven opportunities and capabilities. But today in this 
country consumer trust hangs in the balance. Under our current 
laws, the burden on individuals to protect information is 
simply too great.
    As individuals we lack the information we need to 
understand who is using our data and why. The tools to manage 
personal information are often too complex. As a result, 4 out 
of 5 Americans say they have little or no control over the data 
that companies collect about them, 4 out of 5 Americans are 
concerned about how their personal data is used, and 4 out of 5 
Americans believe that the risks from all of this data 
collection outweigh the benefits. The California Consumer 
Privacy Act of 2018 was a significant step toward addressing 
these concerns.
    Now, the time has come for Congress to act. The imperative 
to enact strong Federal privacy protections within a framework 
that enables American innovation to thrive has never been 
greater. At Microsoft we believe privacy legislation should 
reflect four key principles. First, transparency about how 
companies collect, use, and share personal information.
    Second, consumer empowerment that guarantees the right of 
individuals to access, correct, delete, and move their personal 
information to another provider. Third, corporate 
responsibility that requires companies to be good stewards of 
consumer information. And finally strong enforcement through a 
central regulator like the FTC that has the necessary authority 
and funding, and through State Attorneys General.
    We urge members of this Committee to come to a bipartisan 
consensus so that American consumers enjoy the privacy 
protections that so many others around the world already have 
and that are so long overdue in this country. Thank you.

  Prepared Statement of Julie Brill, Corporate Vice President, Deputy 
   General Counsel, and Chief Privacy Officer, Microsoft Corporation
    Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, and Members of the 
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to share Microsoft's views on 
the need for comprehensive Federal privacy legislation.
    My name is Julie Brill. I am Microsoft's Corporate Vice President, 
Deputy General Counsel, and Chief Privacy Officer. I joined Microsoft 
after a long career in public service dedicated to consumer protection, 
competition and privacy, including six years as a Commissioner of the 
U.S. Federal Trade Commission (``FTC'') and more than 20 years working 
at the state level in roles including Chief of Consumer Protection and 
Antitrust for the States of North Carolina and Vermont and head of the 
Privacy Working Group of the National Association of State Attorneys 
General.
    Microsoft has provided me a unique opportunity to continue 
contributing to the future of privacy and consumer protection, because 
it is both a world leader in creating the technologies that are 
transforming people's lives and in the responsible and transparent use 
of personal information. During my time at the company, I have met with 
regulators and customers around the world, and it is clear from these 
meetings that the time for strong privacy legislation is now.
America Deserves a Comprehensive Privacy Law
    We live in a time of remarkable technology-driven change and 
disruption. How people work, play, shop, and learn about the world has 
been transformed over the last decade. Industries have been reinvented. 
New ways to diagnose and treat diseases have emerged. And the way 
people connect with one another has been reimagined.
    Groundbreaking technologies have driven these changes. Cloud 
computing--which enables governments, companies, and individuals to 
analyze and derive insights from data at a scale previously not 
possible--is now the norm, and it is clear that the progress made thus 
far is only the beginning. For example, the rapid emergence of 
artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies holds great 
promise for the future, as does the rise in quantum computing.
    These technologies unquestionably will be transformative and impact 
our daily lives. Even more so than today, they will raise questions 
about how we protect the privacy of personal information.
    Accompanying these technological changes is a global movement to 
adopt sweeping legal frameworks to enhance consumer privacy and protect 
personal information. Europe enacted a landmark data protection law 
that has been in effect since May 2018: the General Data Protection 
Regulation (``GDPR'').\1\ New privacy laws have also recently passed or 
are currently being developed in Brazil, China, India, Japan, Kenya, 
and Thailand.\2\ Each of these legal regimes include some common 
principles for data protection. And, together, they are defining global 
baselines for privacy protection.

Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with 
regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of

    In the United States, California has enacted the California 
Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (``CCPA''), which takes effect this coming 
January.\3\ The CCPA was the first comprehensive privacy law to be 
passed in the United States. Its provisions reflect emerging 
international norms, including rights for consumers to access and 
delete their personal information. Other U.S. states are considering 
new comprehensive privacy laws as well.\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    These state-level efforts are important, as they demonstrate the 
need for comprehensive privacy laws in the United States. U.S. privacy 
law has generally failed to keep pace with advances in technology and 
to provide Americans with the protections they want and need in this 
digital age. Unlike Europeans, or Brazilians, or Chinese nationals, 
Americans today do not enjoy comprehensive privacy protections that 
apply across the country. As a result, 81 percent of Americans have 
reported in a Pew Research Center study released last month that they 
feel they have little or no control over the data collected about them 
and believe that the potential risks they face from companies' 
collection of their data outweigh the benefits.\5\ Nearly the same 
percentage of Americans reported that they were concerned about the way 
their data is being used by companies.

privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Today more than ever, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive 
U.S. privacy law that provides strong protections for all consumers in 
the United States within a framework that enables human ingenuity and 
American innovation to continue to thrive. Americans need a 
comprehensive privacy law because, all too often, they do not have 
sufficient information about who has access to their personal 
information, who is using it, and for what purposes. In many cases, the 
privacy tools currently available to American consumers to exercise 
choices with respect to their personal information are too complex and 
place unreasonable burdens on people to utilize them.
    At the same time, in light of Cambridge Analytica, the Equifax data 
breach, and other recent revelations, Americans are also concerned 
about whether companies are held to sufficiently high standards 
regarding the protection of personal information, and whether companies 
are appropriately held to account when failing to live up to those 
standards. The Pew Research Center study I cited above found that most 
Americans believe their personal information is less secure today than 
in the past, and have little or no confidence in companies' public 
accountability with respect to misuse or compromise of their personal 
information. Given these findings, it is no surprise that the same 
study found that a majority of Americans--regardless of political 
affiliation--strongly favor increased government regulation of 
companies' use of their personal information.
Microsoft's Longstanding Commitment to Privacy
    At Microsoft, we believe that privacy is a fundamental human right 
and that, with recent advances in technology, the protection of this 
right has become more important and more urgent than ever before. 
Privacy is also the foundation of consumer trust, which is crucial to 
realize the promise of advanced data-driven technologies. We know that 
people will only use technology when they trust that it will keep their 
personal information safe and secure, and that companies will collect 
and use consumers' data in ways that are responsible and demonstrate 
that they are worthy stewards of that data.
    Microsoft has continued to put these principles into practice every 
day through ongoing investments in tools that give consumers greater 
control over their personal information and greater visibility into how 
we handle that information. To date, for example, more than 28 million 
people globally--including more than 10 million Americans--have used 
our privacy dashboard to better understand and control their personal 
information. And we have developed a range of products and services 
that enable our enterprise customers to comply with their data 
protection obligations and safeguard their users' information as 
well.\6\

    In addition to our privacy-based innovations, Microsoft has long 
supported and advocated for strong legal frameworks to protect privacy 
in the United States and around the world. We have been a proponent of 
comprehensive Federal privacy legislation in the United States since 
2005.\7\ We were also early supporters of the GDPR, and in May 2018 we 
announced that we would voluntarily extend the rights that are at the 
heart of the GDPR to all of our customers worldwide.\8\ These rights 
include the right to know about the data we collect about consumers, to 
access and correct that data, to delete it, and even to take it to 
another service if they choose. And just last month, we announced that 
we would honor the CCPA's core user control rights for consumers 
throughout the United States, rather than affording them only to 
California residents.\9\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Microsoft welcomes strong privacy laws like the CCPA in California, 
in addition to similarly comprehensive privacy laws being considered in 
other states. The efforts in California and other states have served as 
important catalysts toward the strong Federal privacy law that our 
country requires and deserves.
    Congress should be inspired to build upon these state-led efforts. 
In addition to granting American consumers the right to control their 
personal information and establishing strong mechanisms to enforce 
compliance, we believe that privacy laws should go further by placing 
more obligations on companies to become responsible stewards of 
personal information. These accountability requirements should include 
enhanced transparency about the purposes for which companies collect 
and use personal information, an obligation to collect and use only the 
data reasonably necessary for those purposes, and greater 
responsibility to analyze and improve internal systems to ensure that 
companies are using personal information appropriately and in line with 
reasonable consumer expectations. And companies should have affirmative 
duties to reasonably secure personal information from unauthorized 
access and to avoid unlawful discrimination in violation of Federal and 
state laws.
Necessary Components for a Strong Federal Privacy Framework
    Microsoft believes that comprehensive Federal privacy legislation 
should adhere to four key principles: transparency, consumer 
empowerment, corporate responsibility, and strong enforcement.
    Transparency. Transparency is a centerpiece of virtually all data 
privacy laws existing today. American consumers should have the right 
to be informed, in a concise and understandable manner, about what 
personal information companies collect about them, and how that 
information is used and shared. Companies should provide this 
information in a context-appropriate fashion at the most meaningful 
times during the consumer's experience.
    Consumer Empowerment. User control is also a central feature of 
strong privacy laws. American consumers should be empowered to control 
their personal information and to express their privacy choices in 
accordance with rapidly-emerging global norms. In particular, consumers 
should have rights to access, correct, and delete their personal 
information, and to move their data to other providers.
    In addition, Microsoft believes that Federal privacy legislation 
should specifically regulate practices that consumers do not expect and 
that have a particularly high impact on consumer privacy, such as the 
collection and sharing of personal information by data brokers that 
operate behind the scenes, and are unknown to consumers. To ensure that 
consumers can meaningfully exercise their privacy rights with respect 
to data brokers, Federal privacy legislation should build on concepts 
from the data broker laws enacted by Vermont and California.\10\ The 
Federal law should require data brokers to register with the Federal 
regulator, and to provide information about the kinds of data they 
collect and sell, the location of the consumers whose information is 
affected, and details about how consumers can exercise their data 
control rights.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 9, Sec. Sec. 2446-2447; Cal. Civ. Code 
Sec. 1798.99.80 et seq.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Corporate Responsibility. Companies should act as responsible 
stewards of consumers' personal information, and should be accountable 
for their actions. This should include affirmative obligations for 
companies to minimize the amount of personal information they collect--
limiting it to the data that is reasonably necessary for the purposes 
of collection--and to apply technical and other measures to protect 
that information. Companies also should be required to analyze and 
improve their internal systems to ensure that they are using consumer 
data appropriately and in accordance with reasonable consumer 
expectations, and to document and make these assessments available to 
an oversight authority upon request. Ultimately, the higher the risk 
inherent in the proposed use of data, the greater a company's 
responsibility should be to protect that data. And, as noted above, 
companies should have affirmative duties to reasonably secure personal 
information from unauthorized access, and to guard against unlawful 
discrimination in violation of Federal and state laws.
    Strong Enforcement. Congress should empower a strong central 
regulator, such as the FTC, to issue rules and to appropriately enforce 
the Federal privacy law, and should provide the regulator with 
sufficient authority, technical capability, and funding to do so. This 
will help to ensure that the regulatory agency has sufficient capacity 
and expertise to engage in robust enforcement across the many diverse 
companies and industries that will be in scope.
    A strong Federal law should also empower the State Attorneys 
General to enforce the provisions of the law.
Conclusion
    Microsoft appreciates the desirability of diverse proposals, which 
will lead to more robust discussion and debate about this critically 
important issue. We particularly appreciate the bills and discussion 
drafts that have been released by members of this Committee and others. 
These proposals represent positive steps in the right direction toward 
a comprehensive Federal privacy law.
    Since 2005, Microsoft has partnered with members of this Committee 
to advocate for robust consumer privacy protections, and we are eager 
to continue to do so. We very much appreciate the good work of Chairman 
Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, and other members of the Committee, 
and look forward to that work continuing apace.
    We urge the members of this Committee to come to a consensus that 
will allow all American consumers to enjoy the privacy protections that 
so many others around the world already have.
    We are optimistic that Congress will pass comprehensive Federal 
privacy legislation in the very near future, building on the important 
milestones contained in the CCPA and other state laws. It is past time 
for the United States to pass meaningful privacy laws that apply to 
American consumers regardless of where they live in this country. We 
call on all relevant stakeholders--lawmakers, consumer advocates, 
industry, government, academics, and others--to join us in working to 
pass meaningful privacy protections here in the United States. This is 
an issue worth fighting for.

STATEMENT OF HON. MAUREEN K. OHLHAUSEN, CO-CHAIR, 21st CENTURY 
                       PRIVACY COALITION

    Ms. Ohlhausen. Thank you. Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member 
Cantwell, and other distinguished members of the Committee, 
thank you for the opportunity to testify at this important 
hearing examining legislative proposals to protect consumer 
privacy. I am Maureen Ohlhausen, a Partner at the law firm of 
Baker Botts and the Co-Chair of the 21st Century Privacy 
Coalition which represents the Nation's leading communications 
providers and their trade associations.
    I also served as a Commissioner and Acting Chairman of the 
Federal Trade Commission (``FTC''), our Nation's leading 
consumer privacy agency. But as the collection, use, and 
sharing of personal data has continued to grow, the FTC is 
reaching the limit of its current tools, and consumers and 
businesses are increasingly required to navigate a tangle of 
confusing and often inconsistent privacy requirements from 
various levels of Government. We commend the Committee for your 
leadership and express our support for legislation that will 
provide transparency and control to consumers, robust security, 
and strong accountability as outlined in the FTC's 2012 
Bipartisan Privacy Report.
    We therefore encourage Congress to enact Federal privacy 
legislation that includes three key attributes. First, it 
should provide consumers clarity and visibility into companies' 
data collection, use, and sharing practices as well as choices 
regarding these practices calibrated to the sensitivity of that 
data. Second, legislation should provide a national and uniform 
set of protections and consumer rights throughout our digital 
economy. Third, it should ensure strong enforcement that 
protects consumers from harmful data practices while allowing 
companies to provide innovative products and services that 
consumers want.
    Let me elaborate on those three points briefly. First, an 
optimal approach would balance ease-of-use and transparency by 
giving consumers clear and simple privacy choices based on the 
nature of the relevant information itself, its sensitivity, and 
its risk of consumer harm if such information is misused. 
Sensitive, personal information such as health and financial 
information, real-time geolocation information, and Social 
Security numbers should be subject to the highest protections.
    In turn, to reflect consumer expectations and preferences, 
there should be less stringent requirements on non-sensitive 
personal information as well as on information that is de-
identified or aggregated because such information has a lower 
risk of consumer harm. And for certain types of routine 
operational uses, such as order fulfillment, fraud prevention, 
network management, and some forms of first-party marketing, 
consent should be inferred. Striking the right balance in 
categorizing data as sensitive or non-sensitive is crucial for 
consumers and essential for an effective privacy law.
    Requiring repetitive consumer consent for data collection 
and uses that are expected and raise little risk of substantial 
harm will not only impose unnecessary burdens on consumers, as 
well as businesses, it will also reduce consumers' focus on the 
affirmative consent requests for the types of sensitive data 
whose misuse may lead to more serious consequences. Second, 
legislation should provide a national and uniform set of 
protections and consumer rights throughout our digital economy. 
Put simply, data, and increasingly commerce, knows no State 
boundaries. For this reason, State intervention in this 
quintessentially interstate issue is problematic no matter how 
well-intentioned.
    A proliferation of different State privacy requirements 
would create inconsistent protections for consumers, as well as 
significant compliance and operational challenges for 
businesses of all sizes. Federal legislation should also be 
technology neutral and apply to all entities across the 
Internet ecosystem that make use of consumer data, whether 
technology companies, broadband providers, or retailers, all of 
whom are represented on today's panel.
    Third, a strong privacy law needs to include strong 
enforcement to protect consumers? rights. A single Federal 
privacy law that gives consumers more control over their data 
and the FTC more enforcement authority, will dramatically 
strengthen consumer protections. It should authorize the FTC to 
fine companies for first-time violations, and in certain cases, 
to issue rules to fill in gaps in the law and to keep up with 
developments in technology. It should also give the FTC more 
resources. State AGs should be given the power to enforce any 
new Federal law.
    A consumer privacy law though should not include private 
rights-of-action that would primarily benefit lawyers and 
result in class actions that provide little, if any, relief to 
actual victims. Giving the FTC enhanced authority to provide 
consumer redress would be a more effective way to enable 
consumers to be compensated directly and promptly when 
companies engage in harmful data practices.
    So thank you again for the opportunity to testify today and 
the Coalition looks forward to working with the Committee and 
all stakeholders to craft strong, national privacy legislation. 
And we applaud you for releasing drafts that will provide the 
foundation for Congressional action.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    However, as the collection, use, and sharing of personal data have 
continued to grow in amount and complexity, and consumers and 
businesses are increasingly required to navigate a tangled web of 
confusing, and often inconsistent, data privacy regulations from 
various levels of government, the Coalition believes it is imperative 
that Congress enact comprehensive Federal privacy legislation. We 
therefore commend the Members of this Committee for your leadership in 
releasing proposed Federal privacy legislation to give stronger 
protections to consumers, impart clearer guidance to businesses coupled 
with more accountability, and provide more authority to the FTC to 
police harmful data practices. To avoid a patchwork of inconsistent, 
even conflicting, privacy requirements, Congress needs to act quickly, 
and the Leadership and Members of this Committee today take a very 
important step in that direction.
    The Coalition is part of a strong consensus among businesses, civil 
society groups, and consumers in support of Federal privacy 
legislation. As an extensive survey by the Progressive Policy Institute 
conclusively found, consumers (1) overwhelmingly (i.e., 94 percent) 
want the same privacy protections to apply to their personal 
information regardless of the entity that collects such information and 
(2) overwhelmingly (83 percent) expect to enjoy heightened privacy 
protections for sensitive information and for uses of their sensitive 
information that present heightened risk of consumer harm, again 
regardless of the company charged with maintaining it.\3\

collected' said Peter Hart.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    What we all have in common is a desire for there to be clear 
consumer privacy protections that apply throughout the nation, no 
matter where you live, work, or travel. We want consumers to enjoy 
confidence that their personal information is not subject to different 
protections within a state or from state to state. We are supporters of 
strong consumer privacy rights and believe firmly in providing 
transparency and control to consumers, robust security, and strong 
accountability as outlined in the FTC's bipartisan 2012 landmark

Key Elements of an Effective Federal Framework
    We strongly believe that Congress needs to enact Federal privacy 
legislation that includes three key attributes. First, it should 
provide consumers clarity and visibility into companies' data 
collection, use, and sharing practices, as well as choices regarding 
these practices, calibrated to the sensitivity of that data. Second, 
legislation should provide a national and uniform set of protections 
and consumer rights throughout our digital economy. Third, it should 
ensure strong enforcement that protects consumer from harmful data 
practices, while also allowing companies to provide and develop 
innovative products and services that consumers want.
1. Reflect consumer preferences through simple choices based on the 
        sensitivity of data
    KWe believe that an optimal approach would balance ease of use and 
transparency by giving consumers clear and simple privacy choices based 
on the nature of the relevant information itself--its sensitivity and 
the risk of consumer harm if such information is the subject of an 
unauthorized disclosure. A Federal privacy law should promote consumer 
control and choice by imposing requirements for obtaining meaningful 
consent based on the risks associated with different kinds and uses of 
consumer data. We also believe that consumers should have certain 
rights of access, correction, and deletion where appropriate.
    So-called sensitive personal information, such as health and 
financial information, real-time geo-location information, social 
security numbers, and children's information, should be subject to the 
highest protections. In turn, to reflect consumer expectations and 
preferences, there should be less-stringent requirements on non-
sensitive personal information, as well as information that is de-
identified or aggregated because such information has a lower risk of 
consumer harm or association with a particular individual. And, for 
certain types of routine operational uses, consent should be inferred. 
As recognized by the FTC in its 2012 Report, these uses, which include 
order fulfillment, fraud prevention, network management, and some forms 
of first-party marketing, are expected by consumers and provide them a 
variety of benefits, including knowing about promotions and discounts 
tailored to their existing services and products.
    Striking the right balance in categorizing data as sensitive or 
non-sensitive is crucial for consumers and essential for an effective 
privacy law. A regime that requires consumers to constantly provide 
consent for data collection and uses that are expected and raise little 
risk of substantial harm will not only impose unnecessary burdens on 
consumers (as well as businesses), but will also reduce consumers' 
focus on the affirmative consent requests for the types of sensitive 
data whose misuse may lead to more serious consequences.
    A Federal privacy law must also recognize that consumers have a 
wide variety of preferences about the benefits of sharing their 
personal data. Legislation should not limit consumer choice by, for 
example, inhibiting consumer-friendly incentive programs tied to 
privacy choices, such as rewards or loyalty programs. Rather, the law 
should require that companies give consumers clear and comprehensible 
information about the categories of data that are being collected, 
used, or shared, and the types of third parties with which information 
may be shared. So long as consumers are provided with clear information 
about the nature of such programs, they should be allowed to make their 
own choices, especially because such programs often involve significant 
cost savings and other benefits to consumers.
2. Provide a national and uniform set of protections and consumer 
        rights throughout our digital economy
    As discussed above, a new Federal privacy law should provide 
meaningful consumer control and choice over consumers' personal data 
based on the sensitivity of such information. Such strong privacy 
protections need to apply to consumers regardless of where in the 
United States they live, work, or happen to be accessing information. 
By its very nature, the Internet connects individuals across state 
lines. Put simply, data (and, increasingly, commerce) knows no state 
boundaries. For this reason, state intervention in this 
quintessentially interstate issue is problematic, no matter how well 
intentioned it may be. A proliferation of different state privacy 
requirements would create inconsistent privacy protections for 
consumers, as well as significant compliance and operational challenges 
for businesses of all sizes. It also erects barriers to the kind of 
innovation and investment that is a lifeblood of our Nation's economy 
and to many beneficial and consumer-friendly uses of information. 
Indeed, even the authors of California's 2018 privacy law recognized 
the wisdom of preempting municipal privacy laws.
    Federal legislation should also be technology-neutral and apply to 
all entities across the Internet ecosystem that make use of consumer 
data, whether technology companies, broadband providers, or retailers, 
all of whom are represented on today's panel. What matters is not who 
collects the data, but what data is collected, how sensitive it is, and 
how it is protected and used.
3. Ensure strong accountability and enforcement that best protects 
        consumer interests
    The Members of this Committee recognize that Congress must develop 
a law that guarantees strong privacy rights to consumers and adopts 
best practices from state laws, while creating uniformity across the 
Nation. But preempting state laws should not mean weakening protections 
for consumers. A Federal consumer privacy law needs to be a strong one. 
The Coalition believes that states, as well as the FTC, have a critical 
role to play in protecting and enforcing those rights.
    The FTC should have the primary authority to enforce a national 
privacy law. As privacy concerns become weightier and more complex, the 
FTC is reaching the limits of its current tools. Under its existing 
legal regime, in which the FTC polices privacy under its Section 5 
authority to prevent unfair and deceptive acts or practices, when the 
FTC goes after a company for an initial privacy violation, it can 
require the company to change its practices through a consent order. In 
very limited circumstances, the FTC can obtain (non-punitive) monetary 
redress for consumers if the agency can show direct consumer losses. 
Only if a company later violates that order--and a judge agrees there 
has been such a violation--can the FTC impose a financial penalty (as 
opposed to obtaining consumer redress).
    We believe the FTC needs to be able to fine companies for first-
time violations of the new, comprehensive privacy law to provide 
sufficient incentives for companies to take the necessary steps to 
ensure responsible use and protection of consumer data. In certain 
cases, Congress should also give the Commission the authority to issue 
rules to fill in gaps in the law and to keep up with developments in 
technology. These rules will add clarity to the law so that companies 
understand what kind of behavior is out of bounds as technology and 
business practices evolve.
    Congress must also provide the FTC with more resources to protect 
consumer privacy in America. Despite the ever-growing need for privacy 
enforcement, the FTC's budget has been flat since 2013. The number of 
full-time employees lags behind where it was in the early 1980s--nearly 
four decades ago, when the phrase ``big data'' meant an encyclopedia 
and the United States had one hundred million fewer people. The 
Internet and the collection, use, and sharing of consumer data have 
grown enormously without a similar boost in FTC resources. We urge 
Congress to address that widening gap if we are serious about tackling 
an issue as important and complicated as consumer privacy.
    We also recognize that state attorneys general (AGs) are critical 
allies in the realm of consumer protection. They should be given the 
power to enforce any new Federal law. A consumer privacy law, though, 
should not include private rights of action, which often result in 
class actions that primarily benefit attorneys while providing little, 
if any, relief to actual victims. Private rights of action also 
frequently result in the diversion of company resources from compliance 
to litigation, which ultimately does not help consumers who, at the end 
of the day, simply want companies to follow the law. Nor would it be 
appropriate to ban pre-dispute arbitration clauses in the context of a 
new privacy law.
    Providing the FTC and state AGs with enforcement power, backed up 
with civil fining authority and expanded resources, represents a far 
better approach for consumers, as evidenced by the successful and 
bipartisan work in policing violations of children's privacy through 
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Providing the FTC with 
enhanced authority to provide consumer redress would also ensure that 
consumers can be compensated directly and promptly when companies 
engage in harmful data practices.
Conclusion
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today. The Coalition 
looks forward to working with all Members of the Committee and all 
stakeholders in crafting strong national privacy legislation, and we 
applaud the Committee's Leadership and other Members for releasing 
drafts that will provide the foundation for Congressional action.
    The United States would benefit significantly from a strong and 
unified, technology-and industry-neutral Federal privacy law that 
applies uniformly to all entities, regardless of their business model. 
A new Federal law that preempts state laws would provide both consumers 
and businesses with necessary guidance and give consumers much-needed 
control over their data. Such a Federal law would provide the greatest 
clarity and certainty about the rights of consumers, as well as the 
responsibilities of companies that collect, use, or share consumers' 
personal information.
    That is why a new law, backed up by an experienced and expert 
agency like the FTC--one with expanded powers and resources--is the 
best hope for consumers when it comes to meaningful privacy 
protections.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much. Ms. Moy.

      STATEMENT OF LAURA MOY, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LAW,

          GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW CENTER; DIRECTOR,

          COMMUNICATIONS & TECHNOLOGY LAW CLINIC; AND

       ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, CENTER ON PRIVACY & TECHNOLOGY

    Ms. Moy. Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Wicker, Ranking 
Member Cantwell, distinguished members of the Committee. It is 
an honor to present before this Committee today and among such 
distinguished panelists, so thank you very much. Americans are 
desperate for greater privacy protections.
    As Ms. Brill mentioned just a moment ago, 81 percent of 
Americans feel that the potential risks of companies collecting 
data about them outweigh the benefits. Almost 70 percent are 
not confident that companies will use their personal 
information in ways that they will be comfortable with. And 
almost 80 percent believe that if companies misuse or 
compromise personal information, they won't admit mistakes and 
take responsibility. And they are clear that they want the 
Government to step in. Seventy-five percent say there should be 
more regulation. In fact one recent poll showed that the 
majority of Americans feel that the threat to personal privacy 
online is a crisis and we need forced changes to the way 
companies operate.
    That sounds like a directive not just to legislate but to 
legislate boldly in a way that transforms data practices and 
now is not the time for a light touch approach. And that is why 
I am pleased to see that there are multiple bills before this 
committee that offers strong, meaningful reform. That said, 
there certainly are differences among the bills, and I 
discussed many of them in my written statement but right now I 
would like to highlight three key things that I hope this 
Committee will not lose sight of as it negotiates a path 
forward.
    First, Congress must reject privacy legislation that does 
not include civil rights protections. This is not just me 
saying this. This Committee received a letter back in February 
this year signed by dozens of public interest organizations, 
including civil rights and racial justice giants such as Asian 
Americans Advancing Justice, Color of Change Human Rights 
Campaign, Lawyers Committee, NAACP, National Organization for 
Women Foundation, National Urban League, The Leadership 
Conference, Unidos U.S., the list goes on and on.
    A total of 43 organizations signed the letter urging the 
Committee, ``privacy rights are civil rights.'' Protecting 
privacy in the era of big data means protecting against uses of 
consumer information that concentrate harms on marginalized 
communities while concentrating profits elsewhere. Online 
discrimination is not just theoretical. Studies have shown that 
data-driven advertising has resulted in extreme bias in ads for 
housing, employment, and credit.
    For example, research published this year showed that even 
when advertisers did not specify a demographic audience for 
their ads, Facebook's data driven advertising engine displayed 
ads for jobs in the lumber industry to an audience that was 72 
percent men or 72 percent white and 90 percent men. Supermarket 
cashier positions were shown to 85 percent women. Jobs with 
taxi companies were shown to 75 percent black users. These 
aren't idle concerns, this is serious.
    In terms of where a lack of privacy could take us, this is 
the worst case scenario, a future where our decisions aren't 
our own, where opportunities aren't available to everyone 
because we have been so tracked and profiled and targeted that 
we see a different Internet with different opportunities than 
other people. Many people say that America is a land of 
opportunity and is it? If we want to honor the American value 
of opportunity, we have to fight to preserve it. And I am very 
pleased that multiple bills before this committee would help to 
do that by addressing discriminatory uses of data, with the 
strongest provisions in the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act 
bill that was introduced last week by Ranking Member Cantwell 
with Senators Schatz, Klobuchar, and Markey. Second, we need 
robust enforcement. It is not enough to create rights in name 
only.
    We need bold action to design a law to be vigorously 
enforced so that data practices will change dramatically as 
they must. The FTC has 40 people working on privacy and data 
security. That is fewer people than are in this room right now. 
That is plainly not enough. In contrast, the UK has more than 
500 people working in its information commissioner's office. 
Ireland's data protection commission has about 110 employees.
    Adding State Attorneys General is helpful, but that too 
will only go so far. For example, earlier this year the Office 
of the California State AG said that it would have the ability 
to prosecute only three cases a year. It is news to no one that 
the country is big and if we really want the law to be 
enforced, we are going to need even more. The true force 
multiplier would be to establish a private right of action, a 
step that again multiple proposals before this Committee would 
take.
    Third, Congress should not encroach on State's regulatory 
efforts. As Congress considers establishing new privacy and 
data security protections for private information, it shouldn't 
eliminate existing protections that already benefit Americans 
at the State level nor should it preempt the States' right to 
develop new ways to protect their citizens.
    States are innovating in this space right now and making 
valuable contributions. I appreciate the Committee's commitment 
to doing something about privacy. Attempting to review the 
bills before the Committee and preparation for this hearing was 
no easy task, as we were discussing before the hearing, because 
there are many of them with a variety of really interesting and 
great ideas.
    Thank you again and I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Moy follows:]

Prepared Statement of Laura Moy, Associate Professor of Law, Georgetown 
   University Law Center; Director, Communications & Technology Law 
     Clinic; and Associate Director, Center on Privacy & Technology
Introduction and Summary
    Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, and Members of the 
Committee, thank you for inviting me here today. I am Laura Moy, an 
associate professor at Georgetown Law and director of the law school's 
Communications & Technology Law Clinic. I appreciate the opportunity to 
testify today on consumer privacy. I make six points:

  1.  Congress must accept that a strong consumer privacy law will 
        force business practices to change. That change will be costly 
        for companies. Companies may protest a strong privacy law, but 
        Congress should take its lead from people, not companies. 
        Congress should accept that meaningful regulation requires an 
        adjustment period.

  2.  Privacy legislation must contain use restrictions. It is not 
        enough to require companies merely to disclose what they plan 
        to do with consumer data; rather, they should be restricted to 
        uses that are reasonable. And some applications of consumer 
        data should simply be off-limits.

  3.  Congress must not accept legislation without civil rights 
        protections. The most troubling use of data is to facilitate 
        discrimination. Congress should prohibit uses of data that 
        selectively deny access to--or awareness of--opportunities in 
        housing, education, finance, employment, and healthcare.

  4.  Congress should not step on states' toes. As Congress considers 
        establishing new privacy and data security protections for 
        Americans' private information, it should not eliminate 
        existing protections that already benefit Americans at the 
        state level. Nor should it preempt the states' right to develop 
        new ways to protect their citizens. States are innovating in 
        this space right now and making valuable contributions.

  5.  There are valuable provisions in multiple bills before this 
        committee. The Committee should be commended for working 
        diligently and creatively to develop legislation that meets 
        growing demands for privacy protection.

  6.  If Congress cannot agree on legislation that embodies the Public 
        Interest Privacy Legislation Principles, it should not act. One 
        option before Congress is to hold its pen. If Congress cannot 
        produce a bipartisan bill that synthesizes the valuable 
        provisions across bills to embody the principles advanced by 
        public interest organizations over a year ago, perhaps it 
        should wait--and allow states to continue to fill the gap.
1. We need regulation that changes the industry
    As Congress considers how best to address calls for consumer 
privacy protections, it should not shy away from major reforms. 
Congress must accept that a strong consumer privacy law will force 
business practices to change, and that will be costly for companies. 
But major change is necessary, both to address consumers' longstanding 
unanswered privacy concerns and to rein in harmful misuses of consumer 
data that should never have been allowed to become entrenched.
    According to a recent poll, a majority of Americans now feel that 
``the threat to personal privacy online is a crisis, and we need forced 
changes to the way companies operate.'' \1\ Americans overwhelmingly 
feel they have no control and little understanding about how their 
information is used. Following a large survey of thousands of U.S. 
adults, Pew Research Center reported in November that 81 percent say 
they have very little or no control over the data companies collect and 
59 percent have very little or no understanding about what companies do 
with the data collected.\2\ At the same time, Americans plainly have 
deep privacy concerns, with the survey revealing that:

internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-
feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/.

   81 percent feel the potential risks of companies collecting 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        data about them outweigh the benefits;

   72 percent say they personally benefit very little or none 
        from companies collecting data about them; and

   79 percent are very or somewhat concerned about how 
        companies use the data collected.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    These privacy concerns are distributed across industries. A 
whopping 85 percent of Americans are concerned a lot or a little about 
how much personal information social media sites know about them, 84 
percent about advertisers, and 80 percent about companies they buy 
things from.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Americans also have a striking lack of trust in companies' ability 
and incentives to address this problem:

   69 percent are not too confident or not at all confident 
        that firms will use their personal information in ways they 
        will be comfortable with;

   79 percent are not too confident or not at all confident 
        that companies will admit mistakes and take responsibility if 
        they misuse or compromise personal information; and

   57 percent are not too confident or not at all confident 
        that companies follow what their privacy policies say they do 
        with users' personal data.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ Id.

    And Americans agree that government needs to do more to address 
this problem. According to the same Pew survey, 75 percent of U.S. 
adults say there should be more regulation than there is now. That 
includes both Republicans (70 percent) and Democrats (81 percent).\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In the absence of robust regulation, although providers of online 
sites and services often engage in ongoing conversations with civil 
rights, civil liberties, and public interest groups, they nevertheless 
have repeatedly failed to respect and protect data relating to 
millions--and at times billions--of users. In recent years the lack of 
strong privacy protections has led to countless highly publicized 
failures such as when Cambridge Analytica successfully used Facebook's 
platform to learn private information about many more than 87 million 
users, and when Google revealed that it was still tracking users' 
location through use of its services even after users had disabled the 
``Location History'' feature.\7\

tracking-history-weather-maps.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Privacy legislation must contain use restrictions
    Many of our privacy laws in past years have been based on a notice 
and consent (or ``transparency and control'') framework--the idea that 
companies should be able to do what they please with consumer data so 
long as they are open about it and get permission. But it is time to 
recognize we need more, and to adopt meaningful use restrictions. Some 
uses of data are clearly harmful. In addition, consumers can no longer 
easily understand what they are disclosing when they share information 
online. The consent model also has reached the limits of scalability 
and is no longer feasible as a practical matter.
    Consumers and policymakers alike now recognize a wide range of 
harms from certain data-driven content distribution models. On many 
platforms and services, consumer data is used to predict what 
advertisements, products, or other content a consumer will like or 
otherwise engage with so that they can be shown that information, for 
the purpose of maintaining their interest and generally holding them on 
the service for as long as possible. There are obvious incentives for 
companies to employ this model, under theories that (1) it is more 
efficient to show a consumer something she is interested in rather than 
waste computing power showing her something irrelevant to her, and (2) 
it is beneficial to keep a consumer's interest for as long as possible 
for the purpose of displaying more ads, products, or other content to 
her. But many consumers object to data-driven personalization. 
According to a 2019 privacy and security survey conducted by security 
company RSA:

   Only 31 percent of U.S. respondents believe that tailored 
        newsfeeds are ethical;

   Only 37 percent believe that it's ethical to make 
        recommendations to a user based on purchase/browsing history; 
        and

   Only 38 percent believe that using a ``like'' history to 
        recommend content is ethical.\8\

Disconnect Between Consumers and Businesses (2019), https://

    Consumers are concerned about data-driven distribution models with 
good reason. There is growing information that these models can lead to 
a number of harms not only to individual consumers, but to society more 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
broadly. For example, these models can lead to:

   Widening political polarization. Data-driven models may be 
        more likely to promote hyper-partisan content, which in turn 
        may exacerbate political polarization. As one prominent legal 
        scholar has written, ``Self-insulation and personalization are 
        solutions to some genuine problems, but they also spread 
        falsehoods, and promote polarization and fragmentation.'' \9\

Social Media at 5 (2017).

   Dissemination of propaganda, misinformation, and 
        disinformation. Consumer data may be used to generate and 
        target false information, including state-sponsored propaganda, 
        careless or low-quality reporting, and false information 
        designed to undermine democracy.\10\

   Public health threats. Data-driven models that equate user 
        ``engagement'' with success may be designed to be addictive and 
        inescapable.\12\ Addiction to social media and other services 
        can lead to a cascade of other problems, including heightened 
        rates of depression, suicide, and sleep deprivation among young 
        people.\13\

products intentionally to addict users).

by negatively comparing oneself to others on social media platforms.

Experts have also found that teens who spend three hours a day or more 
on electronic devices are 35 percent more likely to have a risk factor 
for suicide and 28 percent more likely to get less than seven hours of 
sleep. Jean M. Twenge, Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?, The 
Atlantic, Sept. 2017, https://www.the
atlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-
generation/534198/. Data-driven content distribution has also led to 
the proliferation of dangerous health-related misinformation. See, 
e.g., Christine Hauser, Drinking Bleach Won't Cure Autism or Cancer, 
F.D.A. Says, N.Y. Times, Aug. 13, 2019, https://www.nytimes.com/2019/
08/13/health/drinking-bleach-autism-cancer.html (the FDA was forced to 
counter medical misinformation telling consumers to drink bleach 
solutions as cures for autism, cancer, H.I.V./AIDS, and other 
conditions).

   Distribution of discriminatory advertisements. Data-driven 
        ad distribution can result in information about critical 
        opportunities being systematically withheld from entire classes 
        of people.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outcomes, Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (2019), 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02095 [hereinafter Discrimination Through 
Optimization].

    Use restrictions may not be able to prevent all of these harms 
entirely, but should prohibit at least the most egregious misuses of 
data, as well as create obligations for companies that employ data-
driven distribution models to detect problems such as those described 
here and take steps to address them.
    Use restrictions are also needed because meaningful consent is no 
longer feasible in all circumstances as a practical matter.\15\ There 
are too many data exchanges every single day for consumers 
realistically to understand all of them and read every privacy 
policy.\16\ And as we become surrounded by always-on connected devices, 
it is increasingly difficult for companies to solicit and receive 
consent. It remains important for companies to be transparent about 
their practices and to be required to observe user rights attaching to 
consumer data, but use restrictions would provide a much-needed 
backstop to protect against inappropriate uses of data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \15\ There is a lengthy discussion of this problem in the testimony 
of Professor Woodrow Hartzog before this Committee earlier this year.

before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation 
regarding ``Policy Principles for a Federal Data Privacy Framework in 
the United States (Feb. 27, 2019), available at https://

to keep track of, given the potentially hundreds of websites a user 
might visit on any given day. To read all of these privacy policies 
would be extremely time consuming and extremely costly.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition, use restrictions are needed because it has become 
exceptionally difficult for consumers to understand what they are 
disclosing when they share information online. Today, very sensitive 
information about a consumer can be inferred from data that seems less 
sensitive. For example:

   Cell phone sensors might be used to infer whether or not 
        someone has Parkinson's;\17\

    This Committee should seek to further develop use restrictions in 
privacy legislation. Two bills before the Committee contain provisions 
that serve as good starting points. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights 
Act (COPRA) introduced just last week by Ranking Member Cantwell and 
Senators Schatz, Klobuchar, and Markey, as well as the Privacy Bill of 
Rights Act introduced by Senator Markey, prohibit discriminatory uses 
of data as described above, as well as certain uses of biometric 
information.\20\

introduced by S. Markey).

    Notice and consent has clear limits. For privacy legislation to 
protect consumers, it must contain meaningful use limitations as well.
3. Congress must not accept legislation that does not contain civil 
        rights protections
    Congress should reject out of hand any consumer privacy proposal 
that does not contain civil rights protections. If Congress is going to 
legislate, it should legislate for all consumers. One important way to 
do this is to ensure that consumer data cannot be used to facilitate 
discrimination or otherwise to selectively deny access to--or awareness 
of--critical opportunities in housing, education, finance, employment, 
and healthcare.
    Indeed, the public interest community has been consistent in its 
insistence that antidiscrimination must be a part of any consumer 
privacy law. The Public Interest Privacy Legislation Principles signed 
by 34 organizations in November 2018 state, ``Automated decision-
making, including in areas such as housing, employment, health, 
education, and lending, must be judged by its possible and actual 
impact on real people, must operate fairly for all communities, and 
must protect the interests of the disadvantaged and classes protected 
under anti-discrimination laws.'' \21\ In February, 47 organizations 
sent a letter to this Committee that stated in part,

        Civil rights protections have existed in brick-and-mortar 
        commerce for decades. It is time to ensure they apply to the 
        Internet economy as well. Online services should not be 
        permitted to use consumer data to discriminate against 
        protected classes or deny them opportunities in commerce, 
        housing, employment, or full participation in our democracy. 
        Congress should require companies to be transparent about their 
        collection and use of personal information in automated 
        decision-making. Companies must also anticipate and protect 
        against discriminatory uses and disparate impacts of data.\22\

    In April, many of those organizations sent this Committee a follow-
up letter reiterating the importance of centering civil rights concerns 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
and urging Congress to:

   1)  Prohibit the use of personal data to discriminate in employment, 
        housing, credit, education, or insurance--either directly or by 
        disparate impact.

   2)  Prohibit the use of personal data to discriminate in public 
        accommodations and extend such protections to businesses that 
        offer goods or services online.

   3)  Prohibit the use of personal data to engage in deceptive voter 
        suppression.

   4)  Require companies to audit their data processing practices for 
        bias and privacy risks.

   5)  Require robust transparency at two tiers: easy-to-understand 
        privacy notices for consumers, and comprehensive annual privacy 
        reports for researchers and regulators. Companies must 
        completely disclose how they collect and use personal data, 
        including their algorithmic processing practices.

   6)  Enable researchers to independently test and audit platforms for 
        discrimination.

   7)  Empower a Federal agency with rulemaking authority, enforcement 
        powers, and enough resources to address current and future 
        discriminatory practices.

   8)  Provide individual rights to access, correct, and delete one's 
        personal data and inferences made using that data.

   9)  Provide a private right of action. Marginalized communities 
        historically have not been able to rely upon the government to 
        protect their interests, so individuals need to be able to 
        vindicate their own rights.

  10)  Establish baseline nationwide protections and allow states to 
        enact stricter laws. Under no circumstances should Congress 
        enact any legislation that could preempt state civil rights 
        laws, many of which are stronger than Federal law. For example, 
        many states extend greater antidiscrimination protections to 
        the LGBTQ+ community than Federal law.\23\

    Congress must honor these requests from the public interest 
community because at present, these impermissible uses of information 
are widespread. For example, Facebook made assurances in 2017 to tackle 
discriminatory advertising on its platform after facing public outrage 
and pressure from advocates regarding its ``ethnic affinity'' 
advertising clusters, but the Washington State Attorney General later 
found that it was still possible to exclude people from seeing 
advertisements based on protected class membership.\24\ Earlier this 
year civil rights organizations settled lawsuits with Facebook over 
charges that the platform enabled landlords and real estate brokers to 
exclude families with children, women, and other protected classes of 
people from receiving housing ads, and also facilitated gender 
discrimination in job ads.\25\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The systematic targeting and exclusion of communities can be a 
byproduct of algorithmic content and ad distribution that optimizes for 
cost-effectiveness and user ``engagement,'' which can lead to 
distribution that is discriminatory in impact, if not intent.\26\ For 
example, this year a team of researchers found that when sponsored 
employment ads were posted on Facebook for a wide range of positions, 
including janitors, nurses, lawyers, the platform's algorithms 
delivered ads in a way that demonstrated clear race and gender 
bias.\27\ More specifically, the platform displayed ads for jobs in the 
lumber industry to an audience that was 72 percent white and 90 percent 
men, for supermarket cashier positions to 85 percent women, and for 
jobs with taxi companies to 75 percent black users. This type of 
discriminatory outcome occurred even though the advertisers never 
specified a demographic audience for the ads.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To prevent these types of unacceptable outcomes, any new privacy 
legislation should outright prohibit the use of consumer data to 
facilitate discrimination, and also should force companies to conduct 
their own forecasting and testing to determine whether discrimination 
is occurring on their platform or is likely to occur.
    Multiple bills attempt to deliver in this area. COPRA is the only 
bill before this committee that would both prohibit discriminatory uses 
of data and force companies to take steps to determine whether their 
data practices are likely to lead to discriminatory outcomes.\28\ 
Others that would prohibit discriminatory uses of data include the 
Digital Accountability and Transparency to Advance Privacy Act (DATA 
Privacy Act) introduced by Senator Cortez Masto and the Privacy Bill of 
Rights Act.\29\ The Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019 introduced 
by Senators Wyden and Booker would also force prospective impact 
assessments.\30\ Congress should look to provisions in these bills for 
guidance on this matter.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Any new privacy legislation should establish standards that attach 
substantive legal obligations to collection and use of consumers' data, 
and that protect Americans from discriminatory uses of data.
4. Congress should not encroach on states' innovative regulation
    As Congress considers establishing new privacy and data security 
protections for Americans' private information, it should not step on 
the toes of states also racing to protect their citizens in the face of 
rising privacy threats. Americans are asking for more protections for 
their private information, not less. States are responding to that 
call.
    Indeed, a number of state laws play an important role in filling 
gaps that exist in Federal legislation. Many states have expanded the 
scope of their data security and breach notification laws to extend 
protections to previously unregulated market sectors and private data--
and consumers in those states are benefiting from those existing laws. 
For example, Connecticut's data security and breach notification 
statute covers entities operating at multiple nodes of the health care 
pipeline.\31\ California adopted a data security statute--the Student 
Online Personal Information Protection Act (SOPIPA)--that is tailored 
to online educational platforms.\32\ SOPIPA prompted twenty-one other 
states to adopt student data security laws modeled on California's 
example.\33\ Minnesota adopted a law requiring Internet Service 
Providers (ISPs) to maintain the security and privacy of consumers' 
private information.\34\ And Texas now requires any nonprofit athletic 
or sports association to protect sensitive personal information.\35\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \31\ C.G.S.A. Sec. 38a-999b(a)(2) (``health insurer, health care 
center or other entity licensed to do health insurance business in this 
state, pharmacy benefits manager . . . third-party administrator . . . 
that administers health benefits, and utilization review company.'').
    \32\ West's Ann.Cal.Bus. & Prof.Code Sec. 22584(d)(1) (schools must 
``[i]mplement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices 
. . . and protect that information from unauthorized access, 
destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.'').

the security and privacy of a consumer's personally identifiable 
information.'').

reasonable procedures . . . to protect from unlawful use or disclosure 
any sensitive personal information collected or maintained by the 
business in the regular course of business.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Some states have also expanded the types of information that data 
holders are responsible for protecting from unauthorized access, or for 
notifying consumers of when breached. For example, ten states have 
expanded breach notification laws so that companies are now required to 
notify consumers of unauthorized access to their biometric data--unique 
measurements of a person's body that can be used to determine a 
person's identity.\36\ This important step recognizes that a biometric 
identifier such as a fingerprint or iris scan--unlike an alphanumeric 
password--cannot be changed after it has been compromised. A large 
number of states also now require companies to notify consumers about 
breaches of medical or health data--information that can be used in aid 
of medical identity theft, potentially resulting in fraudulent 
healthcare charges and even introduction of false information into 
one's medical record.\37\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \36\ States that have done this include Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, 
Maryland, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Wisconsin, and 
Wyoming.

Kill You, MLMIC Dateline (Spring 2015), available at https://

patient receiving medical care fraudulently can lead to the real 
patient receiving the wrong blood type, prescription, or even being 
misdiagnosed at a later time.''). Medical or health data is covered by 
breach notification laws in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Delaware, 
Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, 
Oregon, Puerto Rico, Nevada, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, and 
Wyoming.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    And states are doing other important work on privacy as well. In 
addition to the California Consumer Privacy Act,\38\ California also 
has a law requiring notification about breaches of information 
collected through an automated license plate recognition system.\39\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To avoid doing harm to consumers benefiting from these existing 
consumer protections, any Federal legislation on privacy or data 
security must preserve strong state standards, as well as states' 
ability to continue innovating on privacy. There are bills currently 
before the Committee that can be used as a model for crafting this 
provision. A number of privacy bills before this Committee are silent 
on preemption of state laws and presumably would only invalidate those 
that are in conflict. Bills that would expressly avoid preemption of 
stronger state laws include the Algorithmic Accountability Act and 
COPRA.\43\ In contrast, bills that would explicitly preempt state 
laws--even those that offer consumers stronger privacy protections and 
potentially even general consumer protection laws--include the 
Balancing the Rights Of Web Surfers Equally and Responsibly Act of 2019 
(BROWSER Act) introduced by Senator Blackburn and the U.S. Consumer

5. There are valuable provisions in multiple bills before this 
        committee
    The public interest community has asked for a number of major 
reforms to set things right. Proposals before this committee contain 
provisions that would deliver many of those reforms, and the Committee 
can use those provisions as models to develop legislation that honors 
the Public Interest Privacy Legislation Principles.\45\ For example, 
provisions in legislation before this Committee would establish a 
number of the items outlined in those Principles:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \45\ See Public Interest Privacy Legislation Principles, https://
newamericadotorg.s3.amazon
aws.com/documents/Public_Interest_Privacy_Principles.pdf.

   Consumer rights to data access, quality, portability, and 
        security. Bills that would give consumers important rights to 
        data access, quality, portability, and security include COPRA 
        and the Privacy Bill of Rights Act, as well as the U.S. 
        Consumer Data Privacy Act discussion draft circulated last week 
        by Senator Wicker.\46\

NaZ (discussion draft circulated by S. Wicker in Nov. 2019).

   Data minimization. The Privacy Bill of Rights Act should 
        serve as a model on this point, because it would prohibit the 
        collection of personal information unless it is needed to 
        perform a contract, to provide a requested product or service, 
        or to take steps at the request of the individual.\47\ COPRA 
        would prohibit the collection and retention of personal 
        information not covered by the covered entity's articulated 
        purposes as expressed in a privacy policy.\48\

introduced by S. Markey).

(2019).

   A prohibition on discriminatory uses of data.\49\ Congress 
        should look to COPRA as a model on this point, because it 
        prohibits discriminatory uses of data, and also would force 
        companies to take steps to determine whether their data 
        practices are likely to lead to discriminatory outcomes.\50\ 
        Other bills that would prohibit discriminatory uses of data 
        include the DATA Privacy Act and the Privacy Bill of Rights 
        Act.\51\ The Algorithmic Accountability Act also provides 
        another example of how companies could be made to detect 
        discriminatory outcomes resulting from their practices.\52\

   Robust rulemaking authority for a Federal agency. Bills that 
        would establish robust rulemaking authority for a Federal 
        agency include COPRA, the Privacy Bill of Rights Act, and the 
        DATA Privacy Act, and these bills can be used as models for 
        crafting agency rulemaking authority.\53\ Some bills would only 
        grant much more limited rulemaking authority. For example, the 
        U.S. Consumer Data Privacy Act discussion draft would only give 
        the FTC rulemaking authority to establish requirements for 
        covered entities to verify requests associated with privacy 
        rights, but not to honor those rights more broadly.\54\ Other 
        bills would grant rulemaking authority limited to a narrower 
        scope of privacy coverage, such as the Commercial Facial 
        Recognition Privacy Act of 2019 introduced by Senators Blunt 
        and Schatz, the Deceptive Experiences To Online Users Reduction 
        Act (DETOUR Act) introduced by Senators Warner and Fischer, the 
        Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019, the Do Not Track Act 
        introduced by Senator Hawley, the Data Broker List Act of 2019 
        introduced by Senators Peters and McSally, and the Protecting 
        Privacy in Our Homes Act introduced by Senator Gardner.\55\

   Additional staff and resources for an expert agency. COPRA 
        should serve as a model to grant staff and resources for an 
        expert agency, because it would enable the Federal Trade 
        Commission to form a new privacy and data security bureau, and 
        authorization appropriations for the Commission to carry out 
        all activities associated with the law.\56\ The DATA Privacy 
        Act would enable the Commission to appoint additional personnel 
        and authorize appropriations for that purpose.\57\ The U.S. 
        Consumer Data Privacy Act would authorization appropriations to 
        assist the Commission with enforcement, but not rulemaking or 
        oversight.\58\ The Markey-Hawley bill updating the Children's 
        Online Privacy Protection Act would add a Youth Privacy and

   Enforcement rights not only at the Federal level, but also 
        for state attorneys general and private citizens. COPRA should 
        serve as a model on enforcement. It would enable individuals to 
        vindicate their own rights in court, and importantly also 
        clearly provides guidelines for meaningful relief.\60\ The 
        Privacy Bill of Rights Act also contains language that crafts a 
        private right of action.\61\ Most privacy bills currently 
        before this Committee also include critical enforcement powers 
        for state attorneys general. Those that do not include the 
        DETOUR Act, the BROWSER Act, the Data Broker List Act of 2019,

        prohibiting privacy-related forced arbitration.

    A number of proposals also contain other substantial reform 
measures. For example, COPRA would expressly protect privacy 
whistleblowers from retaliation for providing information to 
enforcers.\63\ The Do Not Track Act introduced by Senator Hawley would 
institute a Do Not Track system and require operators of sites and 
services to honor Do Not Track signals by refraining from data 
collection.\64\ The Data Broker List Act would facilitate enrollment of 
data brokers in a national registry and place certain restrictions on 
data brokers.\65\ And the Markey-Hawley children's privacy bill would 
strengthen privacy protections for children and minors.\66\

6. If Congress cannot agree on legislation that embodies the Public 
        Interest Privacy Legislation Principles, perhaps it should not 
        act
    One option before Congress is to hold its pen. Although there are 
many valuable provisions in bills before this Committee that Congress 
can draw from as it continues to work toward comprehensive consumer 
privacy legislation, Congress has yet to produce a bipartisan bill that 
embodies the Public Interest Privacy Legislation Principles advanced by 
34 public interest organizations over a year ago and attached here.\67\ 
It is better for Congress to wait--and allow the states to continue to 
fill the gap--than to rush to pass something that does not fulfill 
these important principles.

    Unregulated data collection and use in the United States has eroded 
public trust in companies to safeguard and use data responsibly. 
Surveys show that, while individuals often try to remove or mask their 
digital footprints,\1\ people think they lack control over their 
data,\2\ want government to do more to protect them,\3\ and distrust

    The current U.S. data privacy regime, premised largely upon 
voluntary industry self-regulation, is a failure. Irresponsible data 
practices lead to a broad range of harms, including discrimination in 
employment, health care, and advertising, data breaches, and loss of 
individuals' control over personal information. Existing enforcement 
mechanisms fail to hold data processors accountable and provide little-
to-no relief for privacy violations.
    The public needs and deserves strong and comprehensive Federal 
legislation to protect their privacy and afford meaningful redress. 
Privacy legislation is essential to ensure basic fairness, prevent 
discrimination, advance equal opportunity, protect free expression, and 
facilitate trust between the public and companies that collect their 
personal data. Legislation should reflect at least the following ideas 
and principles:
1. Privacy protections must be strong, meaningful, and comprehensive
    Privacy concerns cannot be fully addressed by protecting only 
certain classes of personal data held by some companies. Legislation 
should mandate fairness in all personal data processing, respect 
individuals' expectations for how data should be treated, provide for 
data portability, and include safeguards against misuse of data, 
including de-identified and aggregate data. Legislation should advance 
fundamental privacy rights and require all entities that collect, 
store, use, generate, share, or sell (collectively, ``process'') data 
both online and offline to comply with Fair Information Practices \5\ 
(collection limitation, dataquality, purpose specification, use 
limitation, security safeguards, openness, access and correction 
rights, and accountability) across the complete life cycle of the data. 
Legislation should require all data processing to be clearly and 
accurately explained, justified, and authorized by the individual. 
People should have the right to know when their data has been 
compromised or otherwise breached. Additionally, legislation should 
require entities processing data to adopt technical and organizational 
measures to meet these obligations, including risk assessments of high-
risk data processing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ Fair Information Practices are similar to those adopted by the 
OECD. See OECD Privacy Framework, http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/
oecd_privacy_framework.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Data practices must protect civil rights, prevent unlawful 
        discrimination, and advance equal opportunity
    Legislation should ensure fundamental fairness of and transparency 
regarding automated decision-making. Automated decision-making, 
including in areas such as housing, employment, health, education, and 
lending, must be judged by its possible and actual impact on real 
people, must operate fairly for all communities, and must protect the 
interests of the disadvantaged and classes protected under anti-
discrimination laws. Legislation must ensure that regulators are 
empowered to prevent or stop harmful action, require appropriate 
algorithmic accountability, and create avenues for individuals to 
access information necessary to prove claims of discrimination. 
Legislation must further prevent processing of data to discriminate 
unfairly against marginalized populations (including women, people of 
color, the formerly incarcerated, immigrants, religious minorities, the 
LGBTQIA/+ communities, the elderly, people with disabilities, low-
income individuals, and young people) or to target marginalized 
populations for such activities as manipulative or predatory marketing 
practices. Anti-discrimination provisions, however, must allow actors 
to further equal opportunity in housing, education, and employment by 
targeting underrepresented populations where consistent with civil 
rights laws. Moreover, decades of civil rights law have promoted equal 
opportunity in brick-and-mortar commerce; legislation must protect 
equal opportunity in online commerce as well.
3. Governments at all levels should play a role in protecting and 
        enforcing privacy rights
    The public consistently call for government to do more, not less, 
to protect them from misuse of their data. Legislation should reflect 
that expectation by providing for robust agency oversight, including 
enhanced rulemaking authority, commensurate staff and resources, and 
improved enforcement tools. Moreover, no single agency should be 
expected to police all data processors; therefore, legislation should 
empower state attorneys general and private citizens to pursue legal 
remedies, should prohibit forced arbitration, and importantly, should 
not preempt states or localities from passing laws that establish 
stronger protections that do not disadvantage marginalized communities.
4. Legislation should provide redress for privacy violations
    Individuals are harmed when their private data is used or shared in 
unknown, unexpected, and impermissible ways. Privacy violations can 
lead to clear and provable financial injury, but even when they do not, 
they may, for example, cause emotional or reputational harm; limit 
awareness of and access to opportunities; increase the risk of 
suffering future harms; exacerbate informational disparities and lead 
to unfair price discrimination; or contribute to the erosion of trust 
and freedom of expression in society. In recognition of the many ways 
in which privacy violations are and can be harmful, legislation should 
avoid requiring a showing of a monetary loss or other tangible harm and 
should make clear that the invasion of privacy itself is a concrete and 
individualized injury. Further, it should require companies to notify 
users in a timely fashion of data breaches and should make whole people 
whose data is compromised or breached.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much. Ms. O'Connor.

 STATEMENT OF NUALA O'CONNOR, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF 
           COUNSEL, DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP, WALMART INC.

    Ms. O'Connor. Thank you, Chairman Wicker. Thank you, 
Ranking Member Cantwell, members of the Committee. It is an 
honor to be with you today and to be a part of this 
distinguished panel. My name is Nuala O'Connor and I serve as 
the Senior Vice President and Chief Counsel for Digital 
Citizenship at Walmart.
    Walmart is using technology and data to help our customers 
save money and live better. Walmart customers, the busy working 
families of America, have integrated technology into almost 
every aspect of their daily lives and we are trying to respond 
to their needs and how they shop. For example, connecting our 
app to our in-store experience helps make it easier to return 
items purchased online, to scan receipts, and keep track of 
what you have spent this holiday season, and allows our 
customers to seamlessly and securely understand their shopping 
experience.
    Data, both about products and about customers, is helping 
us better source and manage our supply chain more efficiently 
and quickly ship orders and helps us anticipate our customers' 
needs. Walmart is using data in every way from food safety to 
responding to weather emergencies for our associates and 
customers. We at Walmart believe that data and technology can 
help our customers save money and live better, and Walmart also 
recognizes that while personal data does enhance the consumer 
experience, it also creates meaningful responsibility on the 
part of the companies that hold it.
    Walmart's goal is quite simply to be the country's most 
trusted retailer. And just as our customers trust Walmart to 
provide them everyday low prices, quality goods, and a fast and 
friendly store experience, so too our customers trust us to 
protect their data and to use their data in a way that benefits 
them. I joined Walmart because it is already leading the way in 
the responsible use of data and technology in our daily lives. 
Walmart is living these values, including respect for the 
individual, as it deploys data and technology to serve the 
customers' needs. Respect for an individual for us means 
meeting people where they are, literally in the stores and 
online, and in all cases safeguarding their transactions and 
their identity.
    Our business is selling products to the customer, not 
selling the customers' personally identifiable information. 
Walmart is committed to working with policymakers to create 
public policy that enhances consumer privacy, whether these 
customers exist in the physical world, the digital world, or 
increasingly as is the case, both. We strongly support the 
bipartisan efforts of the members of this Committee as we work 
toward a national privacy law that protects the rights of all 
consumers in the United States.
    Toward that goal, we would like to offer the following 
points for the Committee's consideration. First, as has already 
been said, a comprehensive privacy law is urgently needed at 
the Federal level. A patchwork of inconsistent State laws is 
insufficient to protect the individual and is inefficient for 
interstate commerce. Second, legislation focused on a 
particular industry sector must be carefully crafted to avoid 
unintended effects on retail or other sectors.
    And third, a comprehensive privacy law must consider the 
needs and operations of companies online, offline, and in the 
blended or Omni-channel model. Legislation must not 
disadvantage or privilege similar activities in the digital or 
physical world. As a longtime privacy professional, I am 
delighted to see momentum toward a comprehensive Federal 
privacy law, most recently in the drafts released last week by 
Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member Cantwell. We greatly 
appreciate the transparency and consumer rights created in both 
proposals, the emphasis on data security which is so essential 
to maintaining personal privacy, the specific provisions that 
recognize commonly controlled and branded identities, and the 
recognition that data is used for broader consumer benefits 
such as product recalls.
    We appreciate the balance struck by Chairman Wicker with 
structured rulemaking authority at the Federal Trade 
Commission, and we do share broader industry concerns with 
Ranking Member Cantwell's draft related to the provisions on 
private rights of action and preemption. We also believe some 
elements of both proposals have serious concerns for legitimate 
and beneficial uses of technology, such as using data to 
shorten wait times at our stores, communicating with customers 
about the timing of their grocery pickups, and otherwise 
facilitating the customer experience and transaction 
efficiency.
    Thank you again, Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member 
Cantwell for the opportunity to share a little about how 
Walmart works to maintain and safeguard our customers' trust. 
We strongly support your efforts to update public policy to 
reflect the daily reality of our customers, whose retail habits 
include online transactions, store transactions, and many that 
are combination of both. We look forward to supporting your 
efforts as you work toward a national Federal privacy law. I 
stand ready to answer your questions. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. O'Connor follows:]

 Prepared Statement of Nuala O'Connor, Senior Vice President and Chief 
             Counsel for Digital Citizenship, Walmart Inc.
    Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, and Members of the 
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to be here today. It is an 
honor to be part of such a distinguished panel. My name is Nuala 
O'Connor and I serve as the Senior Vice President and Chief Counsel for 
Digital Citizenship at Walmart. Walmart is a leading retailer serving 
customers in stores, online, and through their mobile devices. As our 
customers' shopping habits and expectations have changed, Walmart 
continues to evolve to meet their needs.
    Our customers have integrated technology into almost every aspect 
of their daily lives--including how they shop. Our customers expect a 
seamless experience, in store and online.
    Walmart is using technology and data to help our customers save 
both time and money. For example, connecting our app to our stores 
makes it easier to return items in a store after purchasing online. 
Data--both about products and about customers--is helping us better 
source and manage our supply chain, more efficiently and quickly ship 
orders, and helps us anticipate customers' needs. Walmart is also using 
data and technology to improve food safety and respond to weather 
emergencies for our associates and customers. Indeed, it is very 
appropriate that we are talking about service and shipping and shopping 
today. Did you know there are only 21 shopping days until Christmas?
    We at Walmart believe that data and technology can help our 
customers save money and live better. Walmart also recognizes that 
while personal data can enhance the customer experience, it creates 
responsibility on the part of the companies that hold it.
    Walmart's goal is, quite simply, to be the country's most trusted 
retailer. Just as our customers trust Walmart to provide every day low 
prices, quality goods, and a fast and friendly store experience, so too 
our customers trust us to protect their data, and to use that data in a 
way that benefits them. While technology may have changed how we 
operate our business, it has not--and it will not--change our values.
    In my brief time at Walmart, I've learned the importance the 
company places on its core values, including Respect for the 
Individual. It means meeting people where they are with dignity. In 
store, it means we greet our customers and help them find what they 
need. Online, it also means we greet our customers and help them find 
what they need. And in all cases, we safeguard their transactions and 
identity. Our business is selling products to the customer, not selling 
the customer's personally identifiable information.
    Walmart is committed to working with policymakers to create public 
policy that will enhance consumer privacy, whether we meet those 
customers in the physical world, in the digital world, or, as is 
increasingly the case, both. We strongly support the bipartisan efforts 
of Members of this Committee as we work towards a national privacy law 
that protects the rights of all consumers in the United States.
    Broadly, we support:

   Customer Control--Customers should have reasonable controls 
        with regard to the collection, use and sharing of personal 
        data. Customers should have an opportunity to reasonably 
        access, correct or delete their data while limiting the sale of 
        their data to third parties and its use in digital advertising.

   Retail Sensibility--Federal privacy policy should reflect a 
        world blended with physical and digital experiences.

   Consistency--Policymakers should harmonize U.S. privacy 
        legislation, preempting a patchwork of state laws.

   Flexibility--The rights and obligations of a national 
        framework should be sufficiently flexible to preserve the 
        ability for companies to innovate for their customers.

    Towards that goal, we would like to offer a few reflections for the 
Committee's consideration:

    First, a comprehensive Federal privacy law is urgently needed; a 
patchwork of inconsistent state law is insufficient to protect 
individual privacy and is inefficient for interstate commerce.
    Because our roots are in the physical world, our perspective may 
differ from companies that operate primarily online. Walmart operates 
more than 4,700 stores in the United States. Each week, nearly 160 
million people around the country shop with us--either at one of our 
stores or online. Our stores are present in local communities and are 
part of Americans' daily lives in every state. Our customers often know 
our store associates by name and these personal relationships build 
trust. When customers buy something from our shelves, they trust us to 
have sourced it responsibly and to have priced it accordingly. They 
trust it to be a genuine product. They trust that they are being 
treated fairly.
    Responsible data privacy is part of that trust. Building that trust 
requires clarity and consistency. While states have an important part 
to play, a patchwork of state laws would only serve to complicate, not 
clarify, the customer experience. For example, if I use my Walmart app, 
which you should all download if you haven't already, on my 516-area 
code number, from my home in Maryland, to order the WoodWick Frasier 
Fir holiday candle to send to my sister in New Jersey (which in fact I 
did just last week--it's amazing), from our website hosted in 
California, and the candle is shipped from Arkansas, which state 
privacy law would the company need to adhere to as it processes my 
data? My state? Or my sister's? Alternatively, if a customer lives on 
the California border and shops at a Walmart in Nevada, does the Nevada 
store necessarily then give that customer, or all customers, California 
rights? Absent alignment on state privacy laws, these implementation 
questions add complexity, uncertainty, and cost for the customer and 
company alike.
    Second, legislation focused on a particular industry sector must be 
carefully crafted to avoid unintended effects on retail or other 
sectors.
    For example, the concept of data portability was originally 
intended to provide greater control over an individual's social media 
communications or online accounts. However, data portability may have 
negative consequences in a blended business model or other industries. 
Should a national privacy law require us to directly port our customer 
data to another competitor, even in aggregated form, we are concerned 
that this data could be reverse engineered and allow competitors to 
discern proprietary business information and processes. Additionally, 
we have concerns about the security of customer data while in transit. 
We believe that the concept of data portability must simultaneously 
recognize values of individual privacy, technological innovation, and 
data security. We appreciate the work of Senators Warner, Hawley, and 
Blumenthal on data portability in their ACCESS Act (S. 2658) and we 
hope to see similarly nuanced treatment of data portability in the 
bipartisan bill.
    Third, a comprehensive privacy law must consider the needs and 
operations of companies online, offline, and blended, or omnichannel. 
Legislation focused solely on the online space must not disadvantage or 
privilege similar activity in the physical world.
    In my time at Walmart, I've learned a lot of acronyms, and so one I 
want to leave with you to day is: BOPI. What is a BOPI? It is a 
transaction where you buy something online and pick up instore. Walmart 
is doing great things with online grocery ordering and instore pickup 
and I encourage you to check it out. I did my first BOPI a few years 
ago, when I was buying a new bicycle for my daughter. As a busy working 
mother, I was scouring the Internet late one night for deals on this 
particular yellow bike she wanted. Many excellent retailers could have 
sent it to us and dropped it, unassembled, on my front porch. But 
Walmart had it ready for pickup, already assembled. I walked in and 
showed them my phone with the purchase information, and I spent the 
weekend riding bikes with my children, instead of putting that bike 
together. That's the success of online ordering and instore pickup. It 
saved my family time and money, and allowed us to live better. That is 
our goal, and we hope legislation will provide a level playing field 
for companies, whether online, offline, or omnichannel--which is both.
    Data portability is just one example of how policy to address 
digital actors can have unintended consequences for retail operations. 
We look forward to a continued dialogue with Members of this Committee 
to better understand things such as whether or not retailers are 
considered ``edge providers'' and how algorithm notification should 
apply to retail websites where sometimes hundreds of algorithms are 
used to create a seamless, consumer-requested personalization.
    As a longtime privacy professional, I am delighted and grateful to 
see this momentum towards a comprehensive privacy law. Most recently, 
in the drafts released last week by Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member 
Cantwell, we greatly appreciate the transparency and consumer rights 
created by both proposals; the emphasis on data security--which is so 
essential to maintaining personal privacy; the specific provisions that 
recognize commonly controlled and branded entities; and the recognition 
that data is used for broader consumer benefits, such as product 
recalls. We appreciate the balance struck by Chairman Wicker with 
structured rulemaking authority for the Federal Trade Commission. 
Conversely, we share broader industry concerns with Ranking Member 
Cantwell's draft related to provisions on private rights of action and 
preemption. We also believe some elements of both proposals could 
impede legitimate and beneficial uses of technology, such as using data 
to shorten wait times at our stores; communicating with customers about 
the timing of grocery pickups; and otherwise facilitating the customer 
experience and transaction efficiency.
    Finally, regarding data practices at Walmart, please see the 
attached appendix. Thank you again, Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member 
Cantwell, for the opportunity to share how Walmart works to maintain 
and safeguard our customers' trust. We strongly support your efforts to 
update public policy to reflect the reality of our customers, whose 
retail habits include online transactions, store transactions, and some 
that are a combination of both. We look forward to supporting your 
efforts as you work towards a national privacy law. I stand ready to 
answer any questions you may have.
                    APPENDIX: Data usage at Walmart
    We look forward to a continued dialogue during this process as we 
work to ensure customers' rights are protected not just in retail but 
across all industries.
    Below please see data practices and usage as they apply to Walmart 
Inc. in the U.S., which includes Walmart Stores, Sam's Club and several 
recently acquired companies. Our customer-facing privacy policies 
describe our online and offline customer data practices. This 
information describes our practices related to individually 
identifiable customer data, not data that has been aggregated or 
anonymized. The data practices of Walmart's recently-acquired companies 
generally align with those of Walmart Inc. and Sam's Club. To the 
extent that there are substantive differences, they are noted in the 
discussion below.
    Direct/indirect data collection (including from third parties): 
Walmart collects data to complete transactions and to provide services 
for our customers. The customer data we collect is also used to enhance 
the design of our customers' experiences in our stores, on our mobile 
apps, and online. For us, the purpose of data collection is to provide 
the best products and shopping experience to our customers, not to turn 
our customers into products.
    The specific categories of customer information we collect, 
directly or indirectly, to better serve our customers include 
information we receive from our customers and information we receive 
from others:

   Personal Information Provided Directly by Our Customers--Our 
        customers provide personal information directly to us, whether 
        by creating accounts on our digital properties (e.g., 
        Walmart.com, Walmart Mobile App/Walmart Pay, Sam's Club 
        Membership), through transactions online, by shopping in one of 
        our physical locations, or through other services we offer 
        (e.g., Auto Centers, Vision Centers, and Pharmacies).

   Personal Information Provided by 3rd parties--We also 
        receive personal information about our customers from other 
        sources to help correct or supplement our records, improve the 
        quality and personalization of our services, and to detect, 
        prevent and, investigate fraud.

   Purchase/Transaction History--When customers shop with us, 
        whether online or in our stores, we collect data about their 
        purchases and transactions not only to facilitate common retail 
        functions like payment processing, product returns, and product 
        recalls, but also to develop insights that will inform our 
        efforts to make our customers' interactions with us easier and 
        more enjoyable, and to let our customers know about other 
        products and services they may want.

   Health Care Data--We also seek to help patients live 
        healthier lives by using the data they provide to our 
        pharmacies, vision centers, and care clinics. We use patient 
        data to deliver treatment, payment, and health care services as 
        well as to perform health care operations. The data is 
        collected either directly from the patients or may be collected 
        from their physicians, health insurance company, or others 
        involved directly in their health care. Treatment and health 
        care services include programs such as medication therapy 
        management or prescription refill reminders. Health care 
        operations include internal analytics and quality review 
        activities. We collect, protect, and use this data in 
        compliance with state and Federal health care privacy and 
        security laws.

   Browsing Information --In order to provide a continuous and 
        more personalized shopping experience, we use tools to collect 
        browsing information, such as first-party cookies and web 
        beacons to collect information about the use of our websites 
        and mobile apps. From this, we can measure the effectiveness of 
        our online customer interactions to help improve the customer 
        shopping experience for future visits while also ensuring a 
        seamless and pleasant experience during the current session. 
        For example, this would allow our customers to shop on our 
        website, leave to check another site, and then return to our 
        site where they left off and continue their shopping 
        experience. As a participant in ad networks, we allow third-
        party cookies on our website in order to provide our customers 
        with a more personalized experience, where products are 
        presented through more relevant advertising, and for website 
        analytics.

   Device Information--When customers use our online sites, 
        mobile apps, or other services, we may collect technical device 
        information in order to provide our services. Examples of 
        device information we collect include Internet Protocol (IP) 
        address, the type of mobile device or browser used, a unique 
        device identifier, and other information about a customer's 
        session on our websites.

   Location Information--We are continually improving the in-
        store shopping experience to make it easier for our customers 
        to locate products within the store. For example, when 
        accessing Walmart.com from a desktop browser, we are able to 
        use our customers' IP address to help them locate the nearest 
        store. When customers enable location sharing through one of 
        our mobile apps on their devices, we can provide information 
        about the nearest Walmart or Sam's Club. Also, enabling 
        location sharing allows customers to search a store's unique 
        product inventory, locate departments and products within the 
        store, and facilitate online grocery pick-up. Finally, we may 
        be able to recognize the location of a mobile device in stores 
        where we provide customers free WiFi access.

    We do not sell or rent individually identifiable customer data to 
third parties. Under some circumstances, we may share individually 
identifiable customer data with third parties: (i) to help with our 
business activities, including fulfilling customer orders and 
processing payments through service providers like shipping or billing 
vendors, payment card processors, third-party delivery services, and 
our marketplace vendors; (ii) to offer optional third-party service or 
installation plans on the products we sell, and to offer co-branded 
products or services, such as a co-branded Walmart credit card; (iii) 
in response to a valid legal or law enforcement inquiry, subpoena or 
search warrant or for the protection and safety of customers; (iv) to 
help customers choose from a range of financial services products for 
which Walmart is an agent; or (v) with a customer's consent.
    Some of Walmart's recent acquisitions share customer information, 
such as customer names, addresses, and e-mail addresses, with other 
companies for their own marketing and business purposes. These sharing 
practices are disclosed in the privacy policies of the Walmart 
acquisitions that participate in these practices, and customers can opt 
out of this sharing.
    Data Usage: Aggregate and anonymized customer data provides us with 
insights to improve our services and products. There are also some 
instances where individually identifiable customer data is used to 
enhance these insights or provide our customers with a more 
personalized experience. For example, we use such insights to better 
communicate with our customers through e-mail, social media, and 
responses to surveys. Additionally, we use data about our customers' 
purchases to make it easier for them to quickly reorder frequently 
purchased items and personalize product recommendations.
    Customer Access: Customers who have an online account can view the 
information they have provided to us online and also a record of their 
recent online transactions and purchases made in-store using Walmart 
Pay. Since the ability for the customer to view this information is 
tied to accessing the profile for the online account, customers without 
online accounts with us are unable to view similar information. 
Patients of our pharmacies, vision centers, and clinics have the 
ability to request copies of their medical records and may also request 
an accounting of how their Protected Health Information has been 
disclosed in accordance with applicable law. Beginning in January 2020, 
we will provide California residents with additional ability to request 
access to their personal information as specified under CCPA.
    Advertising: Walmart uses customer information to offer advertising 
services to third parties. However, Walmart does not share individual 
customer's personally identifiable information as part of this 
business. We also allow third-party cookies on our website in order to 
permit our advertisers to provide our customers with a more 
personalized experience, where their products are presented through 
more relevant advertising.

    The Chairman. Thank you so much. Ms. Richardson.

               STATEMENT OF MICHELLE RICHARDSON,

                  DIRECTOR, PRIVACY AND DATA,

               CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY & TECHNOLOGY

    Ms. Richardson. Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, 
thank you for the opportunity to testify today about Federal 
privacy legislation. CDT is a nonprofit tech policy 
organization that advocates for privacy, security, and free 
expression online. For 25 years we have supported a 
comprehensive Federal privacy law that cuts across all sectors 
and this hearing is evidence that Congress is closer than ever 
to accomplishing that. When we testified before you about a 
year ago, we asked that Congress pursue legislation that would 
do four things.
    First, a law should shift the burden of privacy and 
security from users back onto companies where it belongs. To do 
that, it should have clear rules about the collection, use, and 
sharing of personal information in addition to any notice and 
consent framework. Second, a new privacy law should empower 
individuals to control their own data. Third, it should 
prohibit discriminatory uses of data and ways that harm 
underrepresented groups or disadvantaged groups. And fourth, a 
new law should build strong enforcement mechanisms that will be 
able to investigate and pursue violations of all these new 
requirements.
    We are very pleased to say that between all of the bills 
before this Committee, we are substantially the way there. We 
have the right framework and the right principles, but we now 
need to stitch them together in a way that drives systemic 
change and how companies collect, use, and share information 
about us. Our written statement will address further details 
but today I would like to flag two things, one, corporate 
responsibility and two, enforcement.
    First, corporate responsibility, especially for data use. 
What happens to data after a person consents to its collection? 
What are a company's continuing obligations after an individual 
signs up for a product? How do we get to a world and a legal 
framework were opting in to use a product is just the beginning 
of a company's commitment to users instead of the end of it? 
The bill sponsored by the Committee members have made 
substantial headway here. For example, we are ecstatic to see 
that data security is now included in all of the major 
proposals, and that the leading Republican and Democratic bills 
recognize that civil rights and discriminatory data uses 
deserve special attention is a huge step forward for those who 
often bear the brunt of the most egregious practices online.
    We know there are still disagreements about what the bills 
call minimization or loyalty to customers, and the questions 
beyond discriminatory uses, are there other data uses that are 
so risky they should be prohibited? How do we discourage some 
of the most offensive cases of over collection or surprising 
use of data and do so in a systemic way and not just on a user-
by-user basis? To that end, we recommend the Committee be bold 
in this area.
    Many of the components are already there. For example, 
bills by the Chair and Ranking Member mentioned necessity and 
proportionality, important concepts for scoping corporate 
behavior, and some of the bills also mentioned purpose 
limitations, an important concept for respecting the context in 
which data is first collected. One way to make these concepts 
exceptionally clear and operational on day one is to make a 
list of prohibited activities.
    You could, for example, take some of these sets of 
sensitive data categories that are already in your bill, remove 
them from the opt-in regime, and say you simply just can't 
collect, use, or share them outside of the product that a 
person actually signed up for. We look forward to working with 
you on shaping that as it goes forward. The second topic I want 
to talk about today is enforcement, especially a private right 
of action. Much has been said about this topic being a make or 
break topic in the overall privacy debate. We would like to 
propose that the right solution probably lies somewhere between 
allowing individuals to sue over everything or sue over 
nothing. It is important to note that right now all 50-state 
unfair and deceptive practice laws include a private right of 
action.
    These are the general purpose consumer protection laws that 
states could rely on to enforce privacy and security right now 
if they do not have a statute of their own. Some of them are 
very narrow, admittedly, but they do exist. And if our new 
Federal privacy law is essentially going to strike and replace 
these sorts of laws, we need to create a private right of 
action to keep consumers whole and ensure that they have at 
least as many enforcement options as they do now under State 
law.
    Congress does have a lot of options here though. State and 
Federal laws are full of examples where legislators hemmed in 
litigation and directed it toward what they believed were 
really the most serious harms that consumers should be able to 
remedy. They include everything from the right to cure 
problematic behavior to letting Government agencies determine 
whether and how cases can go forward. This Committee should dig 
in and think about those sorts of controls that they could put 
on private rights of action to find a middle ground here for 
consumers and companies.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today. We 
are at an exciting moment where the public, Government 
officials, and even companies have an interest in rebalancing 
our privacy laws to better favor people and we look forward to 
working with you to seize this moment and pass privacy 
legislation in 2020.

Prepared Statement of Michelle Richardson, Director, Privacy and Data, 
                   Center for Democracy & Technology
    On behalf of the Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT), thank you 
for the opportunity to testify about comprehensive Federal privacy 
legislation. CDT is a nonpartisan, nonprofit 501(c)(3) charitable 
organization dedicated to advancing the rights of the individual in the 
digital world. CDT is committed to protecting privacy as a fundamental 
human and civil right and as a necessity for securing other rights such 
as access to justice, equal protection, and freedom of expression. CDT 
has offices in Washington, D.C., and Brussels, and has a diverse 
funding portfolio from foundation grants, corporate donations, and 
individual donations.\1\

The Need for Comprehensive Federal Legislation
    The U.S. privacy regime today does not efficiently or seamlessly 
protect and secure Americans' personal information. Instead of one 
comprehensive set of rules to protect data throughout the digital 
ecosystem, we have a patchwork of sectoral laws with varying 
protections depending on the type of data or the entity that processes 
the information. While this approach may have made sense decades ago, 
it now leaves a significant amount of our personal information--
including some highly sensitive or intimate data and data inferences--
unprotected.
    Our current legal structure on personal data simply does not 
reflect the reality that the Internet and connected services and 
devices have been integrated into every facet of our society. Our 
schools, workplaces, homes, automobiles, and personal devices regularly 
create and collect, and, increasingly, infer, intimate information 
about us. Everywhere we go, in the real world or online, we leave a 
trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal who we know, what we believe, 
and how we behave. Overwhelmingly, this data falls in the gaps between 
regulated sectors.
    The lack of an overarching privacy law has resulted in the regular 
collection and use of data in ways that are unavoidable, have surprised 
users, and resulted in real-world harm. A constant stream of 
discoveries shows how this data can be repurposed for wholly unrelated 
uses or used in discriminatory ways.
    While the Federal Trade Commission's ability to police unfair and 
deceptive practices provide a backstop, large policy gaps around 
access, security, and privacy exist, which confuse both individual 
consumers and businesses. Because the FTC is prohibited from using 
traditional rulemaking processes, the agency has developed a ``common 
law'' of privacy and security through its enforcement actions.\2\ 
Creating proactive privacy rights through an episodic approach will not 
be able to keep up with advances in technology and the explosion of 
device and app manufacturers.

Privacy and Data Security Legislation Pending in December 2019
    Despite repeated criticism that Congress had not moved on privacy 
legislation, this Committee as well as other committees of jurisdiction 
have held meaningful hearings over the last year. The chair, ranking 
member, and several other Commerce committee members have introduced 
legislation on comprehensive privacy legislation or some piece of the 
bigger picture. Below are a number of key issues and discussion of how 
they can be addressed in legislation.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ CDT focuses here on proposals authored by Chairman Wicker and 
Ranking Member Cantwell. CDT will have additional analysis on issues 
not addressed here, time permitting. Legislation by Committee members 
Thune, Blunt, Fischer, Blackburn, Blumenthal, Schatz, Markey, 
Klobuchar, and Peters all include important principles or language that 
can contribute to the final bill.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scope of legislation
    Covered entities. It's crucial that any comprehensive privacy law 
cover all private sector entities that collect, use, and share personal 
information.\4\ This includes not only the prominent tech companies 
that have captured our attention recently, but also not-for-profit 
entities and the communication providers that are currently under FCC 
jurisdiction for privacy and security enforcement. Creating a single 
Federal standard will ensure that individuals can rely on the same 
baseline rights as they move across the digital ecosystem. To that end, 
Chairman Wicker's staff discussion draft \5\ is one of the more 
comprehensive proposals.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ We do not have a final recommendation as to whether HIPAA, 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley, FCRA or other existing consumer privacy laws should 
be reformed and made consistent with comprehensive proposals. CDT 
generally supports updating those laws, but Congress should move 
forward in the currently unregulated space if addressing financial 
services, health care and other sectors becomes an impasse.
    \5\ STAFF OF S. COMMERCE COMM. CHAIRMAN WICKER, STAFF DISCUSSION 
DRAFT (2019) available at: https://aboutblaw.com/NaZ (hereinafter 
WICKER DISCUSSION DRAFT).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We also recommend that legislation not categorically exempt small 
businesses.\6\ They may collect, use, and share data in many of the 
same ways as larger entities.From the perspective of an individual 
consumer, the harms they experience are not mitigated because a company 
has fewer customers or makes less money. A privacy law that is clear 
and reasonable need not put an undue compliance burden on smaller 
entities, and many of the provisions in the bills authored by Chairman 
Wicker and Ranking Member already meet that test.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ Pending proposals that define small businesses as those with a 
small number of users are more meaningful than previous iterations that 
focused solely on income or number of employees. These latter two 
metrics do not have a bearing on whether certain data harms will be 
deeply or widely felt by users. Ideally, a bill will borrow from the 
FTC's current guidance that focuses on number of users (5,000) and 
minimal data processing practices. FED. TRADE COMM. REPORT, PROTECTING 
CONSUMER PRIVACY IN AN ERA OF RAPID CHANGE: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 
BUSINESSES AND POLICYMAKERS 15-16 (2012).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If the Committee feels that some procedural requirements are too 
much for a small business to comply with, legislation should adopt the 
Wicker staff discussion draft approach and exempt smaller entities from 
specific requirements. For example, it is more important that small 
businesses meet data security requirements, offer opt-ins, avoid 
discrimination, and provide access, correction, and deletion rights. It 
is less important that they conduct broader risk assessments, have 
certain staff members, or provide in depth reporting on their data 
practices.
    Covered data. It is also important that legislation cover all 
personal data even if the Committee decides that there may be tiers of 
sensitivity that warrant different substantive requirements. We 
strongly recommend that the committee define covered personal 
information consistent with current FTC guidance which is best 
reflected in Ranking Member Cantwell's draft bill as ``information that 
identifies, or is linked or reasonably linkable to an individual or 
consumer device, including derived data.'' \7\ The additional qualifier 
that this data ``can be used on its own or in combination with other 
information held by, or readily accessible to, the covered entity'' \8\ 
as proposed in the Wicker staff draft may be overly restrictive. 
Distinguishing between data that is linkable and that which is not 
serves two purposes. First, to discourage first parties from 
unnecessarily associating information with real people, but second, to 
offer down stream protections when information is shared with 
affiliates, third parties, or even in the instance of a data breach. 
These additional reasons for storing and using data in de-identified 
format will be frustrated by a definition that so heavily focuses on 
first party linkability.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Corporate Responsibility
    The core of any privacy and security law must be corporate 
responsibility. While we should respect the rights of individuals to 
control their data, any systemic change will have to come from the 
entities that collect, use, and share data themselves. While a new law 
will have to regulate businesses of varying sizes, business models and 
data uses, there are some requirements that can be imposed across the 
board to ensure individuals receive digital civil rights that do not 
require them to micromanage the relationships they have with companies. 
All of the components of corporate responsibility are contained in the 
bills introduced in the Senate to date and only need to be stitched 
together to provide meaningful consumer protection.
    Data use. Both Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member Cantwells' bills 
begin to address the exceptionally hard question of whether and how to 
regulate the use of data beyond any opt-in requirement. The FTC 
continues to develop a body of common law to prohibit certain data uses 
on a case by case basis, but a Federal privacy law can and should go 
one step further to categorically prohibit some of the riskiest data 
uses.
    Data use limitations exist to some extent in Chairman Wicker's 
minimization section \9\ and Ranking Member Cantwell's loyalty 
section.\10\ The committee could also borrow from legislation sponsored 
by Senators Blunt and Schatz on facial recognition technology \11\ and 
Senator Markey's comprehensive privacy bill.\12\ Ultimately, data use 
limitations must go beyond limiting data use to what a company says it 
will do with data, to creating an objective limitation regardless of 
what any one privacy policy entails. While there are a number of ways 
to craft this, a clear purpose limitation on sensitive data will make 
great strides towards aligning consumer knowledge and expectations with 
corporate behavior. To the extent that some provisions peg data use to 
what a company believes is a ``reasonable'' consumer expectation, they 
may be subject to bad faith arguments or protracted litigation about 
what exactly a ``reasonable consumer'' is.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Artificial intelligence and civil rights. Both bills recognize the 
importance of providing oversight of artificial intelligence programs 
and reinforcing longstanding discrimination laws that may be undercut 
by current data practices. Despite their differences, we hope this 
signals a commitment to addressing these issues in any final privacy 
and security legislation. CDT prefers the breadth and depth of Ranking 
Member Cantwell's approach and looks forward to working with the 
committee on refining these requirements as necessary as the 
legislation moves forward.
    Data security. CDT commends Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member 
Cantwell for including data security requirements in their draft bills. 
Close to half of U.S. states do not have a general purpose data 
security law, and FTC enforcement under its Section 5 authority will 
always be limited to what its resources allow. We recommend combining 
the two and adding one additional provision.
    First, the committee should adopt Chairman Wicker's base text in 
section 204 regarding the requirements of a reasonable data security 
program. Second, the committee should adopt Ranking Member Cantwell's 
scoping of data to be covered. Her draft protects not only sensitive 
information, but all personal information. Because both bills impose a 
reasonableness standard that will peg to the size and complexity of the 
organization and the sensitivity and use of the data, it is unnecessary 
to exempt certain data sets from the overall security requirement. 
Third, this section should provide overall rulemaking for the FTC. 
Right now, the Wicker and Cantwell bills require guidance or limited 
rulemaking, but it is time for the longstanding guidance of the FTC to 
be written into regulation. To the extent that some in the corporate 
sector have criticized the FTC's data security requirements as too 
vague despite long-standing guidance in this space, they will benefit 
from having regulations on the books to better describe requirements.
Individual rights
    Both the Wicker and Cantwell drafts offer meaningful individual 
controls to individuals and we commend the comprehensive approach 
contained in them.
    Opt in requirements for sensitive data. Both bills include a 
comprehensive list of sensitive data that is subject to affirmative, 
express consent. The differences are minimal but the definitions should 
be amended in a few key ways. First, the committee should adopt an 
expansive definition of health information, and we recommend borrowing 
from CDT's model legislation \13\ which incorporates not only data that 
reflects a person's mental and physical status, but data that is 
processed for health or wellness purposes. As Senator Klobuchar and 
Murkowski recognize in their Protecting Personal Health Data Act,\14\ 
apps, wearables, and devices are creating and collecting intensely 
personal information that can be used in ways that greatly affect a 
person's mental and physical well-being. Any definition should ensure 
that these resulting data sets receive heightened protection.

    Second, sensitive data should include Ranking Member Cantwell's 
formulation of ``information revealing online activities over time and 
across third-party website[s] or online services.'' \15\ This 
formulation is meaningfully different from the type of data that will 
be regulated by ``Do Not Track'' functions the FTC would facilitate 
under either proposal.\16\ We understand this to mean data collection 
that is more pervasive and intrusive than first party tracking or one-
off identification of an individual which arguably deserve less 
protection. This formulation is also consistent with Senator 
Blackburn's BROWSER Act \17\ which has long recognized the unique place 
at which edge providers sit in the ecosystem. While all entities should 
play by the same set of rules, recognizing that long term tracking of 
this data is particularly risky for privacy and security is consistent 
with the overall approach of the bills.

    Product development exception. In general, the list of exceptions 
to the opt-in right contains reasonable data use that is core to 
offering the product an individual signs up for. They fairly recognize 
that some data processing is absolutely necessary to offer safe and 
effective products and cannot be opted out of either individually or at 
scale. However product development as listed in Chairman Wicker's staff 
discussion draft is meaningfully different from the rest of the data 
uses. It permits companies to collect data without someone's consent 
even if they have no understanding of how it will be used or whether 
they will benefit from the use at some point in the future. Since 
product development is solely for the benefits of the companies who 
collect the data--unlike everything else on this list of exceptions--it 
should not be done without an individual's consent. To the extent the 
Committee does not want to inhibit innovation, it should further 
explore why the de-identification carve out is insufficient for product 
development, and whether some middle ground should be created for 
processing data this way.
    Access correction deletion portability. The individual controls are 
comprehensive. Our only suggestion is that the Committee include the 
timelines drafted into Wicker's staff discussion draft to ensure that 
rights are afforded on a reasonable timeframe.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \18\ WICKER DISCUSSION DRAFT, Sec. 103.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Data broker registry. We commend the Wicker staff draft for 
including a data broker registry housed at the FTC.\19\ A registry will 
ensure that individuals can discover and exercise their rights against 
data brokers who have amassed incredible amounts of sensitive data on 
the average American. While many of the provisions in both the Cantwell 
and Wicker drafts may slim down the amount of information that 
eventually ends up in data broker databases, these entities are likely 
to continue collecting information and will still be holding data that 
has been accrued over decades of largely unregulated data use. That 
someone can exercise their access, correction, and deletion rights 
against these entities is the best protection against future data 
abuse.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \19\ Id. Sec. 203.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enforcement
    Both Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member Cantwell's drafts include 
meaningful enforcement mechanisms, but they differ in a few important 
ways.
    First, Ranking Member Cantwell includes a private right of action 
(``PROA'') for all violations of the law.\20\ CDT believes a targeted 
private right of action is necessary for meaningful enforcement. This 
is not only because the number of entities that will be swept under new 
regulations will necessarily dwarf the resources of the FTC and state 
attorney generals, but because our history is full of instances where 
government actors simply did not have the wherewithal to be first 
movers on important social issues. Because private litigation has 
served such an important function in civil and consumer rights 
enforcement in the past, it should be reserved in some form in Federal 
privacy legislation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \20\ COPRA, Sec. 301(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It is important to note that all 50 state unfair and deceptive 
practice laws include some form of a private right of action, even if 
substantially limited.\21\ If a privacy bill seeks to categorically 
move privacy and data security out of these laws,\22\ it should ensure 
that consumers are at least equally positioned to defend their rights 
as they are now.

    \22\ While California has a general purpose privacy law, and some 
states have targeted regulation like Illinois' Biometric Information 
Privacy Act, privacy law is overwhelming homed in state UDAP statutes 
at present. Similarly, roughly half of states do not have express data 
security requirements, so enforcement against unreasonable data 
security falls under UDAPs too. NAT'L CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATURES,

research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/data-security-
laws.aspx.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The proper balance likely lies between the Cantwell and Wicker 
drafts in a specific delineation of what provisions can be enforced by 
PROA and under what conditions. State and Federal laws are full of 
examples where PROAs are crafted to limit litigation to the most 
important harms. We recommend that the Committee consider this approach 
to find the right way to maximize accountability and minimize nuisance 
litigation. Such litigation controls could include opportunities to 
cure, harm requirements, reduced or nonexist damages or prior agency 
review, for example. We look forward to working with the Committee 
further on finding the right way forward on PROAs.
    Second, legislation should allow state attorneys general to bring 
cases in state court and should not force consolidation of cases into 
the D.C. Circuit. Courts at every level are backlogged and funneling 
enforcement into too few courts will greatly delay meaningful defense 
of consumer rights.
Conclusion
    CDT thanks the Commerce Committee for the opportunity to testify 
about privacy legislation today. We are encouraged by the many 
thoughtful proposals already introduced in the Senate and believe that 
passing a single comprehensive privacy and security law should be a 
priority for committee action in 2020.

    The Chairman. Well, thank you to all five of you for some 
very good testimony and some, I think, very helpful 
suggestions. Let's get right to some of the unresolved issues 
between my draft and the Ranking Member's draft. And so, let me 
just pick up with you, Ms. Richardson. Your group issued a 
draft privacy legislation last year that does preempt State 
data privacy laws. Why did you do that? I think everyone can 
see how that is a benefit to private industry, retailers, 
convenience stores, Internet service providers, technology 
companies. How does it benefit consumers to have a nationwide 
standard?
    Ms. Richardson. So, I think there are a couple of things 
here. One is that the first privacy bills we are seeing at the 
State level are not very comprehensive. The law in California 
for example is both historical, we want to recognize that, but 
it is not complete. It is mostly an opt-out law and many of the 
proposals before the Committee now are actually stronger. So 
there is an opportunity here to actually do better than what we 
are seeing at the states.
    But second, I want to point out it took 15 years for all 50 
states to eventually pass breach notification and that is a 
very narrow issue. I am concerned that if we have to go state 
by state to cover everyone in this country with a privacy law, 
we are going to be on the next version of the internet. So 
there are benefits to consumers if we can get a really high 
standard at a Federal law now.
    The Chairman. Ms. Ohlhausen, how would this benefit 
consumers nationally?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. So, as it has already been mentioned, 
consumers' rights need to be clear. They need to understand 
them, and they need to know how to enforce them. And having a 
uniform Federal standard will allow consumers wherever they are 
in the U.S.--you know, the Internet is as an interstate entity, 
wherever they are purchasing, wherever they are transacting or 
engaging in a service, those same rights will follow them.
    So I think that gives them an enormous benefit to now have 
with a detailed comprehensive set of rights like both of your 
proposals or the numerous proposals provide that this will 
allow the consumers wherever they work, wherever they travel, 
wherever they are transacting business to understand what those 
same rights are and to have them available to them.
    The Chairman. OK. Ms. O'Connor, Ms. Richardson believes 
that the proposals that I have outlined and Senator Cantwell 
and some of her colleagues have put forward are much stronger 
than the California law. I agree with that. Do you agree with 
that? And it is important to note that the California 
legislature looked at amending their law, chose not to expand 
the private right of action, for example. So could you please 
comment on those issues?
    Ms. O'Connor. Thank you so much for that question, Senator. 
In fact, we are scrambling to be ready for the January 1 
compliance date at Walmart in California. And to echo what has 
already been said, simply adding more complexity to consumers' 
lives is not actually I think helping their privacy. There is 
strength in clarity, simplicity, and consistency that could be 
offered at the Federal level.
    If a consumer in one state is certain that they are going 
to get the same rights and same value from their data that a 
consumer in another state--let me give you an example actually. 
On Thanksgiving weekend, I sent my sister the Woodwick Frasier 
Fir Candle. It is a great little candle. I recommend it highly. 
It is on Walmart.com. It is green. It is a perfect holiday 
gift. It makes a little crackling sound. She lives----
    The Chairman. How much was it?
    Ms. O'Connor. It was $24.99. Thank you--for the oval shape. 
It is great. I bought four of them for myself, only one for 
her, but that is another story. She lives in New Jersey. I 
purchased it on Walmart.com using my cell phone within the 516 
New York area code. I live in Maryland. It is shipped from--I 
don't actually know which warehouse. We are based in 
Bentonville, Arkansas and our e-commerce site mostly use--our 
service out of California. Which State law applies to that 
transaction? Whose data is going to be protected? Her data, my 
data, the transaction data? Where does it happen? This is not 
helping our consumers' understanding, our average everyday 
consumer transactions, simplicity, efficiency, and speed.
    So I have always believed, in all of the roles I have had 
in the four privacy officer roles I have held in the private 
sector and two in the Federal Government and my time in civil 
society, that a comprehensive Federal standard is the right 
answer for the American citizen.
    The Chairman. OK. Well, we have a lot of issues to get to, 
but thank you very much, and my time has expired.
    Senator Cantwell.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, thank you 
to the witnesses. I am going to try to go fast because there is 
so much to cover but all your testimony was so helpful. I just 
want to clarify if I could just on quick yes-no answers, if you 
do believe in a consumer privacy rights writ large, that we 
should say that their rights and that those rights should be 
enforced somehow depending on how? Just say yes.
    Ms. Brill. Yes.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes.
    Ms. Moy. Yes.
    Ms. O'Connor. Yes.
    Ms. Richardson. Yes.
    Senator Cantwell. OK. And several of you mentioned harmful 
data practices are people for specifying the harmful data 
practices and that consumers should be protected against 
harmful data practices?
    Ms. Brill. Yes.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes, with an understanding that consumers, 
you know, may have different preferences.
    Ms. Moy. Yes.
    Ms. O'Connor. Yes.
    Ms. Richardson. Yes.
    Senator Cantwell. OK, go back. Ms. Ohlhausen, what do you--
different preferences? Either there is harm--I mean harmful has 
to be determined, right?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Harmful has to be determined, but for 
example at the FTC when we did look at things like substantial 
injury did the consumer, or could the consumer have avoided it? 
Consumers can sometimes make different types of choices where I 
may not want to share information, but someone else, my 
neighbor may feel more comfortable sharing that information. 
Having an understanding that consumers also may have somewhat 
different preferences.
    Senator Cantwell. OK, let's go to something maybe a little 
harder and I apologize Ms. O'Connor. I should have come up with 
some--my team should have come up with somebody that wasn't 
here today. But on Walmart, this is just an example, we all 
know that people put up a general privacy statement. They 
basically say something like--well, actually I saw a statistic 
like that. I don't know what it was, 70 percent of companies 
now share data with third parties, and it is just standard part 
of their privacy statements.
    But on your website, I think you have a privacy statement 
that basically says, yes, information might be shared. But now 
with Ghostery you can actually see--just hold it up Melissa. 
Just hold it up. Ghostery can now show you an actual tracking 
of how many different people are tracking that data. So 19 
different advertisers are taking that data that you generally 
said here is what is, you know, in our privacy statement, which 
you have to read.
    OK, but now we know by using that app that 19 different 
people were tracking that data and information. So our concept, 
at least my colleagues and I here are saying, you should be 
more upfront about that. That is just a little too vague on 
what is happening to information and data. So where are the 
witnesses on what we should do about this so that there is 
clarity to consumers?
    Ms. Brill. Yes, so this is actually a really important 
question, and of course the California law focuses on giving 
users the ability to opt-out of sharing with third parties. And 
a number of the proposals that various committee members have 
pulled together also focus on what is happening with respect to 
sharing with third parties.
    Senator Cantwell. OK. I am going to run out of--so, do you 
think we should be more explicit with consumers than just we 
are sharing information with a third party? Do you think they 
should list the names or list the companies, or what data is 
being shared so that----
    Ms. Brill. So I think focusing only on third--forgive me 
for interrupting. I think focusing only on third parties is not 
business model neutral and will have competitive effects that 
are unintended but will be severe.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. We are in favor of increased transparency 
for consumers but in a way that is not overwhelming. So if they 
want more details they can get it or if they just need general 
types of third-party sharing that would also be available.
    Ms. Moy. I do think third-party sharing is a huge problem. 
And it is impossible for consumers really to know where their 
data is going. I think one of the things that I see in the 
draft bills is that the rights, when consumers exercise their 
rights, those rights would have to be communicated to 
additional parties and exercised by them, and I appreciate 
that.
    Ms. O'Connor. Thank you so much, Senator, and thank you for 
using our website, which actually we are very proud, and we 
have worked on. I have a tremendous team in Bentonville and in 
San Bruno in Sunnyvale, California. Most of what you saw in 
your ghost research is likely online tracking that we do of 
ourselves to see who is coming to the website, how long they 
are staying, better service you on a return visit so that as 
you probably note when you leave and you have got something in 
your basket, it should hopefully still be there when you 
return. I don't believe any of those, and I will certainly 
follow up with your team and staff and my staff as well, are 
sharing personally identifiable data about our customers. And 
let me be just really clear, we do not sell or lease personally 
identifiable information about our customers outside of the 
Walmart family.
    Senator Cantwell. Well, and we want to hear from Ms. 
Richardson about whether this is the practice writ large that 
we have to get to figure out what we can do and what consumers 
are doing--Ms. Richardson, I think I know your answer because 
you said in your testimony, you should just be able to say no, 
don't do this.
    Ms. Richardson. Yes. We would support limitations on third-
party sharing.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I 
could go into a bunch of AI questions, which I really have, 
because I really do think that what we are discussing today is 
really, really important. But I guarantee you tomorrow's 
challenges are going to be much more significant and we have to 
figure out how to get something in place to help us deal with 
that for the future. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Cantwell.
    Senator Thune.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA

    Senator Thune. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding today's 
hearing. As members of this Committee continue to work on 
crafting a national consumer data privacy bill, it is my hope 
that we can ultimately work together on a bipartisan basis to 
produce legislation that puts consumers interests first while 
still allowing the private sector to innovate and grow the 
economy.
    I think all of us understand, or at least should, that only 
a bipartisan proposal has a chance of clearing the Senate and 
becoming law, and in my view, that bipartisan outcome must 
include strong consumer protections while also avoiding the 
regulatory patchwork that is beginning to emerge at the State 
level.
    I remain committed to working with the Chairman, the 
Ranking Member, and our colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to find a consensus solution. Since we started privacy 
discussions last Congress, I have said the consumers are 
entitled to clear and concise explanations of how the services 
they use are collecting and using their data.
    In one specific area where I believe consumers deserve more 
transparency and control is with respect to how Internet 
platforms use artificial intelligence and opaque algorithms to 
make inferences from the reams of data collected about all of 
us that too often result in users being caught in a so-called 
``filter bubble.''
    The filter bubble is essentially the unique universe of 
information generated on an Internet platform for each user. 
Many users are unaware of the filter bubble. That is why I have 
introduced the bipartisan Filter Bubble Transparency Act which 
would give individuals a greater understanding of how Internet 
platforms use algorithms to increase user engagement.
    You would also give consumers the option to engage with a 
platform without being manipulated by opaque algorithms powered 
by the user's own personal data. And I am proud to have 
Senators Blumenthal, Moran, Blackburn, and Warner as co-
sponsors of this bill. At the same time, whether it is 
algorithm transparency or privacy, I understand that bills 
touching on highly technical issues can have potentially 
unintended consequences. So I welcome constructive feedback on 
this bill and the Committee's efforts more generally.
    I would like to ask, if I might, a couple of questions 
relating to transparency on Internet platforms as well as the 
larger privacy debate. And the question for each of you is 
regarding the Filter Bubble Transparency Act. It is more of a 
general question, but you would agree that it is appropriate to 
give consumers more information and choice about how 
sophisticated algorithms and artificial intelligence are often 
selecting what the consumer sees on Internet platforms? And I 
would just like it if you can quickly comment on that.
    Ms. Brill.
    Ms. Brill. We think it is a very important issue. We are 
very grateful that you have raised it and we look forward to 
discussing it with you further, how this could be implemented.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. We are certainly in favor of giving 
consumers more transparency about how their data is used and 
how that shaped what they see.
    Ms. Moy. I absolutely think so. I think you know--and many 
platforms optimized for engagement and that optimization can 
have unintended consequences. One of those certainly as you 
mention is the filter bubble which drives political 
polarization. We also see this driving the spread of 
misinformation and disinformation and also discriminatory 
advertising. And for all of those reasons, I think we need 
action on this issue.
    Ms. O'Connor. Yes, Senator, we are supportive of the intent 
of the bill.
    Ms. Richardson. Yes, we support the more transparency and 
accountability for how AI is used.
    Senator Thune. OK. Ms. Brill, Ms. O'Connor, aside from 
California at least a dozen other states are in the process of 
enacting consumer data privacy laws. What impact would a 
diversity of State privacy laws have on your respective 
companies? And then as a follow up to that, apart from the 
compliance challenges for companies, are there concrete 
benefits for consumers to having a common national standard, 
assuming that it is robust?
    Ms. Brill. Thank you for that question. Microsoft believes 
that we do need robust privacy laws in the United States, 
including laws that will be protective of consumers and provide 
greater consumer rights as well as greater responsibilities on 
companies. To the extent that states are enacting laws, they 
are I believe spurring a great conversation in the United 
States about the need for more privacy protection.
    So we applaud what the states are doing. Having said that, 
at some point in time, if we do have 50 State laws that start 
to conflict, it might be one thing for a company like Microsoft 
to be able to comply with it, but many, many of our customers 
and millions of other companies might have much more 
difficulty. So conflicting State laws could end up being 
problematic down the road, but we do applaud the states for the 
work that they are doing because we so desperately need privacy 
legislation in this country.
    Ms. O'Connor. Thank you, Senator. I would certainly echo 
what has already been said and simply note that a complexity of 
State laws can have a chilling effect on the consumers' comfort 
level with a company with which they are doing business. They 
could have greater certainty and clarity and understand the 
transactions that they are entering into with a single Federal 
standard. Our customers shop across state lines not only on the 
Internet but in the physical world as well, and we want them to 
be protected wherever they shop.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Ms. O'Connor. My time is up. I 
would ask consent that I be able to have a letter included in 
the record from the Privacy for America Coalition.
    The Chairman. Without objection.

                                        Privacy for America
                                                   December 3, 2019

Hon. Roger Wicker,
Chairman,
Senate Commerce Committee,
Washington, DC.

Hon. Maria Cantwell,
Ranking Member,
Senate Commerce Committee,
Washington, DC.

Dear Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member Cantwell:

    Privacy for America \1\ applauds your leadership for holding this 
week's hearing and your ongoing interest in protecting consumer data 
privacy. We share your interest and want to bring to your attention 
that, today, Privacy for America released a comprehensive new framework 
for nationwide privacy legislation that would fundamentally change the 
way consumer privacy and security are protected in this country. We 
hope the framework, which expands and builds upon principles released 
in April, will advance policy discussions and help build the consensus 
necessary to enact bipartisan data privacy legislation this Congress.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Privacy for America is a coalition representing industry, 
including the advertising industry, with members from virtually every 
sector of the economy. The steering committee includes leaders from the 
4A's (American Association of Advertising Agencies), ANA (Association 
of National Advertisers), Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), IAB 
(Interactive Advertising Bureau), and NAI (Network Advertising 
Initiative).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The framework represents a new approach to data privacy that would 
not rely on the current 'notice and choice' model, which presents 
consumers with endless and complex privacy notices that they are 
essentially forced to accept if they want to participate in today's 
economy. Instead, this new approach clearly defines and would make 
illegal data practices that would harm consumers or otherwise make 
personal data vulnerable to breach or misuse, while preserving the 
benefits that come from the responsible use of data and ensuring the 
economy can grow and innovate. This new paradigm shifts the burden away 
from consumers and toward a common set of privacy norms, backed by 
strong enforcement to ensure accountability by the businesses and 
organizations that use data every day.
    This framework offers a detailed new approach with robust 
protections for consumers and clear penalties for companies that do not 
comply. In addition to enumerating prohibited data uses, Privacy for 
America's new paradigm includes several additional provisions that 
together constitute a comprehensive privacy framework. Among the 
framework's provisions are:

   Prohibitions against using consumer data to determine 
        eligibility for a job, health care, financial aid, insurance, 
        credit or housing outside of existing laws governing 
        eligibility for these important benefits;

   Prohibitions against discrimination by using consumer data 
        to set higher prices based on an individual's race, color, 
        religion, sexual orientation, and more;

   Prohibitions against using sensitive information like 
        health, financial, biometric, and geolocation data without 
        first obtaining users' express consent;

   Provisions protecting so-called ``tweens'': a vulnerable 
        group of consumers over age 12 and under age 16 that is 
        actively engaged online but not often subject to constant 
        parental oversight;

   A requirement that companies make privacy policies much 
        easier to read and understand;

   Provisions that give consumers the right to request access 
        to and deletion of the personal information that a company 
        holds about them, as well as the right to port certain data 
        from one platform to another;

   Individuals can choose to limit companies' use of personal 
        information to draw detailed inferences or make predictions 
        about them, with certain exceptions; and

   Significant new rulemaking authority, resources, and staff 
        that will allow the Federal Trade Commission to more 
        aggressively pursue and punish bad actors, bolstered by 
        enforcement by state attorneys general.

    Again, Privacy for America applauds your leadership, and we look 
forward to continuing our work with you and other leaders in Congress 
to see comprehensive Federal data privacy legislation enacted.
            Sincerely,
                                           Stuart P. Ingis,
                                                           Counsel,
                                                   Privacy for America.
cc: All Members of the Senate Commerce Committee

    Senator Thune. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator Blumenthal, you probably don't have 
any questions----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Am I incorrect there? Senator Blumenthal.

             STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT

    Senator Blumenthal. Thanks. Mr. Chairman, and thank you for 
having this hearing, and thank you to our Ranking Member as 
well. We have a lot of bills, but we have no Federal law. I 
want a law. There will be more bills, and I can tell you, may 
be no surprise to any members of our panel, but here is a 
bulletin from outside the beltway. People are angry and scared 
more than ever before and they don't care whether it is a 
Federal law or a State law. They want a law. And you will see 
State laws all around the country.
    Hopefully, they won't create too much inconsistency, but 
that is where we are going if we fail to act. And the reason 
that they are angry and scared is that they feel rightly this 
data belongs to them and they are losing control over it. They 
want that control back and they want a means of enforcing the 
law.
    I agree completely with my colleague Senator Cantwell in 
emphasizing enforcement. That was pretty much my professional 
career for all the years that I was a prosecutor and trial 
lawyer before I came here. And I believe strongly in private 
Attorneys General even though I was an Attorney General before 
I came here. We know that consumers should be able to protect 
their rights in court when State or Federal agencies fail to do 
it for them.
    So let me ask Ms. Moy and Ms. Richardson, do you agree that 
if we preempt State laws and create this Federal standard, that 
we have to allow private enforcement to ensure that the Federal 
standard provides the remedies that they have under those laws?
    Ms. Moy. Absolutely, and I would say that there needs to be 
some agility mechanism too to continue updating the standards.
    Ms. Richardson. Yes. We recommend it would be targeted at 
the most important offenses though and material harms, but yes, 
we would support one.
    Senator Blumenthal. And let me ask all the members of the 
panel. I am assuming that you would agree with me that any 
Federal law should add to the rights that consumers have, 
enforceable rights, not take them away. Anybody disagree? And 
that means for example in the California law and the Illinois 
law where there are private rights of action, we should 
preserve them in some form. Correct? Everybody seems to agree?
    Ms. Brill.
    Ms. Brill. The California private right of action is 
actually a fairly limited private right----
    Senator Blumenthal. It is a limited one, but still we don't 
want to take it away, we want to add to it.
    Ms. Brill.--I do believe in a Federal law. We need to focus 
on consumer redress, and I think there are lots of ideas about 
how to do that. I am not certain that I would agree that all of 
those mechanisms that exist in all the states should be added 
upon in a Federal law.
    Senator Blumenthal. Would you agree that there should be 
some provision for injunctive relief to stop ongoing harm?
    Ms. Brill. Yes. I do think that injunctive relief of having 
individuals have the ability to obtain injunctive relief is 
important. I also think it is important to require companies to 
have a process internally so that if someone is seeking their 
data or wants to delete it or correct it and they are not 
satisfied with the initial decision about that access right, 
they have ability to escalate that within the company as well. 
An administrative process, if you will.
    Senator Blumenthal. And I hope that you and other members 
of the panel would be willing to work with the Committee to 
devise a standard that preserves that kind of right.
    Ms. Brill. Absolutely. I look forward to working with the 
Committee on that.
    Senator Blumenthal. I would like to ask Ms. Moy and Ms. 
Richardson, is the FTC really likely to bring a lawsuit in the 
majority of consumer complaints that deserve action? Would you 
want to trust only the FTC?
    Ms. Moy. I think it would be really problematic to rely on 
the FTC alone. If you look at the very strong, or the strong, 
children's privacy law that we have, COPPA, that law has been 
in existence for over 30 years and there have been only--I am 
sorry, over 20 years, and there have been only 31 enforcement 
actions in that time. And in that time, some of those that have 
violated it, violated it for years before an enforcement action 
was brought.
    And that is because we are talking about an agency that 
really only has 40 people working on these issues. That is not 
enough. And as I said before, if a State AG is only able to 
bring--you know, the California State AG which has a large 
staff was only able to bring three or four privacy prosecutions 
a year, we are going to need a greater force multiplier than 
that.
    Ms. Richardson. I think that is correct. There are going to 
be so many new entities swept under this law and new rules that 
enforcement and clarifying exactly what is expected of 
companies is going to take a lot of actions. And there is just 
going to be cases where small groups of people are affected in 
small states that will never become a national enforcement 
priority. And that is where State AGs need to be able to 
protect their own constituents.
    Senator Blumenthal. My time has expired, but I just want to 
thank all of you for being here today. And I do want a law not 
just a bill, and a law isn't going to happen unless it is 
bipartisan. That is why I am working with a number of my 
colleagues, most prominently Senator Moran, and we have been 
for some time. These issues are not easy, but we have a 
responsibility to address them. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Blumenthal. Senator 
Fischer.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DEB FISCHER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA

    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It might not be 
the most exciting but a key consideration as we look to the 
data privacy really, I think, comes down to definitions. The 
nuances and defining covered data and what constitutes data 
collecting, selling, and processing all have major impacts for 
industry and consumers alike.
    Ensuring these are clear and consistent in U.S. law will be 
fundamental to a unified Federal privacy framework. 
Commissioner Ohlhausen, if we were to multiply definitional 
differences by up to 50 states and force companies to map out 
which states have the same terms, similar terms, or dissimilar 
terms, what does that potential world of compliance look like?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Thank you, Senator, for your question. I 
think that it is a world that is very confusing for consumers, 
and it is costly and confusing for companies as well to know 
what their obligations are and how to comply with them across 
many, many hundreds of definitions for similar behaviors.
    Senator Fischer. In particular, how would this affect any 
new entrants into the market who are looking to innovate? 
Wouldn't it be closed off almost?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Right. Absolutely. It is one of the things 
that we have seen documented post GDPR. While GDPR certainly 
has some very good provisions, it has affected small and medium 
enterprises who are not able to comply and who have just simply 
withdrawn from the market.
    Senator Fischer. Do you think that the friction of these 
differences could possibly help serve to further entrench our 
big tech companies?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Absolutely. In anti-trust terms we call it 
raising rivals' cost. It can be away for--a path for big 
companies who have the resources, who have access to, you know, 
lawyers and people to do all of this for them. They have an 
advantage.
    Senator Fischer. A lot of times when we talk about the 
importance of consent for consumers, we do have to center on 
data privacy, and the legislation that we have seen from both 
the Chairman and the Ranking Member, there is language that 
both products seeking to ensure that affirmative express 
consent--and that is clearly given.
    However, too often we have a lot of online platforms that 
are manipulating how users interface and that weakens that 
consent product. Users are going to see a false choice that is 
presented to them on the screen and they press the ``I agree'' 
button. These scenarios hide what the action actually does such 
as accessing your contacts, your photos, your location, your 
messages, your web activity, on and on.
    Commissioner Brill, can a privacy framework involving 
consent function effectively for consumers if it also does not 
ensure that UI design presents fair and transparent options to 
manage personal data settings?
    Ms. Brill. Thank you so much for the question, Senator. It 
is very important that to the extent that consent is required 
that it needs to be surfaced to users in an immersive and very 
easy mechanism so that consumers can really understand what 
their choices are and have real choices.
    Of course, consent is an important component of any privacy 
law, but requiring only consent or relying on only consent 
really places much too much of a burden solely on individuals 
to govern privacy in this country, which is one of the reasons 
why we think it is very important and we applaud all of the 
work on both sides of the aisle to build into the draft 
frameworks that we are looking at a focus not just on consent 
and choice by individuals, but also placing real 
responsibilities on companies to ensure that they are using 
data responsibly and appropriately.
    Senator Fischer. I have introduced a bill with Senator 
Warner, The Detour Act, which Microsoft has been supportive of 
and I thank you for the input and the feedback that we received 
on that. Do you think that we have to have a Federal data 
privacy vehicle that would address this issue as well, to be 
able to get the Detour Act as part of that, that that is going 
to be necessary, I think, to really have a direct benefit that 
consumers will see immediately?
    Ms. Brill. It is a very important issue and we look forward 
to working with you on how to build those concepts into 
whatever vehicle moves forward. Absolutely.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you very much.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Fischer. I would at this 
point remind Members that we have a series of three votes 
beginning at 11:30 a.m., three cloture votes. And what we are 
going to try to do is just continue the question and answer as 
Committee members alternate back and forth.
    Senator Schatz.

                STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN SCHATZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII

    Senator Schatz. Thank you to all of the testifiers. This 
has been a great hearing so far. I want to zero in on something 
Senator Fischer was talking about which is notice and consent 
and choice and the ability to opt out. Now, here is my view. My 
view is that consumers effectively have no choice because: (a) 
they are going to be asked to make these choices, to agree to 
privacy policies multiple times in a day; (b) these things are 
just too long. They take 10 minutes to read.
    I think the Facebook policy takes an average of 18 minutes 
to read. And then finally, an educational attainment 
requirement of college plus. I think the Airbnb policy has a 
readability score that requires the educational attainment 
equivalent of a doctor or a lawyer and it takes 10 minutes to 
read. And then I will just add one final thing which is in an 
IoT universe and an AI universe, we have got multiple sensors 
pinging off of your body, your phone, your wrist, and 
everything else.
    The idea that you are going to daily opt out of the world 
is preposterous. So I will just start with one very simple yes 
or no question, and I will start with Ms. Brill and move down 
the line. Do you think that Facebook and Airbnb users know how 
their data is being used?
    Ms. Brill. Without focusing on any particular company, I 
think navigating the current ecosystem of privacy statements is 
very difficult and we need more immersive----
    Senator Schatz. I will take that as a diplomatic no.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Schatz. Ms. Ohlhausen, in the interest of time, I 
will take a no.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Right. I think that----
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Ohlhausen. I think that most users probably don't, but 
some do, and some people who are very immersed in this do 
surface problematic privacy provisions.
    Senator Schatz. Sure. Ms. Moy.
    Ms. Moy. No.
    Senator Schatz. Ms. O'Connor.
    Ms. O'Connor. Senator, we completely agree with the concept 
of a duty of loyalty that you so eloquently in imply in your 
drafts. You heard it in my original testimony. We feel like we 
have a duty of care to our customers in all sorts of ways. So, 
and I am sorry to go on, but I think once called myself the 
Mark Twain of privacy policies because I have written more 
words that nobody has ever read online and offline, so I think 
in the interest of our busy working families that our 
customers, we need to be efficient and clear in our 
disclosures.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you.
    Ms. Richardson. I will just say no.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you very much. So, do you--just down 
the line. I will start with Ms. Richardson. Do you agree that a 
strong privacy law must prohibit companies from using the data 
that they collect in ways that harm users?
    Ms. Richardson. Absolutely. I think when we look at Mr. 
Wicker's bill and Ranking Member Cantwell's bill, they are the 
gold standard of what consent looks like when it works right, 
but where we could do more is buildup the other side of that 
equation and put more obligations on companies.
    Senator Schatz. Right. This is belt and suspenders. I mean 
part of the reason for a duty of care and a duty of loyalty is 
the difficulty of empowering consumers as a practical matter. 
The other part of this is that it is impossible, even with all 
these smart people, to enumerate and specify and ban future bad 
actions 15 years from now when this statute is still hanging 
over an IoT and AI universe, and we don't know what kind of bad 
stuff companies are going to do. It is going to be very 
difficult to predict them in a bill that we are going to write 
next year. I am sorry, who am I on? Is it Ms. O'Connor? Thank 
you.
    Ms. O'Connor. I think you were looking for a yes.
    Senator Schatz. Yes.
    Ms. Moy. Yes. I agree completely. That is why I would 
appreciate that at least some of the drafts have rulemaking 
authority for unfairness--I am sorry, for harmful data 
practices as well.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Drawing on the FTC's unfairness standard 
which looks at substantial injury but also balances it with 
consumers' ability to make these decisions as well if they have 
the right amount of information, I think that is a useful model 
to look to for any legislation.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you.
    Ms. Brill. Yes, and we are deeply encouraged by the fact 
that both drafts on both sides of the aisle have concepts 
around avoiding harm, and that is very important.
    Senator Schatz. Ms. Brill, I want to stay with you for a 
moment and talk about the FTC's authorities. First, fine 
authority, rulemaking authority, and staffing. Can you give us 
your quick recommendations there?
    Ms. Brill. We need first-time fining authority. I believe 
rulemaking authority is important, especially as these bills 
are going to be complex, and in the United States many of these 
concepts will be brand new and millions of companies will need 
more guidance. So I think rulemaking authority guidance 
workshops are all going to be very important. And staffing, 
couldn't agree more that the FTC is deeply understaffed in this 
area in particular.
    Not only are the British data protection authorities and 
the Irish data protection authorities much better staffed, but 
if you look across Europe, it is hundreds of people in each 
country dealing with privacy issues. We definitely need many, 
many more people in the FTC and also more technical expertise. 
They have technical expertise. They are great, but we need to 
build that up.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Schatz. Senator Moran.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JERRY MORAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM KANSAS

    Senator Moran. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Thank you to the 
Ranking Member for having this hearing and thank you to our 
panelists for joining us. Ms. Brill, thank you for the time you 
spent with me and my staff yesterday. I will start with you, 
Chairman Ohlhausen. Hello. Nice to see you again. With the 
recently adopted California Privacy. Act, Consumer Privacy Act, 
which was slated to take effect, is slated to take effect this 
year, this next year, I assume we would agree that it is going 
to influence what other states will do and there is concern 
expressed by some, many about a patchwork of standards across 
50 or more states.
    How are--the California law preempt municipalities like San 
Francisco and Los Angeles from adopting their own privacy 
requirements for companies. The California legislature made 
clear it didn't want a patchwork of municipal level privacy 
laws. How is this approach any different than what Congress 
would be pursuing if we preempt a patchwork of State laws?
    Ms. Brill. Well, I think it certainly shows the need and 
the appreciation of having a uniform standard for all consumers 
in this market, and so I think that would be very consistent.
    Senator Moran. It interests me that already in California 
there is CCPA 2.0. Again, somewhat trying to combat the 
uncertainty different standards. But even in California, if you 
were preparing for a law to be enacted to take effect next 
year, there is at least contemplation that that law is going to 
be something different already. And so even within California, 
not only is Los Angeles and San Francisco preempted from their 
own, but also there may be a different statute around the 
corner as well. Let me do what my colleagues have done and ask 
all of you for a ``yes or no'' answer.
    Understanding that there is stakeholder interest in 
establishing a uniform Federal framework that consumers can 
count on, no matter what state they live in, it is fair to say 
that such a framework will need substantively or at least 
strong policy and resource components included in order to 
provide meaningful privacy protection to consumers while also 
gaining necessary bipartisan support for possible enactment of 
Federal law.
    Let me highlight what Senator Blumenthal says, we have 
bills and I am pleased that the Ranking Member and the Chairman 
have introduced legislation but ultimately the Senate requires 
60 votes and finding that, threading that needle to find the 
place, is a conversation that I think we as Senators have to 
have, what are we willing to accept to have something different 
than what we are going to have without Federal legislation.
    So trying to find that bipartisan support and I would 
commend Senator Blumenthal for his tenacity and efforts to 
accomplish that goal, and I have appreciated the chance to work 
with him as well as Senator Wicker and Senator Cantwell and 
Senator Schatz and Senator Thune. That being said, do you think 
it would be appropriate to include the following components in 
a pre-emptive Federal privacy bill? Standardizing--this is the 
first option. Standardizing specific transparency requirements 
along with consumer controls and rights that will allow 
individuals to access, delete, or correct their personal data 
handled by businesses?
    Ms. Brill. Yes, that would be a critical component of any 
strong Federal privacy law.
    Senator Moran. Thank you.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes.
    Ms. Moy. For sure, that would be included.
    Senator Moran. Thank you.
    Ms. O'Connor. Yes.
    Senator Moran. Thank you.
    Ms. Richardson. Yes.
    Senator Moran. Thank you. Providing the FTC first time 
civil penalty authority?
    Ms. Brill. Yes.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes.
    Ms. Moy. Yes.
    Ms. O'Connor. Yes.
    Ms. Richardson. Yes.
    Senator Moran. Providing the FTC targeted rulemaking 
authority that will ``future-proof'' legislation without 
undermining the measurable certainty of the statute?
    Ms. Brill. Yes, rulemaking authority will be necessary.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes, targeted rulemaking.
    Ms. Moy. With the caveat that we may define targeted 
differently, yes.
    Ms. O'Connor. What she said.
    Ms. Richardson. Yes.
    Senator Moran. Thank you. Establishing new FTC 
authorizations for appropriations to address the resources and 
staffing needs of the agency?
    Ms. Brill. Absolutely.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes.
    Senator Moran. Ms. Ohlhausen, I would ask you to go beyond 
yes. Based upon your previous experience, what resources--what 
is the level, the nature of the change that's necessary?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. So I do think the FTC needs substantially 
more resources. Its entire budget is only slightly over $300 
million and that is for both missions. So I think it needs the 
ability to hire personnel. It needs finances, the ability to 
have experts, and the additional powers that a statute might 
provide like first time civil penalty authority, increased 
authority over certain entities, and the ability to create a 
redress fund that can repay consumers directly and promptly. I 
think all those are very, very important strengthening pieces 
for the FTC.
    Senator Moran. Thank you. Ms. Moy?
    Ms. Moy. Yes, absolutely.
    Ms. O'Connor. Yes.
    Ms. Richardson. Yes.
    Senator Moran. Mr. Chairman, this is my last yes or no 
question. Authorizing State Attorneys General to enforce the 
Federal standards and complement the FTC's enforcement efforts?
    Ms. Brill. Yes, that is very important.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes, and it has been something that has 
worked well in COPPA.
    Ms. Moy. It is a critical component.
    Ms. O'Connor. Yes, we support it.
    Ms. Richardson. Yes.
    Senator Moran. I would highlight, not that I am looking for 
the burden but I also appropriate for the FTC in addition to 
authorize for the FTC, and this is an important issue, I 
believe, for us to work out in authorization as well as in the 
appropriations process.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Moran.
    Senator Markey.

               STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD MARKEY, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS

    Senator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Children. For all 
of the panelists, do you agree that a comprehensive privacy law 
must include heightened protection for kids and for teens, for 
kids in our country under the age of 16? Do you all agree that 
has to be much stronger than for adults? Ms. Brill?
    Ms. Brill. Yes, and I applaud all the work that you have 
done in this area. Absolutely.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Agree with heightened protections.
    Ms. Moy. Yes and thank you for your leadership.
    Ms. O'Connor. Yes, and as a mother I can say the most 
important thing in my household.
    Ms. Richardson. Yes.
    Senator Markey. Thank you. I have introduced, you made 
reference to it, legislation with Senator Hawley to protect 
kids and teens privacy. The legislation is an update to the 
Children Online Privacy Protection Act, the COPPA law which I 
authored back in 1998. Our Markey, Hawley COPPA 2.0 bill 
revises COPPA's actual knowledge standard to a constructive 
knowledge standard so that websites that should reasonably know 
that kids are on the websites need to get consent in order to 
collect children's data.
    This is a much higher standard than exist today. Ms. Moy, 
can you quickly explain why a constructive knowledge standard 
will help protect children's privacy by stopping websites from 
turning a blind eye to the fact that kids are on their 
platforms?
    Ms. Moy. Absolutely, and this is really important to me. In 
addition to doing a lot of work on children's privacy, I have a 
6-year-old who recently got his first iPad and I have been very 
concerned. So yes, I think that currently under the actual 
knowledge standard we really do have an incentive problem 
because that is such a high bar. Some entities that should 
become subject to COPPA kind of have an incentive to instead 
frame their sites or services is a general audience and then 
look the other way about the fact that there are children on 
them.
    A constructive knowledge standard would impose a reasonable 
duty of care on sites and services to know that they probably 
have children on their site, and it also creates an objective 
standard. So because the actual knowledge standard is 
subjective and based on what the entity actually knows, it is a 
little bit difficult for outsiders and enforcers and academic 
institutions like ourselves to actually know what those 
entities know and don't know.
    Senator Markey. OK. So again, historically bad actors have 
targeted kids. Let us just be honest about it. It goes on today 
and we just need to heighten the protections. The legislation 
also bans targeted marketing to kids because companies 
shouldn't be creating profiles of eight-year-olds and 
bombarding them with ads. Ms. Brill, do you agree with a ban on 
targeting ads to kids?
    Ms. Brill. Absolutely. And Microsoft does not currently 
market to kids under 16. We think that that should be a rule 
across the Nation.
    Senator Markey. Ms. Moy, do you agree with that?
    Ms. Moy. Absolutely.
    Senator Markey. Do the others agree with that? Ms. 
Ohlhausen, do you agree with that?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. My recollection of COPPA is that it puts it 
in the hands of the parents to decide if they wanted to do 
that. So it is something I would certainly be interested in 
hearing more about.
    Senator Markey. But otherwise a ban in place. If the 
parents want a ban, would you support a ban?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Of course.
    Senator Markey. Do you agree with that Ms. O'Connor?
    Ms. O'Connor. Yes.
    Senator Markey. Ms. Richardson.
    Ms. Richardson. Yes.
    Senator Markey. The Federal Trade Commission recently 
reached a settlement with YouTube over widespread violations of 
COPPA. The Federal Trade Commission found that YouTube 
knowingly broke the law by tracking kids in order to rake in 
advertising dollars without the requisite notice to and 
permission from the parents. Ms. Moy, what did the YouTube case 
reveal about the corporate appetite for kids data online and 
the need to invest in enforcement or privacy laws?
    Ms. Moy. Thank you for the question. Yes. So as anyone with 
kids knows, if they drive a substantial amount of household 
spending, this action was in response to a complaint that was 
filed by the clinic that I now direct. And it really did show 
that the children are a lucrative target and that YouTube had 
been widely boasting its ability to reach children, to help 
advertisers reach children on the one hand, and then at the 
same time claiming that it was not a child-directed service or 
did not have child-directed portions of the service.
    Senator Markey. And again, it is like smoking or vaping. 
They got to get you young. They want to get you hooked young so 
we know that that is the business model and if we don't put in 
the protections, that they will try to do that. And I have 
called for the creation of a youth privacy and marketing 
division at the Federal Trade Commission, which would be 
responsible for addressing the privacy of children and minors 
and marketing directed at children and minors in our society. 
It is time that we just realize it is an exploitable market 
that doesn't have sufficient protections.
    And finally, Amazon Ring, connected to doorbells, Ring 
allows law enforcement to request the video footage from users 
doorbells, but Amazon's responses to a series of letters I sent 
revealed that Ring has no restrictions on law enforcement 
sharing users' footage with third parties and Ring has no 
policies that prohibit law enforcement from keeping shared 
video footage forever. And I was also disturbed that Amazon 
refused to commit that it won't sell users' biometric data that 
they gather.
    Ms. Moy, you have testified about the importance of data 
use limitations in any Federal privacy bill. Should those 
limitations include a ban on the sale of biometric information?
    Ms. Moy. You know, Senator, if your Social Security number 
is compromised, you can change it, but you can't change your 
body. And for that reason I do agree that that should be 
banned. There should not be a market for this information. It 
is too sensitive and there is no redress if it is compromised.
    Senator Markey. I agree with you and that should be in any 
privacy bill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Markey. Senator Blackburn 
is recognized, and Senator Blackburn will preside in my absence 
while I run, vote, and come right back.

              STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE

    Senator Blackburn [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and 
thank you for the Committee today and for each of you being 
here, and for participating in this hearing. I appreciated 
Senator Cantwell's remarks about it being an all-female panel 
and I think one of those reasons is because as I have talked 
with each of you over the last several years, this is a primary 
issue for women. They want to protect their virtual you and the 
virtual you of their children and protect that privacy online.
    And I think people are absolutely appalled that we have 
gone this long without having a Federal privacy standard. It 
was six years ago that we started the privacy working group in 
the House and to think that it has taken this long to move to 
this direction is really surprising. But I will say I am so 
pleased to see so many of the components that we have discussed 
through the years beginning to be points that people are 
coalescing around, things like a Federal preemption and a 
Federal standard, and guarding specifically that sensitive 
data, and making certain that we are not focused on delivery 
systems anymore, which is what used to be the standard.
    And I know Ms. Ohlhausen, you remember those conversations, 
but we are focused more on that in-use and beginning to put 
those protections that are in place as we look at artificial 
intelligence. And Ms. Moy, I appreciate your comments about 
that. I have got just a couple of questions I want to drill 
down on. Ms. Ohlhausen, I think I am going to come to you 
first. Let's talk about this using--about incumbents using 
privacy legislation as you said as a method for raising their 
rivals' cost.
    And as we look at keeping the Internet free and open and 
healthy, we talk about keeping it innovative. So as we talk 
about putting a privacy and data security framework and those 
guidelines in place, we don't want to do something that is 
going to embolden big tech and make competition more difficult 
for new entrants into the marketplace. So do you see a private 
right of action as a new tool that big tech could use to keep 
competition at bay?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Well, one of my concerns about a private 
right of action is that I think when you have a strong law, 
like what is being considered that gives the FTC additional 
resources, additional tools and empowers 50 State Attorneys 
General to bring these actions, that has a comprehensive and 
clear framework, a private right of action, I don't see how it 
gives consumers additional benefits----
    Senator Blackburn. Well, and TCPA taught us that the road 
to protecting consumers' privacy is many times paved with good 
intentions----
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Absolutely, Senator.
    Senator Blackburn. But very difficult and fraught with 
peril.
    Ms. Brill, any comment on that?
    Ms. Brill. We would be concerned that--we need strong 
enforcement. We have already talked about that. Strong Federal 
enforcement at the FTC, strong State Attorney General 
enforcement. We think that consumer redress is important, but 
we need to keep it targeted on what consumers actually need.
    And just to be clear, you know, Microsoft has a very 
different business model. We are focused on ensuring that our 
customers succeed. Some of them are very small, some of them 
need to reach the market, and we are concerned with how they 
will navigate a world where there are multiple laws that could 
be difficult for them.
    So in terms of though the private right of action, what we 
would like to see is ensuring consumers have redress where they 
need redress, and otherwise, we rely on Federal enforcement and 
State enforcement.
    Senator Blackburn. OK. And I appreciated your comments 
about State level efforts. And I do think that that is an 
indicator of how people are saying you all need to do something 
about this, because they no longer have the ability to protect 
themselves or feel they don't have the ability to protect 
themselves online. The other question I have, I am going to ask 
you all to submit in writing on this. I think we have come to 
the point that we agree, there should be one regulator.
    And in my opinion the FTC is the most qualified to be the 
regulator. They have that historic knowledge. But what I would 
like to see is in your perfect world, and each of you have 
looked at this for a long time, what should that look like? 
When you talk about the tools, when you talk about the ability 
to put those penalties in place and those enforcement and being 
able to address this.
    This is the new marketplace and it needs to be properly 
staffed and then conducting itself in the proper manner. And 
with that I will yield back, and Senator Baldwin, you will be 
recognized for 5 minutes.
    Senator Baldwin. I will yield--Senator Tester was here when 
the gavel----
    Senator Blackburn. OK. Senator Tester, you are recognized 
five minutes.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Senator Tester. Thank you very much. I want to follow up on 
Senator Blackburn's last point because I just want to make sure 
we are clear. Are you--and by the way, thank you for your 
testimony. Are you all in agreement that the FTC needs to be 
the regulator and that we only need one regulator?
    Ms. Brill. At the Federal level, yes. We agree it should be 
the FTC.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes, the FTC but allowing the State AGs to 
enforce to the Federal standard.
    Ms. Moy. I would want to see how strong the standards, how 
strong the mandate, and what the definitions are before 
answering that question definitively. I will say in general, it 
is always good to have more cops on the beat.
    Ms. O'Connor. We are in agreement that the FTC with the 
State AG.
    Ms. Richardson. Yes.
    Senator Tester. OK. And so the question because manpower--
because I think you have all addressed the issue that they are 
not staffed to the point they can be. Do any of you have any 
idea on what the numbers might be for additional staff? And I 
know we have touched on a little bit, but I don't know that we 
actually got to numbers. Do you have any idea on what they 
would need in addition?
    So 40 people are now working on, is that correct? They have 
40 people available?
    Ms. Brill. I have heard it is 40 to 60. It is a very--it is 
a paltry number compared to the task.
    Senator Tester. What do you think they need?
    Ms. Brill. I would say 500.
    Senator Tester. OK. Anybody else have anything they want to 
throw in? Is that where we need to end up at?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. I think going scaling up from 60 to 500 is a 
bit of a challenge. Somewhere in the middle and perhaps look to 
the FTC for the number----
    Senator Tester. So, I am looking at an ideal world not the 
real world. And in an ideal world, what do we need to have for 
people to be able to meet the needs out there in this 
particular area?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. One other thing I want to mention is it is 
not just having people, it is also resources, right. So if they 
need to hire experts because often in trial you need an expert. 
When I was the Chairman a big part of the spending was on 
experts.
    Senator Tester. OK. I got you. And I mean there is no doubt 
about that. Manpower, resources have to come with it. And I 
guess it is up to us to find out where those resources come 
from. I assume a self-funded agency is not part of the equation 
or should be part of the equation? Go ahead. You have been on 
this thing.
    Ms. Brill. Yes, and actually and we have seen criticism in 
the past decades of State Attorneys General that used resources 
to fund themselves. So I think that it is very wise to set up 
some kind of victim fund or redress fund, but I think 
appropriations is a better way to go.
    Senator Tester. OK, that is good.
    Ms. Moy. And if I can just offer the additional--I would be 
remiss not to mention that many have also advocated for an 
independent data protection authority. You know, so when you 
are talking about the possibility of hiring 500 staff to work 
on privacy, it is at least an idea that should be considered. 
But again, I think that it all depends on how clear the mandate 
is on privacy and how strong the authority.
    Senator Tester. Yes. And so--and Senator Schatz got into 
this a little bit on the consent. And I know the figures were 
thrown out that 4 out of 5 people don't think they have any 
control, and 4 out of 5 people think the risk outweighs the 
benefits. I am surprised that it is only 4 out of 5.
    I would think that it would be single percentages that 
actually know what their data is being used for. So the 
question I have, just when it comes to something basic like 
consent and how complicated it can be and how you really can't 
check out of the 21st century, how do we as policymakers make 
it so that those consent forms are understandable? Do we 
actually delineate that it has to be at a third grade level, or 
what do we need to do? Anybody can jump in on this by the way. 
Sure, go ahead. We are going to go to Ms. Richardson.
    Ms. Richardson. I would propose, you know, adopting the 
consent structure that has already been proposed by the 
Chairman and the Ranking Member. I think those are actually 
good examples.
    Senator Tester. They will function properly?
    Ms. Richardson. Yes, but I would say the most important 
thing to focus on is what is outside of notice and consent, 
what is so important that we just offer those people rights, 
regardless of what box they check, right. And that is a much 
harder task, but it is a worthwhile one to make sure that as 
people move seamlessly across devices and websites and 
services, that they have the same rights wherever they go.
    Any time used to rehabilitate notice and consent and the 
hundreds of relationships we have with companies, you know, 
focus instead on use limitations.
    Senator Tester. This is my opinion, but I mean, I think 
there is very little doubt that a patchwork system doesn't work 
very well. And I think that we can't expect anything but a 
patchwork system unless we come up with a law at the Federal 
level. But once we come up with a law at the Federal level that 
empowers the states be able to do the enforcement, I think that 
could be the best of both worlds. That is just my opinion.
    Are any of you guys lawyers? Good. We got a couple. So data 
that is used to harm users, that creates substantial injury. I 
am a farmer, OK, but is substantial injury defined within the 
code? Do we know what that is? Or is that something we are 
going to leave the FTC to define or should we define it? Go 
ahead.
    Ms. Moy. So, I think that the draft bill or the bill, I am 
sorry, would--it defines injury as including financial, 
physical, or reputational, right.
    Senator Tester. But to what level? I mean my reputation 
gets damaged every day in this job.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Moy. Right. And I think that this is one reason why it 
is really--so the FTC actually has a number of cases that it 
has enforced where it has defined some of these terms, but it 
has been difficult for the FTC to peg injuries that are not 
financial in nature to injury in the past. And I think this is 
one of the reasons that it is important to create the ability 
for the FTC to define what those injuries look like outside of 
financial wealth.
    Ms. Brill. You know, I will note that the----
    Senator Blackburn. The gentleman's time has expired.
    Ms. Brill. I am sorry.
    Senator Tester. Yes, we can get on to it later. Thank you.
    Senator Blackburn. Mr. Young.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. TODD YOUNG, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM INDIANA

    Senator Young. Thank you, Chairman. Since the recession, 
economic dynamism, business startup rates have been at least 
what is a modern era all time low, and as we approach, you 
know, the possibility of implementing somewhere here in the 
near term, a Federal data privacy standard, we want to make 
sure we don't exacerbate that trend. And something that my 
colleague, Senator Blackburn discussed a bit earlier about the 
threat of incumbents raising rivals' cost, she asked a couple 
of questions as it relates to the private right of action.
    But I would like to broaden the scope of that question a 
little bit and just ask each of you to discuss particular 
principles or provisions, if included in a national data 
privacy framework, that you believe would be harmful to new 
firms or small firms and startups? So what protections, to put 
it differently, should be left out or included in this standard 
for small businesses or future small businesses?
    Ms. Brill. One of the things I alluded to earlier in this 
hearing was a concern of an overemphasis on sharing with third 
parties. I absolutely agree and Microsoft agrees that there 
should be some disclosures around that, but we need to 
recognize that small businesses often need to rely on third 
parties. They don't have within their own structures a full 
soup-to-nuts advertising program, just as an example, or a full 
slate of the kind of data that they would need to reach 
consumers. So if we want to ensure that small businesses have 
the ability to reach consumers in the same way that some of the 
very, very large tech firms do, we need to recognize that those 
companies have to rely on third parties.
    And so if we overly burden the small companies through 
disclosures that they have to make about third parties when 
some of those third-party relationships are quite reasonable 
and would be expected by consumers, I think we are going to put 
our thumb on the scale of competition.
    Senator Young. Are you suggesting that maybe we should have 
different treatment at a certain threshold, either the size of 
business or sales or something?
    Ms. Brill. Both bills of both frameworks do have a small 
business exception. They function differently. What I am also 
suggesting though is we should focus on what companies are 
doing for processing of data themselves, not only how they are 
dealing with sharing of data. We need to look at large 
companies and what they are doing internally.
    Senator Young. Thank you. Ms. Richardson, I think you 
wanted to----
    Ms. Richardson. Yes. I think this is something that 
Chairman Wicker gets right. He exempts small businesses from 
the more process-oriented or procedural things, but still 
reserves, you know, individual rights, data security, and 
things that are more reasonable to ask small businesses to do, 
so we would recommend that approach as opposed to exempting 
them from the law altogether because they are collecting and 
using the same sorts of data.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. If you look at the FTC's 2012 privacy 
report, one of the things that it talks about is context and 
consumer expectations and permissible uses. So not requiring a 
lot of excess notification for things that companies just 
normally do and that consumers expect and that do have a high 
risk for consumers. So it would reduce the burden.
    Senator Young. So I heard earlier from Ms. Richardson this 
is something Chairman Wicker got right. Is there something in a 
separate piece of legislation or through a separate initiative 
we may get more right in order to ensure that small business 
development is neither constrained, perhaps even catalyzed?
    Ms. O'Connor. If I could call out the portability 
provisions in Ranking Member Cantwell's bill. We believe that 
obviously data is essential to competition and we would want to 
see consumer rights of access and portability used to promote 
the consumers interest in their own data and not to create 
unhealthy, you know, limitations on competition. Surprisingly, 
even though Walmart is a big company, we are in a sector that 
is highly, highly competitive and we are concerned about the 
weaponization or the misuse of a portability concept.
    Also, we are very supportive of and concerned about the 
legitimate uses of data such as disaster recovery or emergency 
operations that might not be enumerated in any of the bills, 
but that would be essential for small and large businesses 
alike.
    Senator Young. I may a follow up on that last point. Thank 
you much, Madam. I am basically out of time.
    The Chairman [presiding]. Senator Rosen, you are 
recognized.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JACKY ROSEN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Rosen. Thank you, Chairman. Well, I have to say as 
a former computer programmer, I look at this panel of women and 
it just warms my heart, and so for all the young girls out 
there that I hope might consider watching C-SPAN----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Rosen. This is the hearing they should be seeing, 
and you are the role models that are there for them. And so I 
thank you for your important and hard work to get where you are 
and have this very important conversation because we need to 
have a common core of privacy protections accountability 
requirements because business has to operate across all 50 
states, across the global market. Protecting the rights of our 
individuals, of ourselves, you are not only advocating for your 
business or for the Government, whatever it is, you are also a 
consumer, a person, a family member.
    And so this discussion about how we talk about the work 
side of us, the professional, the business, the marketing and 
also the personal side of us and where that intersects, this is 
really at the core of these privacy discussions. And so I want 
to--I am going to submit some questions about disaster 
recovery. I know a little bit about that from my prior work, 
but today I want to talk a little bit about cyber and data 
security.
    As Ranking Member Cantwell alluded to, data breaches have 
created a record pace in 2019. Over 4 billion records, 4 
billion, exposed in the first half of this year alone. And for 
the sake of time I don't have to talk about the cost not just 
to industry but personally to people.
    The loss of trust is also large for businesses, for 
individuals. Where are the trusted sources? What do we do? It 
is critical to all of our success. But large businesses still 
only spend a very small part of their IT budgets on 
cybersecurity, typically between 16 and 14 percent, and small 
businesses who face major financial consequences without the 
wherewithal that large businesses have, often less.
    And in Nevada, although you think of us as large casinos 
and all those kinds of things, 99 percent of businesses in 
Nevada are small businesses--99 percent. And so data security 
for the growth of our state, our longevity, and our integrity 
for those small businesses that support our industry is really 
important.
    So to everyone on the panel, what do you think the biggest 
impediments are to businesses taking action before the breaches 
happen? And as we look at it through the lens of regulation, 
how can we incentivize and empower the businesses large and 
small to take their data security seriously, protecting that 
consumer data thus protecting their own self-interest, I think, 
in the long run.
    Is it through incentives, guardrails, a combination of 
both? What do you think we can do, because really when those 
breaches happen, the loss of goodwill for all of us is big. 
Will I shop again at that store? Will I do XYZ? Or not to 
mention small businesses going out of business at a large rate. 
Thank you. Please.
    Ms. Brill. Well, one of the things that I think is 
important to recognize--first of all, thank you for your 
question. It is an incredibly important question. One of the 
things that I think would be helpful to recognize is that 
requiring companies to provide data subject rights, to provide 
consumers with access to their data just as an example, or the 
ability to delete their data if they ask, that has an 
incredible effect inside a company. If you are required for 
each and every one of your consumers to know where that data 
is----
    Senator Rosen. So you think that will help against 
breaches, is this what you are talking about?
    Ms. Brill. What I am saying is, it creates a great deal of 
hygiene within a company around the data that you have. It 
causes companies to say, gee, there is a bunch of data I don't 
need. I am going to delete that data. And it really focuses a 
company on what is the data I need because I am going to need 
to provide that data to a user when they ask for it. That in 
and of itself is very helpful hygiene, so that if there is a 
breach, you are really only talking about data----
    Senator Rosen. So limiting vulnerability and exposure?
    Ms. Brill. You have greatly reduced the surface area of 
exposure, yes.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Senator, thank you for your question. I 
think having the kind of approach that we have seen in these 
proposed bills that require entities to understand and explain 
what kind of data they have, why do they use it, with whom do 
they share it, brings forward as Commissioner Brill said, it 
surfaces these concerns, so they have to deal with them and 
then make those decisions.
    I think one of the other things that is really beneficial 
in these bills is giving the FTC this clear authority in this 
area to make companies understand their accountability for 
safeguarding the data. I think that is very, very key here. I 
also liked how Senator Wicker's bill looked also to the NIST 
framework, which is a process based. So that is also very 
useful even for a small business to consider.
    Ms. Richardson. And Senator, I would say only about half of 
the states right now have State level data security laws of 
general applicability. So including it in a Federal privacy law 
will cover much more people. I would say we would take what is 
in the Wicker and Cantwell proposals but also give the FTC 
general rulemaking authority for data security.
    I think we know exactly what they are going to do. They are 
going to take their guidance that has been available for many 
years and write it into regulation and it is very good. It 
scales for different sizes and types of businesses and getting 
that on paper about what is expected of them will go a long 
way.
    Senator Rosen. Well, because the data that you all keep is 
the data that the hackers want. And so there is the tension.
    Ms. O'Connor. Thank you, Senator. The efforts that large 
and small businesses are making to defend their systems and 
protect the privacy and security of their customers' data is 
very significant. And so we would be supportive of a particular 
Ranking Member Cantwell's suggestion that there be a reasonable 
standard and that there should be enforceability. There is no 
privacy without good security.
    Ms. Moy. Yes, and I would agree with others that rulemaking 
authority in this area is critical and giving the FTC greater 
resources and rulemaking authority will help make the standards 
clearer. For businesses, I also agree that data minimization is 
an important component, but I think it is very clear to all of 
us that we need to apply data security standards to companies 
of all sizes because it is no consolation to a consumer that 
the data that was breached about them was breached by a small 
company as opposed to a large one.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much. Thank you, Senator 
Rosen.
    Senator Sullivan.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DAN SULLIVAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Sullivan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to 
echo Senator Rosen's comments about the panel here at the 
outset. As a father of three daughters, I think it is very 
impressive and a great example. I hope my girls are watching C-
SPAN, but they are probably not so----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Sullivan. I will tell them about this hearing 
though, but it is impressive. So thank you for the example you 
are setting and really important testimony you are providing on 
a really important topic, but a complicated topic. And I think 
you see it in the competing bills and a number of ideas, so I 
want to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member for holding 
this important hearing and working through legislation. So a 
couple topics I wanted to raise.
    You know, we have some big companies represented here, but 
one of the things I always worry about when you look at major 
regulations or a continuing patchwork of regulations across 
state lines or enshrining a private right of action is that 
those are issues that big blue chip companies can probably 
handle, but we also want to be able to make sure we are doing 
is creating an environment where the innovation that drives our 
economy, particularly in this sector, continues to flourish.
    And by that, I mean the ability of small businesses, 
startups, to create jobs, create economic dynamism, and I worry 
about some of the proposals here that yes, the big guys could 
handle it, frivolous lawsuits or patchwork, but what we really 
want to do is continue to create economic dynamism in this 
sector in a regulatory approach that keeps the incumbents in 
power and gives them more authority to deal with these kind of 
regulations or private right of action, could really stifle the 
next innovative American company. Can you can--I just wanted to 
throw that out there. I think it is a really important topic 
and I am not sure that the next startup, we don't even know who 
it is, or the next great idea, is not represented at this 
panel.
    Ms. O'Connor. Senator, if I could offer an answer. Even 
though we are, again, one of your biggest companies in almost 
every state, I think every state in the Union, one of the most 
amazing things I have seen in my brief time at Walmart is open 
call. And the hallway and home office in Bentonville where 
little tiny one and two-person company come in and try to sell 
their stuff to us.
    And it is just really inspiring and remarkable because it 
is kind of the American dream. I want to get my things on the 
shelves or online, and we want to work with those companies and 
see them flourish as well. They are our partners, our vendors, 
our suppliers, and a complicated standard will not help those 
companies thrive and it will not help their customers either. 
So we very much agree that a simple clear standard that is 
applicable to all.
    Senator Sullivan. And one frivolous lawsuit could crush a 
company like that.
    Ms. Brill. Microsoft has--we have got millions of customers 
and many of them are very small. We also have some of the 
largest customers, but we do well when our customers do well, 
so we are often speaking for small businesses, medium-sized 
businesses, legacy businesses, as well as new startups and very 
agile businesses. And one of the things I have said earlier, 
and I worry about is, when you have a brand new law that is 
going online in the United States for the first time affecting 
sectors that have never had to deal with this before, what we 
need to start out with is clear regulatory guidance, rules, 
workshops guidance.
    Let the ecosystem of small businesses, medium-sized 
businesses understand what their responsibilities are before we 
throw them into court right away with large potential damages. 
That is going to hurt, as you just said, largely these very 
small businesses as well as medium-sized businesses for whom 
this is brand-new as well.
    Senator Sullivan. Let me ask Ms. Brill or Ms. Ohlhausen, if 
we don't have a private right of action, which I am very 
skeptical of, what kind of improvements to FTC authority or 
resources would we need to make sure that as you are developing 
national standards, that they are enforced?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Thank you, Senator. I think the FTC needs 
more resources, both to hire staff, but also tools that it can 
use through the legislation such as first-time civil penalty 
authority for violations, the ability to get a consumer redress 
fund so that it can pay out redress quickly and promptly to 
consumers. The FTC has long asked for authority over a common 
carriers too. I think that could be a useful tool for the FTC. 
And so those are some of the kinds of both finance and 
authority tools the FTC should gain.
    Ms. Brill. And I agree with that list. I would add in the 
resources category, the FTC has wonderful people on its staff, 
but they need more. And they need technical expertise. They 
need lawyers. They need just more individuals. Earlier, I 
mentioned that I thought the ideal number would be 500. I think 
some eyebrows went up but there is a reason for it because when 
I look around the world, and Microsoft does have the pleasure 
and privilege of being able to see what is happening elsewhere 
in the world, most data protection authorities for much smaller 
companies are much better staffed than the FTC.
    And when you try to do it on a per capita basis, I mean, it 
really gets scary when you see the really paltry resources that 
the FTC is able to devote to this issue. On a per capita or per 
company or any measure that you might want to choose, the FTC 
does need to scale up very quickly if a law like this gets 
passed. Frankly, they should do it anyway because of the 
urgency of dealing with these issues, but I think the resources 
is probably one of the most critical issues.
    Senator Sullivan. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Who on the panel did not get to talk about 
the effect on innovation? I know Ms. Richardson, I would 
appreciate you helping us with Senator Sullivan's question 
about the effect on small innovators and startups.
    Ms. Richardson. I would say when we speak to entities that 
represent small businesses, even sole proprietors and VC fund, 
what we always hear is that small actors need clarity. They can 
design to what they need to do, but they just need to know what 
the rules are without hiring lawyers or going through extensive 
tests and balancing equities. So to the extent that we do have 
a law that can be readable on its face and people understand 
what is expected of them, that is going to benefit startups.
    So we would encourage Congress to go that way. And I am 
skeptical of safe harbors, but to the extent that we are 
talking about one, that might be an avenue to you know, 
discourage the worst behavior but give people some room to use 
data.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Lee.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE LEE, 
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM UTAH

    Senator Lee. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to 
dive back into the issue that one of my colleagues raised a 
little while ago about the concept of consumer harm in this 
area. For example, one person might regard the collection of 
his or her data as harmful, as a harm in and of itself. Another 
person might find it very helpful because it might help 
companies help that customer, that consumer, get more quickly 
to where he or she wants to go.
    And so it is sometimes easy to lose sight of this. There is 
a difference between the collection of data and the fact that 
some people might find that creepy, some people might find that 
as a form of harm in and of itself, and something like a data 
breach, a willful release of private data information or 
something like that. They are two different things. So let's 
start with you Commissioner Ohlhausen. I assume I can still 
call you that, right?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes. Thank you.
    Senator Lee. How would you characterize the harm or injury 
that we are focusing on here or that we ought to focus on here 
that consumers experience through the collection or transfer of 
their data as opposed to the breach of their data?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Thank you, Senator Lee. Consumers do have 
different preferences and that is why it is important two fold. 
One, to draw the lines between sensitive and non-sensitive data 
carefully to capture generally how most consumers feel about 
whether it is sensitive or harmful or not. And then to have the 
appropriate opt-in or opt-out. So you would have to opt-in for 
collection and use of your most sensitive data and then opt-out 
for non-sensitive data. And I think that best reflects what 
consumers want, which I think is ultimately the goal of the 
bill, or any legislation in this area which should be 
reflecting consumer choices and preferences.
    Senator Lee. So in that respect, should be we be focusing 
on an injury as opposed to a comprehensive effort to regulate 
data generally? Is that a better approach?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Well, I think in some ways it is kind of 
pursuing both because having a clear set of rights for 
consumers so that they know if something goes wrong or if they 
want to change how their data is being used or collected or 
shared, how they would have that information and that ability 
to do that. So we continue to give them that control in an 
ongoing way.
    Senator Lee. OK. Let us apply some of that logic to some of 
the debate that we need to have about whether to provide a 
private right of action. If it is difficult for us to 
articulate in the abstract the harm or the injury that 
consumers might experience in connection with data collection, 
shouldn't we also raise questions about whether or not a 
private right of action here would be able to satisfy the 
Article 3 judicial ability requirements in such a way that the 
plaintiff could establish standing?
    Ms. Ohlhausen. I do think standing for privacy violation 
has been certainly a difficult legal issue. It has been one of 
the benefits of having Federal enforcement. For example, the 
COPPA law and then enforced by the State AGs. It gets around 
that kind of problem.
    Senator Lee. It is certainly possible that the lack of 
defined harm or injury attached to that could cause problems, 
whether Article 3 problems or policy problems. It could render 
a subject to abuse.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes, I agree.
    Senator Lee. Ms. O'Connor, I would like to turn to you 
next. With respect to both the CCPA and the GDPR, we have seen 
a fair amount of confusion with regard to compliance and some 
complications with regard to what data might be covered and 
what data might not be covered. There are many who point out 
that this can be a very good thing for market incumbents who 
have been able to get there and establish an army of compliance 
specialists in advance, but that it might chill startups.
    There are some further consequences that could flow from 
this. What are some of the unintended consequences that we 
might face if Congress defines the concept of data in a vague 
or broad manner that leaves people in doubt?
    Ms. O'Connor. Thank you so much for that, Senator. And as I 
said before, we are striving mightily as a company to be ready 
on January 1 for the California Consumer Protection Act, and it 
has been a very significant allocation of time and resources 
and human capital. And we have the wherewithal to do that. Not 
every company----
    Senator Lee. You are a small company, right?
    Ms. O'Connor. Right, we are a very tiny little company. No 
one has heard of us.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. O'Connor. And we are absolutely trying to do the right 
thing, but we have issues with the California law and of the 
expansive definition of sale. And you are absolutely right, 
some lack of clarity doesn't serve business well, but it 
certainly doesn't serve our customers well either. And so 
clearly defined, clearly scoped definitions and resources and 
consequences are I think the right way to go.
    Senator Lee. Thank you. Thank you very much. I see my time 
has expired. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to each of you.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Lee.
    Senator Baldwin.

               STATEMENT OF HON. TAMMY BALDWIN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN

    Senator Baldwin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking 
Member, and to all of our witnesses today. At our last hearing 
on data privacy, I noted that my belief that most of my 
constituents really don't differentiate between a company's 
decision to use their data or give it to others in ways they 
didn't expect or agree to, and a company's failure to keep 
their data safe and secure from third-party criminals who want 
to steal it.
    At that same hearing, Dr. Hartzog urged us to hold 
companies accountable for being good stewards of users' data, 
meaning that they do, in his words, everything within reason to 
protect us from hacks and data breaches. So I am pleased to see 
that the proposals that are under discussion today really do 
tackle the issue of data security.
    Ms. Richardson, I wonder if you could elaborate on how 
aspects of these bills might get us to the right answer on data 
security. And do you think they provide the framework that will 
make companies good data stewards? And if not, how else can we 
ensure companies are taking every reasonable step to keep 
consumers' data secure?
    Ms. Richardson. Thank you, Senator. Yes, we think the bills 
make huge strides forward and they are defining the universe of 
activities that companies need to take to protect data. The 
good news is there is much more agreement about what is good 
data security than there is about what is good privacy, right.
    When you look at the NIST framework, the FTC, the Small 
Business Bureau, it is all, you know, coalescing into the same 
list of behaviors and it is everything from updating your 
systems to training your staff to deleting data you don't need 
anymore. So I think this is all encompassed in the bills that 
were looking at now. We would just encourage that there are 
general purpose FTC rulemakings. They would take those 
principles and clarify what that means for businesses of 
different sophistication and sizes.
    Senator Baldwin. Thank you. Ms. Moy, there are many ways in 
which data collection and use practices could have 
disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations, as you 
mentioned in your testimony, including women, racial, ethnic, 
and religious minorities, the LGBTQ community, people with 
disabilities, older individuals, and others.
    I believe that both data use restrictions and affirmative 
civil rights protections can help mitigate these potential 
negative impacts, and I am pleased that the ranking member's 
proposal and a number of other bills by others on and off the 
Committee include these types of measures. Could you discuss 
how the proposals before the Committee speak to protecting 
vulnerable populations? Do they go far enough, and are there 
other ways we should seek to prevent discrimination in a data 
privacy measure?
    Ms. Moy. Thank you so much for the question. This is 
really--I think that this is a really important issue as I 
highlighted in my remarks. So, just to give a few examples, 
information about consumers has been used not only to target 
advertisements for things like housing, employment, and credit 
in discriminatory ways, but also to target political 
misinformation and disinformation at certain classes of people.
    Also to target voter suppression efforts at certain classes 
of people. There is a lot that is potentially harmful. I think 
that in particular the bill that the Ranking Member has 
introduced in addition to outright prohibiting use of personal 
information for discrimination, which is key, also would force 
companies to take steps to determine whether or not 
discrimination is likely to occur on the on their platform 
based on their use of data.
    I think that is really important because I think that 
without a provision like that, that requires that type of 
assessment to take place in advance, at times there may be an 
incentive, an unfortunate incentive, for companies not to 
develop the knowledge that discrimination is taking place on 
their platform so as to avoid incurring liability for that 
discrimination. And so I think forcing prospective awareness of 
it is really critical.
    Senator Baldwin. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Baldwin. Senator Cantwell 
has some follow-up questions.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know our 
second vote, I think, did just start, so I will try to be quick 
and if the witnesses could help me. Another kind of yes, no 
answer on the first part. And that is, you know, as we are 
talking about what is sensitive data and information, is facial 
recognition sensitive? Yes, if you can just yes.
    Ms. Brill. Yes.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. I don't think the Coalition has a position 
on that. Yes.
    Ms. Moy. Yes.
    Ms. Richardson. Yes.
    Senator Cantwell. That was a yes, Ms. O'Connor?
    Ms. O'Connor. Yes.
    Senator Cantwell. OK, thank you. OK, then on, you know, one 
of the things we have tried to do is clarity. Obviously because 
predictability is an important thing. Where do you think it 
leads the colleagues that I have joined with in putting out a 
draft? Where do you think that stands as it relates to GDPR and 
in comparison? How do you view that as far as you know clarity? 
Obviously, if it was enforced the way it was enforced or what 
have you?
    Ms. Brill. One of the issues that I look forward to working 
with you and the Chairman on is ensuring that the provisions 
that you have put in place do not unintentionally favor some 
parties over other parties. I think there is a bit of a thumb, 
unintentional, on the scale in terms of favoring very large 
firms that are soup to nuts, can just surface ads to users 
without having to share with third parties. Again, 
unintentionally so----
    Senator Cantwell. That is the same problem with California 
today.
    Ms. Brill. Absolutely.
    Senator Cantwell. Very big problem. Listen, we are not even 
to have a free media in this country if we continue to persist 
in not clarifying those and we won't even control any of our 
content that we see because they will have all the money and 
they will plan all the content and then they will have all the 
advertising.
    Ms. Brill. I think that is an issue with the California law 
as well. I agree.
    Senator Cantwell. Yes, so we don't want that, but related 
to GDPR.
    Ms. Brill. Your proposal as well as the Chairman's proposal 
have embraced a great many of the concepts in GDPR that I think 
are going to be helpful for users and in particular what is 
very encouraging to see is that both proposals, both yours and 
the Chairman's, focus on user control and the real kind of data 
subject rights that you see in GDPR subject to the absence of a 
right to object to first-party processing. That is the piece 
that would help with this competition issue. And you also have 
some of the accountability measures like data minimization. 
Very important to require accountability on the part of 
companies as well. And we see that in GDPR too.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes, I think that both proposed bills 
provide more clarity. I think there is some ambiguity in GDPR, 
and I also think it less onerous as my colleague Julie Brill 
pointed out, on small and medium businesses.
    Ms. Moy. Yes, and I agree that I think that the adopting 
the rights framework is a really important thing that both 
frameworks do similar to some of the rights that are expressed 
in GDPR.
    And then I would also just mention that in terms of 
clarity, again the rulemaking authority is really critical 
there so that if there are issues that cannot be encoded in the 
statute at this moment in time because doing so might make the 
law less flexible to accommodate changing technology in the 
future, that an agency could do so in the future.
    Senator Cantwell. Ms. O'Connor.
    Ms. O'Connor. There are many companies that have quibbles 
with GDPR but the one thing you can say about it is it is done, 
and it applies to everyone in Europe. And so----
    Senator Cantwell. Do you prefer that over what we have been 
talking about this morning?
    Ms. O'Connor. No, no. That is not at all my point. Simply 
that a Federal standard is where we want to go because it will 
provide certainty for all consumers.
    Ms. Richardson. And I think your bill is definitely clearer 
than GDPR. I would say areas that I think might be subject 
either to litigation or exploitation in the future or anywhere 
that a bill references like a reasonable user, if we do not 
have guidance about what Congress thinks the reasonable user 
is, I see that being a problem where if it is, you know, 
substantial harm that isn't defined. So to the extent we can 
get even deeper on some of those issues, I think that will 
provide better protection for consumers and predictability.
    Senator Cantwell. Yes, I was looking at a much broader 
thing, but this is very helpful. So thank you. So do you think 
that is a better approach than GDPR or no?
    Ms. Richardson. Yes. For the U.S., absolutely.
    Senator Cantwell. OK. That is the main thing, and yes, that 
is the whole point. The more clear we can be, the more 
predictability we can have here. But yes, it means having 
definitions and it means having real enforcement and yes, a lot 
of these things. I have enjoyed this discussion because we are 
very involved in putting anti-manipulation standards into both 
the FERC and the CFTC and the FTC.
    And you know, a lot of people are like, no, you can't do 
it, you can't define manipulation. Well, I guarantee it we have 
collected hundreds of millions in fines against companies that 
have manipulated starting within Enron, electricity markets, 
and now other energy markets. And people have called it, you 
know, started out as a little acorn and has turned into a 
mighty oak because people knew what manipulation was. And so 
hopefully they will understand what harm is too and so I 
appreciate that everybody has supported harm today. Thank you, 
Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Cantwell. I want to drill 
down on broad APA rulemaking authority versus targeted 
rulemaking authority. And you are probably aware that the 
current Chairman of the FCC testified before the House Energy 
and Commerce Committee recently, and when asked if Congress 
should give the FTC broad APA rulemaking authority? He 
answered, ``please do not do it, do not give us broad 
rulemaking authority. Give us targeted rulemaking authority.''
    So help us understand this and help the public understand 
our choice in this regard. And I guess we will just start down 
here and whoever would like to participate in this question.
    Ms. Brill. Thank you so much for the question. I understood 
the Chairman's comments to mean don't sweep the FTC into 
general APA rulemaking authority, but rather allow the FTC to 
write rules when a specific law is enacted. I would--I 
interpreted Chairman Simon's remarks to indicate that with 
respect to a law like COPPA or with respect to a law like the 
ones that we are currently discussing, the bills and the 
frameworks, that he would probably appreciate, and maybe I 
shouldn't continue to speak for him.
    I would say as a former FTC Commissioner, I would have 
appreciated having rulemaking authority for the entire bill, 
not for specific sections because there is so much in this bill 
that I think could benefit from some form of rulemaking or 
guidance from the FTC. Just thinking about some of the 
provisions you have included, data brokers as one of many 
examples. It is a great provision.
    I applaud you for including that in your framework. Very 
important to provide visibility of about those entities that 
are operating behind the scenes that have no user interface for 
consumers. So you have done a wonderful job by surfacing that 
issue, but it is going to require some rulemaking in order to 
understand who is a data broker and who isn't a data broker. We 
have seen that in Vermont. We will see that in California, 
which has also adopted this law. So when I think about targeted 
rulemaking, there is a number of different ways to think about 
it.
    There is just general APA rulemaking that the agency would 
have for everything, APA rulemaking authority for a specific 
law, or APA rulemaking authority for specific provisions within 
a law. I like the middle road that I have just described. I 
like--I think for this bill there is so much in it that we 
ought to give the FTC the ability to write rules where it sees 
confusion, or they need greater clarity.
    The Chairman. Ms. Ohlhausen, help us understand the 
distinction.
    Ms. Ohlhausen. Yes, I think the distinction and having 
talked to Chairman Simon about this generally, when you look at 
the way COPPA has worked, where Congress set out some very 
clear guideposts. It set the age, it said parents are going to 
be in control. It made a lot of the hard choices and hard 
definitions and then gave the FTC the job of filling in the 
details and keeping up with technology, such as changing what 
personal identifiable information maybe down the road as new 
technologies come onboard.
    I think that is the idea of targeted rulemaking. So 
Congress has set the provision on data portability. It is not a 
requirement that the FTC just has to come up with, that there 
should be data portability. You are saying Congress has decided 
there should be data portability but then the FTC should give 
some content to where Congress has said these kinds of rights 
should be available.
    The Chairman. Ms. Moy.
    Ms. Moy. Yes. So I agree. I think that would be helpful to 
give the FTC rulemaking authority to flesh out all parts of the 
framework and not just one limited function. And I think, you 
know, if you look at, there is a couple of few things that I 
would give as examples. One is, definitions may need to be 
updated at times to account for changing technology. And so 
Commissioner Ohlhausen just mentioned COPPA a moment ago. For 
example, when the Commission updated the COPPA rule in 2013, it 
recognized that between 1998 and 2013, it had become clear that 
the face of a child could be used to identify them and contact 
them, and so could a voice.
    And those were things that we didn't know or didn't see 
coming quite with clarity in 1998. So it was really important 
to task the agency with updating that in order to future-proof 
the law. And so yes, as Commissioner Brill mentioned a moment 
ago, data brokers as well and just providing data security, of 
course, but providing some functional definitions in the 
statute and then enabling the agency to flush them out and 
update them over time is really important.
    The Chairman. Ms. O'Connor.
    Ms. O'Connor. Mr. Chairman, thank you for that question, 
because it gives me the opportunity to applaud you and your 
staff's work and the provisions in your draft on targeted 
rulemaking and we are comfortable and supportive of those.
    The Chairman. Ms. Richardson.
    Ms. Richardson. Yes, we would prefer that Congress make the 
primary policy decisions here, right. And I think that is going 
to come out with the best solution for users, and where the 
rulemaking is most useful, we think it should be targeted and 
not for the entire bill necessarily. If things were either, 
there is a lack of clarity, right, so something that is 
reasonableness or things are going to scale to different types 
of businesses or where you think technology might change over 
time. And those are two areas that would be most useful.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    Senator Gardner.

                STATEMENT OF HON. CORY GARDNER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO

    Senator Gardner [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank 
you Ranking Member Cantwell as well for this hearing today. It 
is a very important hearing. Thanks to all the witnesses for 
your time and testimony today. In Colorado, obviously, we 
cherish our personal privacy. It is the core of our Rocky 
Mountain values. It is who we are. It is our businesses. It is 
our own businesses unless we say otherwise. That is why I have 
strongly supported efforts to enact a national bipartisan 
privacy policy that respects Colorado's values, respects 
American values, consumer choice and the appropriate 
safeguarding of our private lives.
    Ms. O'Connor, one of the most important principles of 
privacy is adherence to transparency for consumers. That is 
what led me to introduce Protecting Privacy In Our Homes Act, 
which would require the manufacturers of Internet of Things, 
IoT, devices disclose to consumers what that device, when that 
device contains sensitive technologies like a camera or a 
microphone.
    A report surfaced earlier this year that the Google Nest, 
for example, a product that Walmart carries, contained 
microphones not previously disclosed to consumers and I think 
consumers should know what they are buying. They may want one 
with a microphone. They may not.
    Walmart is the world's largest retailer, serves hundreds of 
millions of customers every week around the globe, hundred 
locations in Colorado, sells millions of these kinds of 
products and devices across a wide array of categories. Does 
Walmart believe that consumers should know whether they are 
purchasing items that contain sensitive technologies like a 
microphone or a camera?
    Ms. O'Connor. Senator, thank you so much for that question. 
Absolutely. We agree with the intent and the construct of the 
bill. My only challenge would be we would like it to have a 
more comprehensive omnibus approach to privacy than just a 
product specific one, but we absolutely look forward to working 
with you and your office on the details of that bill and on the 
protections for IoT, which as you point out, we do sell we do 
not manufacture currently, but we very much appreciate the 
intent.
    Senator Gardner. And thank you because I think there was an 
article just last couple of week about Alexa being placed in 
all kinds of different devices. And so this is an important 
conversation that we have with the American consumer and 
manufacturers. Ms. Brill, I just wanted to comment on or ask a 
question based on something you said in your opening statement, 
and perhaps I get a yes or no from everybody on the panel.
    In your statement, you said that ``at Microsoft we believe 
that privacy is a fundamental human right.'' Does anybody on 
the panel disagree? OK, everybody on the panel is in agreement 
with that statement. You also said, I believe you said this in 
your statement, ``consumers have a right to control their own 
data.'' Is that similar to what you said or something you said?
    Ms. Brill. Yes. Yes. I don't remember if it is an exact 
quote, but we absolutely believe consumers do have a right to 
control their data.
    Senator Gardner. And everybody on the panel agrees with 
that? OK. In your statement, you said unlike Europeans or 
Brazilians or Chinese nationals, Americans today do not enjoy 
comprehensive privacy protections that apply across the 
country. What do you mean by Chinese nationals and their 
privacy protections?
    Ms. Brill. Interestingly, in China there is a baseline 
privacy legislation. So leaving aside government surveillance, 
leaving aside some very big issues----
    Senator Gardner. Which seem to go to the core of privacy.
    Ms. Brill. There is no question. But what we are seeing in 
China is that there is a GDPR like law----
    Senator Gardner. But there can be no equivalency to U.S. 
privacy and China?
    Ms. Brill. Absolutely not.
    Senator Gardner. So let me get further into this then 
because I am going to run out of time and you have been here a 
long time, and I apologize for that. This right to control our 
own data, does it include our facial features for facial 
recognition?
    Ms. Brill. From Microsoft's perspective, we have called for 
legislation specifically focused on facial recognition 
technologies, including giving users the ability to consent.
    Senator Gardner. Right. So we would have that consent. So 
that would be handled just like the search on the Internet or 
something like that, that somebody would have under that kind 
of control, or a credit score, those kinds of things. Is that 
correct?
    Ms. Brill. We----
    Senator Gardner. There is a lot of nuances in there. I 
understand.
    Ms. Brill. There is a lot of nuances in what you just said. 
We do believe that users should have transparency around the 
use of facial recognition technology, and they should in 
appropriate circumstances, be able to consent to the use of 
that technology.
    Senator Gardner. But that consent is obviously not given in 
China.
    Ms. Brill. There are many issues with respect to what China 
is doing with a number of technologies.
    Senator Gardner. And facial recognition technology is 
obviously going to be used for very bad and nefarious purposes 
in China as they single out Uyghurs ethnic minorities, as they 
scan Hong Kong protesters, and decide who has a social credit 
score that is acceptable to travel into China, or who is going 
to be allowed to participate in basic freedoms that we adhere 
to. So I know Microsoft is working in China and has some 
announcements on this.
    So, how do you weigh the belief that privacy is a 
fundamental human right, that consumers have a right to control 
their own data with what China is doing with facial 
recognition?
    Ms. Brill. So, thank you for the question. It is a very 
important question. Doing business in China has always been 
challenging, not just in the current state, but has been for a 
long time. We are guided by our commitment to human rights and 
our commitment to democratic values. When we engage with anyone 
in China with respect to any of our products and services, we 
take a very close look at not only the actual product and 
services involved but what are the use cases that are likely to 
arise, and we will refuse to provide technology not just in 
China, but in other circumstances around the world where there 
are human rights concerns.
    We take that our responsibility and our obligation to 
ensure that human rights are protected, including in a facial 
recognition circumstance. We take that obligation and 
responsibility very seriously.
    Senator Gardner. But is Microsoft continuing its work with 
China on facial recognition technologies?
    Ms. Brill. I would be very happy to get back to you with 
regard to specifically what, if anything, we are doing with 
respect to facial recognition in China. I am not aware of our 
doing any work on facial recognition in China at the moment, 
but I would like to ensure that the answer I am giving you is 
correct.
    Senator Gardner. And to be clear, this is broader than 
Microsoft. To be clear, this is broader than----
    Ms. Brill. OK, but your question was about Microsoft and--
--
    Senator Gardner. No, but it is also, I just want to make 
sure that I am not just picking and singling out you, that 
there are other concerns and companies doing the same thing, 
and it is broader than just facial recognition software. It is 
other technologies that could be used to breach the privacy. As 
everyone on the panel has said, we believe this is a basic 
human right and we believe that consumers should have control 
of their own data. That we are empowering very evil actions to 
take place with the imprisonment of over one million Uyghurs in 
Xinjiang province in Western China, and we as a country have to 
make sure that our values don't end where our borders end. That 
wherever we are doing business, our values continue.
    Ms. Brill. Absolutely. And Microsoft takes that 
responsibility very seriously. When I talked about our focus on 
ensuring that the use of this very powerful technology will be 
respectful of human rights, that is a Microsoft approach. I 
can't speak for the entire industry, but we take that 
responsibility and obligation very seriously.
    Senator Gardner. Thank you. Thank you for your time and to 
all of your testimony today. And I am going to close out the 
hearing here. So just appreciate--please accept the Committee's 
appreciation for your time and testimony today and for the 
questions that you have answered.
    The hearing record will remain open for two weeks. This is 
your homework assignment. Hope that you will--Senators are 
asked to submit any questions for the record. Upon receipt, 
witnesses are kindly asked to return their answers to the 
Committee as soon as possible by no later than Wednesday, 
December 18, by the close of business. They will be included as 
part of the record.
    So I would just like to thank you again, and this hearing 
is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:31 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

                            A P P E N D I X

Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Shelley Moore Capito to 
                            Hon. Julie Brill
    Question. In your testimony, you mention that Microsoft offers 
privacy controls to its users. West Virginia has an aging population 
that is at risk of falling victim to online scams and may also have 
trouble understanding the fine print associated with privacy controls 
or privacy policies. How do your users learn about those controls and 
how to use them effectively?
    Answer. We seek to empower our consumers by providing them with 
transparent and easy-to-use privacy controls. Our products and services 
offer a number of controls and resources to enable our consumers to 
configure the level of privacy appropriate for them. To make exercising 
these controls across Microsoft easier for all of our consumers, 
including our older consumers, we have created a Privacy Dashboard, 
where our consumers can view, download and clear personal data tied to 
their Microsoft account including browse history, search history, 
precise location data, and more. Our consumers can also manage apps and 
services that have permission to access certain data connected to their 
Microsoft account, choose whether to see interest-based advertising, 
and update communications preferences. Detailed guidance on how to 
configure controls in our products and services, as well as how to set 
communications and advertising preferences, is available on 
privacy.microsoft.com.
    We are very proud of our Privacy Dashboard and the privacy controls 
that we offer globally, including to our U.S. consumers. We believe 
that offering such controls is essential for protecting privacy and 
building trust. However, we also recognize that user controls are not 
by themselves sufficient for ensuring privacy protection. While more 
than 28 million consumers have exercised our privacy controls, we 
understand that many more of our consumers live busy, complicated lives 
and do not have the time and/or inclination to navigate such controls. 
This is why we have implemented a robust privacy program to ensure that 
we design our online services responsibly and act as good stewards of 
our consumers' personal information regardless of whether consumers 
exercise our privacy controls.
    Companies, rather than consumers, should bear the primary burden of 
privacy protection. We encourage Congress to pass a privacy law 
mandating that all companies bear this responsibility, including, as 
has been proposed in both Senate Commerce Committee drafts, through 
affirmative obligations for companies to minimize the amount of 
personal information they collect and to conduct and document data 
protection impact assessments that may be subject to regulatory 
scrutiny. Additionally, we think that companies should be required to 
uphold duties to reasonably secure personal information from 
unauthorized access and to guard against unlawful discrimination in 
violation of U.S. laws.
                                 ______
                                 
   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Amy Klobuchar to 
                            Hon. Julie Brill
    According to a recent study, 81 percent of U.S. consumers feel that 
they have little to no control over how their personal data is used. 
Both my bill with Senator Kennedy and the bill that I have put forward 
with Senators Cantwell, Schatz, and Markey include a provision to 
ensure that consumers have the right to access and control how their 
personal data is used.
    Question 1. Do you believe that consumers should have the right to 
access and control how their personal data is used?
    Answer. Yes, we believe that enabling consumers to exercise rights 
to access and control how their personal data is used is essential for 
protecting privacy and building trust. However, we also recognize that 
user controls are not by themselves sufficient for ensuring privacy 
protection. While more than 28 million consumers have exercised our 
privacy controls, we understand that many more of our consumers live 
busy, complicated lives and do not have the time and/or inclination to 
navigate such controls. This is why we have implemented a robust 
privacy program to ensure that we design our online services 
responsibly and act as good stewards of our consumers' personal 
information regardless of whether they exercise our privacy controls.

    Question 2. In your view, what more should companies do to inform 
consumers about how they are using, and often profiting from, their 
data?
    Answer. Consumers should have the right to be informed, in a 
concise and understandable manner, about what personal information 
companies collect about them, and how that information is used and 
shared, particularly with respect to how the data is used to generate 
profit. Companies should be required to provide this information in a 
context-appropriate manner at the most meaningful times during the 
experience with the consumer.
    In addition to promoting transparency and consumer control, privacy 
laws should mandate corporate responsibility. Companies, rather than 
consumers, should bear the primary burden of privacy protection. We 
encourage Congress to pass a privacy law mandating that all companies 
bear this responsibility, including, as has been proposed in both 
Senate Commerce Committee drafts, through affirmative obligations for 
companies to minimize the amount of personal information they collect 
and to conduct and document data protection impact assessments that may 
be subject to regulatory scrutiny. Additionally, we think that 
companies should be required to uphold duties to reasonably secure 
personal information from unauthorized access and to guard against 
discrimination in violation of U.S. laws.

     Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tom Udall to 
                            Hon. Julie Brill
    Enforcement is a critical component of any data privacy law, and 
State Attorneys General must play an important role ensuring that these 
laws are followed and consumers' privacy is protected.
    Question 1. Should State Attorneys General have the ability to 
fully enforce a hypothetical Federal privacy law? And should State 
Attorneys General have the ability to enforce state privacy laws--as 
long as they are not in direct conflict with the Federal law?
    Answer. Yes, we believe that a strong Federal privacy law should 
empower the State Attorneys General to enforce the provisions of the 
law. First and foremost, Congress should empower a strong central 
Federal regulator, such as the FTC, to serve as the primary enforcer of 
the Federal privacy law, and should provide that regulator with 
sufficient authority, technical capability, and funding to issue rules 
and appropriately enforce the law. However, understanding the breadth 
of privacy issues needing to be addressed and Federal resourcing 
constraints, we believe that the State Attorneys General must also be 
empowered to enforce the law. State Attorneys General should also 
continue to have the ability to enforce state privacy laws that are not 
preempted by the Federal law, should the Federal law be preemptive.

    Ms. Brill, you know the importance of a Federal Trade Commission 
that is adequately staffed and supported. I worked with my friend 
Senator Moran in the appropriations process to request an assessment 
and a report on the agency's efforts on data privacy and security as 
well as a needs assessment for the agency.
    Question 2. Do you think the FTC is currently staffed with a 
sufficient number of technologists and lawyers to provide adequate 
oversight of companies and their privacy practices?
    Answer. No, the current staffing of 40 employees focused on privacy 
at the FTC is not sufficient to provide adequate oversight of companies 
and their privacy practices. As I stated that the hearing, I think that 
the FTC needs about 500 additional people to accomplish the tremendous 
task at hand of regulating privacy in the digital age. We are dealing 
with an unprecedented amount of data, and we need investments in the 
area of data protection and privacy to not only match today's activity, 
but to be best prepared for this ongoing digital transformation. The 
FTC needs both people, including technologists and lawyers, and 
resources.
    The disparity between the resources of the EU data protection 
authorities and the FTC is tremendous. Italy is a country that is one-
fifth the population size of the U.S., yet Italy has three times more 
employees dedicated to regulating privacy than the U.S. France, the 
United Kingdom, and Spain all also have more regulators dedicated to 
the issue. The most well-staffed European privacy regulator, the Irish 
Data Protection Commission, has one employee working in data privacy 
for every 28,000 persons in that country. By comparison, using the U.S. 
Census population figure of 330 million people, having 40 FTC employees 
working on privacy means that there is just one relevant FTC employee 
for every 8.25 million Americans.
    To further illustrate the disparity in regulatory resources, this 
chart lists the ratios between the number of privacy regulator 
employees and the number of citizens in several prominent countries:

Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Shelley Moore Capito to 
                         Hon. Maureen Ohlhausen
    Question. California recently released a study that indicated CCPA 
compliance could cost companies a total of $55 billion. In the report, 
California acknowledges that, ``small businesses are likely to face a 
disproportionately higher share of compliance costs relative to larger 
enterprise businesses.'' How can we maintain a healthy environment for 
startups and new business development with these barriers to entry? Can 
you speak to how a patchwork of state laws will impact small businesses 
and startups?
    Answer. As you reference in your question, the State of California 
has recognized that startups and small businesses that fall under the 
CCPA are likely to face a disproportionately higher share of compliance 
costs relative to larger enterprises.\1\ Similarly, the European 
Union's General Data Protection Regime has harmed small businesses, 
which lack the resources of large corporations to develop compliance 
regimes for highly complicated laws. In addition, a patchwork of 
different, and potentially conflicting, state privacy laws exacerbates 
the challenges of complying with one complicated regime by requiring 
small entities with limited resources to examine and adapt to 
requirements on a state-by-state basis.

    Spending money and time complying with complicated legal 
requirements deprives small entities of resources they could otherwise 
devote to developing new products and services and entering new 
markets. This dynamic creates barriers to entry for start-ups. Congress 
can avoid creating such barriers to entry by enacting Federal privacy 
legislation that includes strong, but clear, consumer protections that 
are not over complicated and that alleviates the challenge of differing 
state privacy laws by replacing them with a single, national framework. 
With a national and uniform set of protections and consumer rights, 
startups and small businesses would no longer be at a competitive 
disadvantage relative to larger enterprises, who can spend more to 
maneuver through complex regulatory regimes and adapt more readily to 
each new state law or amendment that emerges.
    The proliferation of state privacy laws creates significant 
compliance and operational challenges for startups and small 
businesses. State privacy laws are constantly being enacted and 
existing laws are rapidly evolving. Each law requires qualifying 
businesses to take compliance actions that go beyond standard business 
practices, implement new systems to respond data related requests, and 
be subject to unique fines and penalties. And, unlike larger 
enterprises, startups and small businesses are less likely to have 
significant in-house regulatory resources that would allow them to 
quickly adjust to this evolving patchwork of state laws.
    Most startups and small business are generally ill equipped to 
absorb the large up-front costs to comply with each state law or 
maintain compliance in the face of uncertainty in the future that 
emanates from over complex or ambiguous laws. Initially, startups and 
small businesses incur large legal fees while preparing for and 
interpreting each new law. Legal counsel is necessary for businesses to 
have compliant privacy policies, and so that internal operational and 
technical plans can be made. Next, startups and small businesses may 
have substantial operational and technological costs as they may need 
multiple departments to coordinate on the compliance strategy and 
workflow. Startups and small businesses will likely have to redesign 
their websites, edit forms, and establish technologies to respond to 
consumer requests and other aspects of state laws. Lastly, business 
decisions may change as state laws are adopted and amended, including 
renegotiating contracts with service providers and amending business 
plans to change the way personal information is handled or sold. But 
startups and small businesses may not have the negotiating power to 
push back on service provider contracts or the capacity to change 
business models to accommodate the multitude of differing state 
requirements.

question and testify at the hearing. The Coalition looks forward to

     Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tom Udall to 
                         Hon. Maureen Ohlhausen
    Enforcement is a critical component of any data privacy law, and 
State Attorneys General must play an important role ensuring that these 
laws are followed and consumers' privacy is protected.
    Question 1. Should State Attorneys General have the ability to 
fully enforce a hypothetical Federal privacy law? And should State 
Attorneys General have the ability to enforce state privacy laws--as 
long as they are not in direct conflict with the Federal law?
    Answer. Allowing State Attorneys General (AGs) to enforce a Federal 
privacy law would give consumers greater protection while still 
maintaining a uniform set of protections and consumer rights throughout 
our digital economy. The FTC has limited resources and allowing State 
AGs to enforce a Federal privacy law would supplement the FTC's 
enforcement power. It would also permit State AGs to focus on 
violations affecting the citizens of their state. A Federal privacy law 
that permits AG enforcement would remedy the problems created by a 
patchwork of data privacy laws while leveraging the existing State AG 
enforcement infrastructure to provide greater protections for 
consumers. This model has worked well for the Children's Online Privacy 
Protection Act, for example.
    A Federal privacy law should provide a national and uniform set of 
protections that State Attorneys General could enforce. The goal of a 
uniform system--clarity and certainty for consumers and business--would 
be lost if State AGs were simultaneously enforcing differing State 
laws. A proliferation of different State privacy requirements creates 
inconsistent protections for consumers, as well as significant 
compliance and operational challenges for businesses of all sizes. I am 
concerned that having a provision in Federal legislation that states 
can continue to enforce state laws that do not directly conflict with a 
new Federal law would result in uncertainty and litigation regarding 
whether a state law directly conflicts with the new Federal law. 
Instead, the FTC and State Attorneys General should unite to enforce a 
uniform Federal law.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to respond to your post-hearing 
question and testify at the hearing. The Coalition looks forward to 
working with the committee and all stakeholders to craft strong, 
national privacy legislation.

    Question 2. Ms. Ohlhausen, you know the importance of a Federal 
Trade Commission that is adequately staffed and supported. I worked 
with my friend Senator Moran in the appropriations process to request 
an assessment and a report on the agency's efforts on data privacy and 
security as well as a needs assessment for the agency.
    Do you think the FTC is currently staffed with a sufficient number 
of technologists and lawyers to provide adequate oversight of companies 
and their privacy practices?
    Answer. As our economy and the collection, use, and sharing of 
personal data has continued to grow, the FTC is reaching the limit of 
its current tools and resources, including personnel such as lawyers 
and technologists. As it stands, the FTC has an annual budget of 
approximately $300 million and employs approximately 1,100 staffers to 
carry out its consumer protection and competition missions.\1\ Despite 
the growing need for privacy enforcement, the FTC's budget has been 
flat since 2013 and the number of full-time employees lags behind where 
it was in the early 1980s. The annual budget and number of staffers is 
already lean, and the agency will need additional resources to handle 
the work of enforcing of a Federal privacy law, as well as several 
related rulemakings required by the proposed legislation. Allowing the 
State Attorneys General to enforce a new Federal law will help, but 
expanded resources for the FTC is also essential to enforce a new 
comprehensive Federal privacy law.

    Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Amy Klobuchar to 
                               Laura Moy
    In October, the Washington Post reported that at least 44 
universities in the U.S. are tracking prospective students on their 
websites and collecting information--which can include data on their 
web-browsing habits, ethnicities, household incomes, and test scores--
to help them determine which students to admit. Many of these 
universities do not allow students to opt out of data collection or 
even tell students they are collecting this information. My bill with 
Senators Cantwell, Schatz, and Markey includes a provision to allow 
consumers to opt out of the collection and sharing of certain data.
    Question. Should consumers be able to opt out of having certain 
data collected and shared, and can you speak to the implications of 
this type of data being made available to companies without consumers' 
knowledge?
    Answer. Yes, consumers should have a choice about whether their 
information is collected and shared. Information about students' 
browsing habits, ethnicities, household incomes, and test scores likely 
will reveal highly private details about their lives. For example, 
browsing history can be used to infer a person's political, romantic, 
and sexual preferences--details that many individuals would choose not 
to share if they were given the choice.

                               Laura Moy
    Enforcement is a critical component of any data privacy law, and 
State Attorneys General must play an important role ensuring that these 
laws are followed and consumers' privacy is protected.
    Question 1. Should State Attorneys General have the ability to 
fully enforce a hypothetical Federal privacy law? And should State 
Attorneys General have the ability to enforce state privacy laws--as 
long as they are not in direct conflict with the Federal law?
    Answer. Yes, State Attorneys General should have the ability to 
fully enforce any new Federal privacy law as well as state privacy 
laws. The fact that a majority of Americans describe the current lack 
of privacy protections as a ``crisis'' indicates that we don't just 
need additional legal protections; we also need far more cops on the 
beat.

    It is clear that some data can be very harmful to consumers if it 
is not handled safely and securely, if it has to be collected at all. 
Biometric data systems such as facial recognition can be overly 
invasive and, if misused, can cause housing or job discrimination. 
Children are too often preyed upon online. Data compiled from different 
sources can be used to build profiles of individuals and skirt privacy 
laws. And the capabilities to collect and manipulate data with 
artificial intelligence will only advance as time goes on.
    Question 2. Ms. Moy, when looking at the several data privacy bills 
put before our committee, do you believe current definitions of 
``sensitive data'' are sufficient to cover our most private 
information? Are the proposals being discussed here today enough to 
protect highly sensitive personal data now, and also in the future?
    Answer. I am pleased to see that there are multiple bills before 
the committee that define sensitive data in a way that encompasses 
important categories of information such as biometric data and health 
information. There are, however, important differences among the bills, 
and I highlight a few in particular. First, communications metadata 
should be considered sensitive. Without even looking at the contents of 
a person's communications, one can learn many details about a person's 
private life just from metadata disclosing the parties with whom the 
person communicates, the amount, the times, and the frequency. Metadata 
alone can reveal information about a person's closest relationships, 
financial and health providers and activities, political activities, 
and more.
    Second, information that reveals online activities over time and 
across sites or services should be considered sensitive. This 
information may also be considered metadata regarding online 
communications. Regardless of what category they fall into, web 
browsing and app usage histories should be protected as sensitive 
information. The apps and websites a person uses and visits frequently 
reveal details about romantic interests, sexual activities, health 
activities, and the operation of devices and services--such as baby 
monitors and connected appliances--within the home.
    Third, medical data should be considered sensitive. This should 
extend not only to information about a person's diagnosis and treatment 
collected and maintained by healthcare providers, but also to 
information about health that is collected and maintained by third 
parties, as well as to non-health-related information that is used to 
draw inferences about a person's health. For example, consider the fact 
that a savvy party with access to data generated by motion sensors on a 
mobile phone can draw inferences about whether or not the phone's owner 
has Parkinson's disease from that data. Protections for sensitive 
information should extend to the underlying data at the time that it is 
collected or processed for the purpose of determining whether or not 
the data subject has Parkinson's or any other health condition.
    Fourth, nude or intimate photos and videos of people should be 
considered sensitive. These types of information should not be 
collected, processed, or shared without the explicit opt-in consent of 
the data subject.

    Question 3. Your testimony highlighted the efforts by state 
legislatures to step into the void caused by the lack of a Federal law. 
There is a criticism that it is too unmanageable for corporations to 
comply with different state laws as well as international laws 
governing data privacy and usage. But the point of a privacy bill 
should be to protect consumers--not protect companies from state laws. 
Is it possible to find a balance that preserves a strong role for 
states in a Federal privacy law that also provides more certainty for 
business than they have today?
    Answer. I do believe it is possible for a Federal privacy law to 
provide more certainty for businesses, while also preserving a strong 
role for states. As this question notes, states are currently very 
active on privacy in large part because there is a ``void caused by the 
lack of a Federal law.'' If a strong Federal law were to pass, even if 
it did not prevent states from passing their own, stronger laws, it 
would slow or even stop the current trend at the state level, because 
many state consumers and legislatures would be satisfied that privacy 
needs had been met by passage of the strong Federal law. A strong 
Federal law should set a floor, not a ceiling, for states.

    Question 1. California recently released a study that indicated 
CCPA compliance could cost companies a total of $55 billion. In the 
report, California acknowledges that, ``small businesses are likely to 
face a disproportionately higher share of compliance costs relative to 
larger enterprise businesses.'' How can we maintain a healthy 
environment for startups and new business development with these 
barriers to entry? Can you speak to how a patchwork of state laws will 
impact small businesses and startups?
    Answer. Even though we are one of the biggest companies in almost 
every state, many of our partners, vendors, and suppliers are small 
businesses and/or startups. A patchwork of state laws will not help 
these companies thrive and it will not help their customers either. The 
solution is a simple, clear Federal standard that is applicable to all.

    Question 2. In your testimony, you note that Walmart uses data to 
manage their supply chain and efficiently fill and ship orders. West 
Virginia is home to a brand new Proctor and Gamble facility that I 
imagine is one of those suppliers, but I am sure many of your suppliers 
are also small businesses. How would CCPA and the other various 
legislative proposals impact your ability to share data among large and 
small suppliers alike? What clarifications are needed to ensure those 
supply chains aren't disrupted?
    Answer. The CCPA allows a business to share personal information 
with its contracted service providers so the service provider can 
perform activities required under its contract. The CCPA also requires 
businesses to disclose the categories of third parties that receive 
personal information for a business purpose, such as with service 
providers. Some proposed legislation would modify these requirements to 
disclose the names of the service providers with which data is shared. 
If that service provider is an individual, such as a delivery driver, 
disclosing the names of specific service providers creates a risk to 
the privacy of another person's information.
    Some proposed legislation includes language requiring a business to 
disclose the names of the service providers with which data is shared. 
If that service provider is an individual, such as a delivery driver, 
disclosing the names of specific service providers creates a risk to 
the privacy of another person's information. Additionally, legislative 
proposals should have strong language protecting the sharing of 
information with contracted service providers that also obligates 
service providers to protect personal information they receive.

    Answer. Yes, Walmart supports both the Federal Trade Commission and 
State Attorneys General enforcing a Federal privacy law that preempts a 
patchwork of inconsistent state laws, which are insufficient to protect 
individual privacy and are inefficient for interstate commerce.

                          Michelle Richardson
    New technologies have made it easier for people to monitor their 
health, but health tracking apps, wearable devices, and home DNA 
testing kits have given companies access to consumers' private health 
data, which is not protected under existing privacy law. I introduced a 
bill with Senator Murkowski to require the Department of Health and 
Human Services to address this issue.
    Question. Do you believe that any new privacy regulations should 
cover sensitive health data that is not covered under existing Federal 
health privacy laws?
    Answer. Yes, providing heightened protections for unregulated 
health information is one of the most important goals of a 
comprehensive privacy bill. Congress should broadly define this 
category of data to include information that reflects mental or 
physical health, wellbeing, or status on its face. It should also 
include any information that is collected, processed or shared for this 
purpose, regardless of the nature of the information or how it was 
created and collected.
    We also recommend that Congress directly legislate in this space 
with substantive standards--such as a prohibition on the collection, 
use, and sharing of this data if it is not necessary to provide the 
service a consumer signs up for. Because this data is on the consumer 
market and the companies that collect the information are closer to 
traditional tech companies than health care providers, enforcement 
authority should reside with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

    Answer. Yes, State Attorneys General should have enforcement 
authority in addition to any enforcement conducted by the FTC. 
According to a 2019 Government Accountability Office report, the FTC 
brought 23 enforcement cases against ``unfair'' data practices over the 
last decade.\1\ With new privacy rules to more explicitly regulate 
corporate behavior, it is likely that a meaningful will be beyond the 
capacity of the FTC, even if it receives more resources. Additionally, 
state level enforcement will ensure that localized privacy violations 
will be redressed even if they do not rise to a Federal enforcement 
priority.

    CDT prefers a single Federal privacy and security standard if it is 
sufficiently protective. We believe this can benefit both consumers and 
companies alike. However, preempting states from passing additional 
laws can only be justified by a Federal law that clearly prohibits the 
most egregious data practices. Because the breadth and depth of a 
preemption provision will likely be proportional to the substance of a 
Federal law, we look forward to working with your office to make sure 
that any preemption provision is properly calibrated.
