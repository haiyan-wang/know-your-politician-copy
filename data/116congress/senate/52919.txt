             OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA

    Senator Thune. Good morning, and welcome to today's 
subcommittee hearing, Reviewing the Progress of First Responder 
Network Authority, also known as FirstNet, has made in 
deploying a nationwide public safety broadband network.
    Following several communications failures during national 
emergencies, Congress recognized the need for a reliable 
communications network for public safety officials which led to 
the creation of FirstNet under the Middle Class Tax Relief and 
Job Creation Act of 2012.
    In 2017, FirstNet, which acts as an independent authority 
under the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration, awarded AT&T a contract to build 
out, operate, and maintain the network.
    Since that time, the Committee has held several oversight 
hearings to ensure that FirstNet in partnership with AT&T is 
meeting its statutory requirements to deploy the network, and I 
look forward to continuing those efforts today.
    Having reliable communications services for our country's 
emergency personnel is critical, something the COVID-19 
pandemic has highlighted.
    I know we have folks on the panel today who, along with 
many medical professionals and first responders, have played a 
part in the Nation's coronavirus response.
    FirstNet, along with other carriers that support our 
medical professionals and first responders, enables those 
individuals to connect with Americans in need. Public safety 
officials face numerous challenges accessing reliable services 
and those challenges are even greater for the more rural areas 
throughout the country.
    In my home state of South Dakota, the diverse terrain of 
the Black Hills Region, an area that attracts millions of 
visitors every year, makes communication even more difficult. 
Many Americans and international visitors alike escape to the 
Black Hills to unplug or to disconnect from technology.
    However, when an emergency occurs, reliable communications 
and access to public safety personnel, even in these beautiful 
remote places, is a top priority.
    Expanding geographical coverage is critical to addressing 
the region's unique challenges and making it a safer place for 
everyone to enjoy.
    We must ensure that our public safety officials have the 
tools that they need to best serve our communities and to that 
end, I do appreciate FirstNet and AT&T's commitment to 
enhancing coverage in rural areas.
    Building an interoperable nationwide public safety network 
is not without its challenges and FirstNet, with AT&T, is only 
in its third year of a 25-year contract.
    Earlier this year, the Government Accountability Office 
identified several areas in which FirstNet could strengthen its 
oversight of AT&T. One of the areas mentioned was end user 
engagement. GAO's report found that AT&T does not collect 
enough robust data around the satisfaction of the end user, the 
very groups who will at the end of the day be depending upon 
the FirstNet system to do their jobs.
    I share GAO's view that FirstNet's lack of formal oversight 
into end user satisfaction could ultimately affect the long-
term success of the program.
    Today, I look forward to hearing how FirstNet and AT&T have 
worked to address this and other concerns raised by GAO.
    We have an excellent panel before us today with 
representatives from FirstNet and AT&T as well as individuals 
who utilize the FirstNet network every day.
    Joining us is Mr. Ed Parkinson who serves as the Executive 
Director of FirstNet, Mr. Jason Porter from AT&T, Captain Tony 
Harrison from the Sheriff's Office of Pennington County, South 
Dakota, and Ms. Karima Holmes, Director of the Office of 
Unified Communications for the District of Columbia. Thank you 
all for being here.
    I now want to recognize Ranking Member Schatz for any 
opening remarks that he may have and I believe he is joining us 
virtually.
    Senator Schatz.

                STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN SCHATZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII

    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Chairman Thune, and I want to 
really thank the testifiers.
    It is customary to thank testifiers every time we have a 
hearing, but I want to thank all of you for everything you do 
for public safety and for taking the time out of your 
incredibly busy schedules for this.
    In the face of a global pandemic, FirstNet is more 
important than ever. A decade ago, first responders had no 
dedicated communications network and a patchwork of systems 
left public safety officials exposed and competing with 
commercial users for bandwidth.
    Services and devices for first responders were few and far 
between. Those that existed were expensive and not 
interoperable.
    Today, through FirstNet, public safety now has its own 
communications highway and marketplace catering to its unique 
needs and every state has opted in. FirstNet is the result of 
smart bipartisan legislation, private sector partnership, and 
market-based collaboration.
    FirstNet is also a sobering reminder of the way Congress 
and the Federal Government can and should be playing in 
emergency preparedness.
    In Hawaii, police, EMS, and firefighters use FirstNet on 
several islands and dead zones. They can transform a cell phone 
tower into a radio with a touch of a button and FirstNet's 
assets have brought temporary connectivity to isolated areas in 
the state, even during the recent volcanic eruptions on Hawaii 
Island, to ensure that first responders never miss a beat.
    In recent months, FirstNet had its first true nationwide 
stress test. It's been used nationally in the COVID-19 response 
efforts. FirstNet's capabilities have been used to deliver 
broadband connections to COVID testing centers, emergency 
medical sites, and 9-1-1 dispatchers working from home.
    Its curated app store has even made wellness services 
available to frontline workers. These efforts are encouraging 
but our job is not done until FirstNet serves everyone.
    To reach that goal, ongoing collaboration at the community, 
state, and Federal levels is more essential than ever. It's 
imperative that FirstNet responders continue to openly engage 
with states and local first responders to meet the build-out 
deadlines. This will ensure that we achieve other important 
FirstNet milestones, further migrating first responders on to 
the network and hardening it against security threats.
    As we move forward toward a fully integrated 
infrastructure, FirstNet should be the inspiration for bringing 
other public safety services into the 21st Century, like Next 
Gen 9-1-1.
    Imagine a future where you could text a photo or video of 
an accident or crime directly to 9-1-1 or cars that relay 
timely information to dispatchers about a crash, helping 
responders predict injuries and equipment that might be needed. 
That's the promise of Next Gen 9-1-1, a digital system that can 
share voice and data-rich communications directly with 
emergency dispatchers.
    Next Gen 9-1-1 will improve our public safety 
infrastructure by feeding data into FirstNet. However, like 
FirstNet, it will need Federal support for adoption and 
interoperability.
    In December, my colleagues and I proposed using C band 
auction revenues to modernize this important element of public 
safety and I hope we will act on this proposal soon.
    I also want to note that Senator Klobuchar has been a real 
leader on Next Gen 9-1-1 and want to thank her for her 
leadership and dogged focus on this issue.
    Delivering the FirstNet network is monumental and the 
innovation and persistence of FirstNet gives me hope about the 
next phase of emergency planning, including 9-1-1 services.
    I want to thank the testifiers and look forward to our 
exchanges.
    Thank you.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Schatz.
    We'll move right into our testimony, and as I mentioned, we 
will start with Mr. Ed Parkinson, who is the Executive Director 
of FirstNet, followed by Mr. Jason Porter, who is the Senior 
Vice President of FirstNet Program at AT&T, and then we'll go 
virtually to Captain Tony Harrison of the Sheriff's Office of 
Pennington County, South Dakota, and Ms. Karima Holmes, who is 
the Director of Unified Communications.
    So we will do that, and then we'll get into questions. I 
would ask all of you, if you can, to confine your oral remarks 
to 5 minutes or thereabouts and it will optimize the amount of 
time we have to get into Q&A.
    So thank you again, all, for being here. I'm delighted to 
have you here today, and we look forward to hearing what you 
have to say.
    So we'll proceed first with Mr. Parkinson.

   STATEMENT OF EDWARD PARKINSON, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FIRST 
                  RESPONDER NETWORK AUTHORITY

    Mr. Parkinson. Thank you, Senator.
    Good morning. Good morning to you, Senator Schatz, members 
here in person and joining us virtually.
    I'm here to testify about FirstNet, our Nation's only 
dedicated interoperable broadband network built for and 
dedicated to public safety.
    The genesis of FirstNet goes back to the tragic events of 
9/11 and the ensuing 9/11 Commission report that found that 
first responders could not seamlessly communicate over existing 
networks on that tragic day over 19 years ago.
    Congress heard the call from public safety and established 
the FirstNet Authority back in 2012 with the clear mission to 
ensure the deployment and operation of a nationwide network 
that public safety would use in order to save lives and protect 
our community.
    Our incredible team strives each day to ensure that public 
safety receives state-of-the-art performance from their 
network.
    At the time of passage of our legislation, it was hard to 
imagine the environment in which we find ourselves here today. 
However, I'm pleased to report to the Committee that we have 
come a long way in a relatively short period of time.
    Deployment of the network began in 2018 and in the almost 3 
years since, we now have 1.5 million connections with more than 
13,000 public safety agencies and organizations having signed 
on for service.
    Not only does this reflect the breathtaking speed of 
deployment and adoption but when one compares our spectrum's 
clearance efficiency to other spectrum studied by organizations 
like CTIA, which states in a report that on average it takes 13 
years to reallocate spectrum for wireless use, FirstNet did it 
in just six.
    In my opinion, this progress illustrates two important 
factors. First, public safety needs and is making use of their 
network. For years, first responders were asking carriers to 
access for services, such as priority preemption for 
unthrottled service and for choice.
    Because of the innovative public/private framework that 
Congress outlined for FirstNet and the oversight that my 
organization, FirstNet Authority, brings, responders can now 
trust that these critical communications services are available 
to them and their network will continue to evolve to meet their 
needs.
    Second, FirstNet has done something unique. We've actually 
done what we said we were going to do. We've listened to public 
safety. We've taken their feedback and incorporated it into our 
strategies, acknowledged where we can do better, and doubled 
down on what we've done right.
    We've made incredible progress and our goal is to keep this 
momentum going. We intend to stay at the forefront of 
technology and this is reflected in our first investments 
approved by our board back in June. These investments lay the 
groundwork for 5G and to expand the FirstNet dedicated fleet of 
assets.
    In the past, this committee has asked my team if we were 
running a tight fiscal ship and I'm pleased to report that we 
continue to do just that. Deployment of this network remains 
ahead of schedule and it will be delivered within the resources 
allotted for this project.
    We are self-sustaining and do not take annual 
appropriations from Congress. Our recapitalization model, which 
was established as part of the public/private arrangement that 
we have with our contractor, AT&T, ensures that continued 
operations at the FirstNet Authority will not cost the taxpayer 
one additional dollar and even as we continue to invest in and 
improve the network over the next 23 years.
    I encourage everyone listening here today to visit 
firstnet.gov where we recently launched pages with information 
specific to each state and territory. There, you can find the 
latest on FirstNet build-out in your state and see how public 
safety agencies are leveraging the FirstNet dedicated 
connection.
    Public safety officials can also find their contact 
information for their FirstNet Authority public safety advisor 
and encourage them to reach out.
    Our culture at FirstNet is to listen, learn, and evolve. We 
are constantly striving to improve and to do better. 
Ultimately, public safety lives and their mission of protecting 
our communities depends on it.
    FirstNet is the only public safety broadband network that 
exists because public safety called for it and that is a 
responsibility that I and my team take very seriously.
    For each of us here today, we all know a first responder. 
These are our neighbors, our friends, the lifelines in the 
community when we call for help. We're proud to serve them and 
to connect communities across this country in every state, 
territory, and tribal nation.
    We are just over halfway into this initial FirstNet build-
out and we've had many successes, yet there is much more to do 
as we evolve the network for public safety, and we look forward 
to pushing innovation for the men and women on the front lines.
    If I may be so bold as to ask something from this 
committee, it would be that you continue to remain as engaged 
in this project as you have been over the last few years. 
Continuing to ask what is happening in your respective states 
and identify and observe the progress that we are making. Each 
time and in time, you will hear from public safety on why our 
spectrum lease should be renewed in 2022 and in time why our 
program should be reauthorized.
    I'd like to thank the Subcommittee again for inviting me 
here to testify. I look forward to any questions you may have.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Parkinson follows:]

      Prepared Statement of Edward Parkinson, Executive Director, 
                   First Responder Network Authority
Introduction
    Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Schatz, and all Members of the 
Subcommittee, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to appear 
here today to provide an update on the progress we are making at the 
First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet Authority) on the 
deployment of the nationwide, interoperable public safety broadband 
network (Network or FirstNet). My name is Edward Parkinson, and I am 
the Executive Director of the FirstNet Authority.
    The FirstNet Authority was established by the Middle Class Tax 
Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-96) (2012 Act) based on 
recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Report.\1\ The FirstNet 
Authority's mission is to ensure the building, deployment, maintenance, 
improvement, and ongoing operation of a nationwide, interoperable 
broadband network that helps public safety save lives and protect our 
Nation's communities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Leading up to the passage of the 2012 Act, the public safety 
communications market in the United States was stagnant. There were few 
advancements in technology for our first responders. As a result, 
teenagers with a smartphone had more advanced communications tools than 
our police officers, firefighters, or paramedics. Further, the lack of 
interoperability among vendors and equipment caused voice 
communications to be fractured, expensive, and resulted in a patchwork 
of networks across the country.\2\ For broadband data, first responders 
relied on commercial solutions that were insufficient to meet their 
needs. To resolve these issues, public safety asked for a network 
specifically built for their mission, utilizing dedicated nationwide 
spectrum \3\--a superhighway that would give public safety 
communications ``lights and sirens'' to cut through commercial 
congestion by prioritizing their voice and data traffic during times of 
emergency.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Recognizing the need for a single, nationwide broadband network 
dedicated to America's public safety community, Congress created the 
FirstNet Authority to establish and oversee the FirstNet network. 
FirstNet uses spectrum reserved specifically for public safety to 
provide a wireless communications network that is interoperable across 
jurisdictions and public safety disciplines, with quality of service, 
priority, preemption (QPP),\4\ and market scale. As the FirstNet 
Authority planned for the Network, we consulted public safety in all 50 
States, 5 U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia, and across 
Indian Country. Public safety told us the Network needed to be 
affordable, reliable, interoperable, and custom-built for the customer. 
The network solution needed to be designed to work in the most urban 
areas, where network challenges come in the form of urban canyons, Z-
axis geolocation,\5\ and in-building coverage dead zones; and in the 
most rural parts of our country, where previously, the business case 
did not exist to build networks just for public safety use.

    \4\ QPP refers to a very large set of 3GPP features and 
functionality that the FirstNet Authority and AT&T will utilize to 
ensure that first responders have priority access to Band 14 when they 
need it and, if the situation requires it, prioritization among first 
responders. See FirstNet Authority, Quality of Service, Priority, and 
Preemption, http://www.npstc.org/download.jsp?table

    \5\ Location based technology to solve the Z-axis (vertical) 
challenge would help pinpoint what floor a first responder is on in a 
building. This is a top priority for firefighters.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The 2012 Act directed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or 
the Commission) to allocate 20 MHz of spectrum (plus two 1 MHz guard 
bands)--the D-Block (758-763 MHz/788-793 MHz) along with existing 
public safety broadband spectrum (763-769 MHz/793-799 MHz) 
(collectively referred to as ``Band 14'')--to deploy FirstNet. The ten-
year license to the spectrum shall be up for renewal with the 
Commission in 2022. Additionally, the FCC played a critical role in the 
establishment of the Technical Advisory Board for First Responder 
Interoperability, which delivered its recommendations for the minimum 
technical requirements for the Network.\6\

Technical Requirements to Ensure Nationwide Interoperability for the 
Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network'' (May 2012), https://
docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-12-68A3.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Public safety officials supported the use of Band 14 as the 
nationwide spectrum for the Network.\7\ With a nationwide license to 20 
MHz of spectrum, $7 billion in funding, and after extensive 
consultation with federal, state, local, and tribal public safety 
stakeholders, the FirstNet Authority held an open, transparent, and 
competitive procurement, as directed by Congress, to find a private 
sector partner to deploy the Network. In March 2017, after a 
comprehensive acquisition process, AT&T was selected to build, operate, 
and maintain the Network and signed a 25-year contract with the 
FirstNet Authority.

A Truly Nationwide Network
    When the FirstNet Authority last testified before this 
Subcommittee,\8\ we were focused on working with AT&T, and our Nation's 
Governors, the State Points of Contact (SPOCs), and public safety 
leadership in the states to design individualized FirstNet state plans 
to build out the Network and meet public safety's needs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ See Testimony of Michael Poth, Chief Executive Officer, 
FirstNet Authority, before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation, Subcommittee on Communications, 
Technology, Innovation, and the Internet (July 20, 2017), available at 
https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/E9B67AE8-D32F-42A2-AF42-
6A5B9AFC8A13.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    These state plans detailed the initial five-year deployment of the 
Network for each state, with expanded coverage and capacity in rural, 
suburban, and urban areas. While Governors had a choice to ``opt-out'' 
and build their own state networks, all Governors ultimately decided to 
``opt-in'' and have the FirstNet Authority oversee and AT&T build the 
Network in their states.
    By March 2018, with all states and territories having ``opted-in'' 
to the Network, the FirstNet Authority and AT&T officially began the 
nationwide deployment of the Network and offering public safety 
services, such as priority and preemption, through the dedicated 
FirstNet Enhanced Packet Core, to FirstNet subscribers. Today, we are 
just 2 years into the deployment of Band 14 on both new and existing 
towers, and already we have seen the Network make a major difference in 
the lives of first responders and the communities they serve.
    AT&T recently announced there are more than 1.5 million 
connections--with public safety customers from over 13,000 agencies 
using FirstNet's interoperable public safety communications platform 
throughout the Nation.\9\ AT&T remains ahead of schedule on the 
nationwide deployment, recently stating that it reached over 80 percent 
of the contracted Band 14 build.\10\ By the time the FirstNet Authority 
seeks renewal of its FCC license, just two years from now, we 
anticipate that the initially contracted for Network will be complete 
or nearly complete. Moreover, the Network is operational today and 
serving public safety users. Since the FirstNet Authority is satisfying 
its duties and obligations under the 2012 Act, resulting in a Network 
for public safety that is operational and serving users today, there is 
no question that it is in the public interest to renew the FirstNet 
Authority's FCC license so that the FirstNet Authority can fulfill its 
mission throughout the life of the 25-year agreement with AT&T.

Supporting COVID-19 Response, Hurricane Recovery Efforts, and Other 
        Public Safety Operations
    Upon the deployment of FirstNet and the availability of its 
services, public safety has relied on the Network to serve its 
broadband communications needs. Notably, we have seen an increase in 
the use of FirstNet during the pandemic--a sign that the Network is 
helping public safety carry out its mission in the face of COVID-19. 
Health-care workers and responders are using FirstNet services at 
COVID-19 testing centers, field hospitals, and incident command posts 
across the country. We are seeing an increase in the use of data to 
confront the pandemic at nearly two times the rate of consumer data 
traffic. First responders are taking advantage of FirstNet for 
telehealth as well as adapting the use of the Network in creative ways 
to fit the needs of their specific operations.
    For example, hotspots and smartphones powered by FirstNet are 
enabling 9-1-1 dispatchers to take calls and dispatch operations from 
their homes and remote locations. This enables agencies to allow for 
social distancing among their staff, keeping these frontline essential 
workers safe so they can continue to serve the community. Throughout 
the pandemic, the City of Alexandria, Virginia's emergency 
communications center has relied on FirstNet to support remote 
operations. Using hotspots and smartphones powered by FirstNet, 
Alexandria dispatchers are able to take calls from their homes and 
remain in contact with staff on-site. The FirstNet Push-to-Talk (PTT) 
solution, enabling FirstNet phones to act as two-way radios, ensures 
that telecommunicators working from home are as connected and ready to 
respond as if they were still back at the call center.
    FirstNet priority and preemption and access to dedicated Band 14 
spectrum has provided the fast and reliable connectivity first 
responders and medical personnel have needed during the pandemic. 
Additionally, where FirstNet subscriber agencies have needed additional 
connectivity, they have a dedicated fleet of deployable Network assets 
available on request at no cost to the agency. There have been dozens 
of requests for FirstNet portable cell sites during the pandemic. This 
included boosting connectivity to the U.S. Navy hospital ship Mercy 
when it was docked at the Port of Los Angeles; and supporting in-
building coverage for the U.S. Navy hospital ship Comfort docked in New 
York Harbor\11\ as well as at COVID-19 testing sites, quarantine 
facilities, field hospitals, and emergency operation centers. The 
FirstNet Authority was able to work with its government partners to 
identify the right points of contact aboard the U.S. Navy ship Comfort 
so that AT&T FirstNet could install the best solution for the 
operational needs aboard the ship.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ See Hill, Kelly, ``FirstNet-AT&T supporting naval hospital 
ships in New York, Los Angeles,'' RCR Wireless (Apr. 1, 2020), 
available at https://www.rcrwireless.com/20200401/carriers/firstnet-
att-supporting-naval-hospital-ships-in-new-york-los-angeles.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Network has also supported mutual-aid efforts, including 
situations where ambulances are called in to assist from outside a 
hard-hit region. Paramedics using FirstNet devices and enhanced PTT can 
seamlessly communicate and work together with neighboring agencies. As 
we do for all major emergency operations, the FirstNet Authority will 
continue to gather public safety use cases and best practices from the 
response to COVID-19 so that agencies and practitioners can learn from 
each other and further understand how public safety broadband can 
support their communications needs. Even in the midst of a pandemic, 
responders must address and prepare for other emergencies. FirstNet has 
been there to assist with its dedicated fleet of deployable assets to 
augment coverage and capacity, including during the tornadoes in the 
southeastern United States earlier this spring, recent wildfires across 
California, and what has already been an active hurricane season along 
the east coast and in the gulf.
    Most recently, FirstNet was leveraged in the Gulf states in 
response to Hurricane Laura, a category 4 hurricane making landfall in 
Louisiana on August 28, 2020. Prior to the storm, AT&T's FirstNet 
Response Operations Group (ROG), a team of former first responders who 
manage FirstNet's response in these types of disasters, staged 
deployable units and backup generators outside the path of the storm. 
Immediately following the devastating storm system, the ROG team 
coordinated with state emergency operations centers (EOCs), local 
agencies, and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Urban Search 
and Rescue (US&R) teams to deploy Satellite Cell on Light Trucks 
(SatCOLTs), in-building solutions, and generators to impacted areas to 
support public safety communications efforts on the ground. 
Additionally, FirstNet One (a one of its kind in the world, 55-foot 
aerostat/blimp) was launched on September 3rd to deliver sustained 
network coverage in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, over an expansive area, 
in the aftermath of such a large-scale catastrophic event.
    It is clear, Congress' vision for a nationwide interoperable public 
safety broadband network to serve first responders is working and 
evolving to meet public safety's needs during crises. The pandemic has 
underscored how FirstNet supports communities' ability to respond as 
new challenges arise.
    In addition to the use during the pandemic response, public safety 
has relied on FirstNet in a myriad of other ways since the deployment 
of the Network. The following are just a few examples of how FirstNet 
has supported public safety across the country in various situations 
and events:
    Fire: Seattle, Washington: Last summer, more than 350,000 people 
attended Seattle's SeaFair festival, and for the first time the Seattle 
Fire Department covered the event using FirstNet. Seattle Fire 
Department Chief Harold Scoggins said, ``With FirstNet in place, we 
have increased confidence in our communication methods for use during 
highly attended public events. During this year's SeaFair activities, 
we were able to communicate important safety information without worry 
of encountering congestion issues.''
    EMS: Hattiesburg, Mississippi: AAA Ambulance Service subscribed to 
FirstNet to help connect its 24-hour emergency and non-emergency 
medical transport service. FirstNet is helping the ambulance service to 
seamlessly communicate as they serve 1.2 million residents living 
across 16 counties in southern Mississippi. Andy Geske, Chief of 
Information Technology for AAA Ambulance Service, said, ``What's 
important to me and my crew members is the ease of accessing FirstNet. 
[It] can put everybody on the same page where that response is best for 
the patient.'' In facilitating the integration of telemedicine 
capabilities, FirstNet has allowed the AAA Ambulance Service to swiftly 
and efficiently deliver care to its patients in rural Mississippi.
    Integration with Emergency Communications Centers (ECCs)/9-1-1 
Dispatch: Oglala Sioux Tribe: The FirstNet Authority continues to 
deliver quality service to the 9-1-1 community, and recent successes 
have demonstrated how FirstNet can enhance and enable 9-1-1 
communications. For example, the Oglala Sioux Tribe's Department of 
Public Safety relies on FirstNet to keep their police officers 
connected to ECC dispatch when they are responding to an incident. 
FirstNet supports applications that enable dispatchers to transmit 
mission critical information to responders and remain in touch with 
them as they respond to an incident. And in addition to supporting 
remote call-taking and mobile communications, FirstNet can act as a 
secondary network for ECCs in case of a primary network failure. These 
applications will only grow in their importance as ECCs transition to 
Next Generation 9-1-1, in which data needs to be able to travel in and 
out of an ECC in a quick and seamless manner.
    Consultation: Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa (Red Cliff): 
The FirstNet Authority has worked closely with the Red Cliff Band of 
Lake Superior Chippewa in Wisconsin. FirstNet helped to boost access to 
broadband communications with the addition of a new, purpose-built cell 
site located on the Red Cliff Reservation. Public safety stakeholders, 
in consultation with the FirstNet Authority, identified the location as 
a priority area for increased Network coverage and capacity to better 
support emergency communications. ``Breaking ground on this new cell 
site will not only support the public safety mission, but it will also 
pave the way for new technical capabilities and innovations--furthering 
economic opportunity and extending access to telehealth, online 
learning, and overall communications during emergencies,'' said Theron 
Rutyna, Red Cliff IT Director.
    Large Planned Events: Lake Race at the Lake of the Ozarks: In a 
typical summer, over 10,000 racing enthusiasts gather in Missouri as 
boaters test the limits at one of the most popular powerboat racing 
events in the Nation. The two-day event takes months of planning and 
preparation to ensure that competitors and spectators stay safe on and 
around the lake. During the 2019 event, the Lake Ozark Fire Protection, 
Osage Beach Fire Protection, Missouri State Highway Patrol, Rocky 
Mountain Fire District, Camden County Sheriff's Office, Lake Regional 
Hospital, Lake West Ambulance, and Eldon Fire and Rescue Department 
relied on a FirstNet SatCOLT to ensure robust capacity to support 
communication and data needs. The FirstNet Authority facilitated a pre-
planned event planning meeting with the responder agencies. This 
planning meeting provided AT&T FirstNet ROG with additional information 
regarding the locations where public safety needed coverage, and 
allowed them to deploy the right solution. ``The event went very well. 
Communication with the enhanced PTT devices was seamless, and to have 
the [SatCOLT] on site made our communications between command and 
patrol boat work flawlessly,'' said Matthew Birdsley, Assistant Fire 
Chief, Lake Ozark Fire Protection District.
    These use cases are just a sample of public safety agencies across 
the country making use of FirstNet.
Consultation with Public Safety
    The FirstNet Authority would like to thank all public safety 
stakeholders throughout the country who have engaged with us--they have 
had and will continue to make a direct impact on FirstNet. Since the 
FirstNet Authority was established in 2012, we have built our programs 
and activities around direct consultation and engagement with and 
feedback from the public safety community in every state and territory. 
It is the cornerstone of everything we do at the FirstNet Authority. We 
have focused on maintaining a close working relationship with a diverse 
group of public safety stakeholders--states, territories, tribes, local 
governments, Federal agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), 
and the members of the FirstNet Authority's Public Safety Advisory 
Committee (PSAC).\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\ Under the 2012 Act, the FirstNet Authority was required to 
``establish a standing public safety advisory committee.'' 2012 Act 
Sec. 6205(a)(1) (47 U.S.C. Sec. 1425(a)(1)), Pub. L. No. 112-96, 126 
Stat. 156 (2012). The FirstNet Authority established the PSAC in 
February 2013 consisting of member representation across all 
disciplines of public safety as well as state, territorial, tribal, and 
local governments. The PSAC also has at-large members and Federal 
members. The mission of the PSAC is to assist the FirstNet Authority in 
carrying out its statutory duties and responsibilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Just last year, our public safety advocacy team participated in 
more than 1,100 public safety engagements representing all states, 
tribal nations, and across all public safety disciplines. Through these 
engagements, the FirstNet Authority had discussions with more than 
25,000 stakeholders and collected their feedback on: the Network; 
broadband successes, challenges, and needs; and suggestions for product 
development. These interactions with public safety continue to be 
critical as we lay the groundwork for our future strategy and long-term 
planning for the organization, and as we reinvest back into the Network 
and help drive innovation in the public safety marketplace. We have 
continued our engagement with public safety during the pandemic through 
webinars, virtual briefings, and virtual conferences across the 
country.
The FirstNet Roadmap
    In 2019, the FirstNet Authority worked with our public safety, 
industry, and government stakeholders across the country to develop a 
Roadmap \13\ to guide the growth, evolution, and advancement of the 
Network. Released a year ago, the Roadmap provides a view of public 
safety's operational needs and technology trends for mobile broadband 
communications over the next several years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ See FirstNet Authority, First Responder Network Authority 
Roadmap (rel. Aug. 2019), https://firstnet.gov/system/tdf/
FirstNet_Roadmap.pdf?file=1&type=node&id=1055.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Roadmap is organized around six domains representing 
technologies and capabilities that are vital to public safety 
operations now and in the future, including:

  1.  Network Core: provides the essential intelligence for the 
        functioning of the Network and is foundational to the Network

  2.  Coverage and Capacity: enables robust and ubiquitous access to 
        the Network

  3.  Situational Awareness: envisions real-time access, collection, 
        and distribution of critical information

  4.  Voice Communications: envisions high-quality, reliable voice 
        communications nationwide working seamlessly across analog and 
        digital platforms

  5.  Secure Information Exchange: provides the ability to access, 
        exchange, and manage data securely and conveniently within and 
        across public safety agencies and jurisdictions

  6.  User Experience: seeks to ensure interfaces are designed for 
        specific public safety users' operational challenges

    The Roadmap guides the FirstNet Authority's engagement with 
stakeholders across public safety, the industry ecosystem, government, 
and with AT&T. We identify and pursue opportunities that promote 
technology innovation, policies, procedures, and programs that benefit 
public safety users. The FirstNet Authority uses the Roadmap to help 
prioritize our programs, activities, and investments in Network 
improvements to ensure first responders continue to have the 
communications tools they need to help save lives and protect 
communities. As we gather input through continuing stakeholder 
engagements, we will update the Roadmap so that it remains current with 
public safety's needs and technology developments.
The Public Safety Marketplace
    As we implement the FirstNet Roadmap, we continue to strengthen the 
public safety marketplace. We've seen commercial carriers competing 
fiercely to gain public safety's business. And we've seen industry 
rising to the occasion with new devices, apps, and solutions for use on 
FirstNet. FirstNet has worked with the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST) to certify devices that meet appropriate 
protocols and standards for access, use of, and compatibility with the 
Network, and offerings now include more than 100 apps \14\ and over 200 
devices \15\ as part of the FirstNet ecosystem.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \14\ See FirstNet App Catalog, https://apps.firstnet.att.com/
?auth=false.
    \15\ 47 U.S.C. Sec. 1426(c)(6) requires NIST, in consultation with 
the FirstNet Authority, to ensure the development of a list of 
certified devices that meet appropriate protocols and standards for 
access to, use of, or compatibility with the Network. See FirstNet list 
of approved devices, also known as the ``NIST List'' at: https://
www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/process-document-nist-list-certified-devices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    FirstNet has raised the bar and brought real competition to public 
safety. Now the marketplace is delivering for public safety, and we are 
seeing public safety respond to and adopt these services.
    FirstNet also is delivering new solutions that were never 
previously available to public safety. These include our dedicated 
fleet of SatCOLTs and Cell on Wings (COWs). The network-boosting 
devices are available 24/7 on request and at no cost for FirstNet-
subscribed agencies. This is an important aspect of a public safety 
network because emergencies can happen anywhere. AT&T has since begun 
to provide three COWs and, most recently, FirstNet One--deployed in 
Louisiana earlier this month, as previously mentioned--for use by 
FirstNet subscribers in the aftermath of major disasters. FirstNet One 
can fly up to 1,000 feet, potentially providing over double the 
coverage area as compared to other deployable solutions such as 
SatCOLTs.
FirstNet Investment and Innovation
    The FirstNet Authority will continue to deliver for public safety 
and drive innovation. We are only in the third year of a 25-year 
contract with AT&T and have made substantial progress in Network 
buildout and enhancement, such as the successful recent roll-out of 
FirstNet PTT.
    Going forward, we look to reach other important milestones for 
FirstNet and public safety:

   We will continue to engage with global standards bodies to 
        work towards mission-critical video and data standards, as well 
        as location-based services based on the needs of our users.

   The FirstNet Authority recently took the first step to begin 
        evolving the FirstNet core to prepare for 5G--ensuring that 
        FirstNet will be 5G ready.

   Following the recent investment approval, the FirstNet 
        Authority will expand the fleet of FirstNet deployables to 
        enhance network coverage and capacity for public safety during 
        emergencies and events.\16\

    All of this is in concert with our statutory responsibility to 
consider new and evolving technologies--preparing us for a future where 
the Internet of Things and 5G will help improve public safety 
operations.
    The FirstNet Authority Roadmap drives these efforts and sets a path 
forward for advancing FirstNet. The Roadmap incorporates public 
safety's feedback and accounts for technology trends.
Conclusion
    Thank you to the Subcommittee for the opportunity to update you on 
the FirstNet Authority's progress and our plans for the future of the 
Network. First responders are experiencing the benefits of FirstNet in 
their daily operations. Our primary goals at the FirstNet Authority 
this year and beyond are to continue to responsibly oversee the 
Network, ensure it evolves to meet the needs of public safety by 
engaging and gathering their feedback, and promote competition in the 
public safety marketplace.
    The FirstNet Authority will continue to meet our statutory 
obligations, partner with those who will use and benefit from the 
Network, engage with and seek input from our public safety and 
governmental stakeholders, and work to ensure the successful 
deployment, operation, and improvement of FirstNet.
    I ask that this Subcommittee continue to support the FirstNet 
Authority--particularly with our spectrum license renewal approaching--
as we enter the next phase of this program, to innovate and invest in 
public safety's Network. The support of Congress is critical to 
FirstNet's and, in turn, public safety's success. It is always 
important to remember--this is not the FirstNet Authority's network; it 
is public safety's network. The public safety community fought long and 
hard for the creation of the Network, and it is up to us to continue to 
strive to achieve their vision.
    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.

    Senator Thune. Thank you, Mr. Parkinson.
    Mr. Porter.

  STATEMENT OF JASON PORTER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, AT&T INC.

    Mr. Porter. Thank you, Chairman Thune, Ranking Member 
Schatz, and Members of the Committee.
    I'm Jason Porter, Senior Vice President leading the 
FirstNet Program at AT&T.
    I appreciate the opportunity to update the Subcommittee on 
the critical role FirstNet is playing to connect first 
responders during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, the 
recent hurricanes, and the ongoing wildfires on top of the 
daily activities of public safety.
    I'm proud to report that FirstNet is delivering on 
Congress's vision of a single dedicated and nationwide public 
safety network. Providing first responders with the 
capabilities, coverage, and capacity they need to combat one of 
the greatest challenges of our time.
    Last time we met with this committee, we celebrated five 
states opting into FirstNet. FirstNet is now available to first 
responders in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five 
U.S. territories. Usage has grown exponentially with more than 
13,000 organizations having subscribed and over 1.5 million 
connections. With Band 14 deployed in more than 700 markets, we 
have surpassed 80 percent of our Band 14 nationwide coverage 
target approximately a year ahead of schedule.
    In an emergency or high-traffic environment, this band is 
cleared and locked just for FirstNet subscribers, something 
that first responders will not get anywhere else.
    The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for a nationwide 
high-speed and interoperable communications platform dedicated 
to first responders. FirstNet has answered the call.
    FirstNet is meeting the dynamic communications needs of 
first responders, including frontline public health workers 
conducting telehealth and those at quarantine locations, 
testing sites, health care facilities, and field hospitals.
    Responding to the pandemic earlier this year was like 
responding to a fire, flood, and tornado in every city at the 
same time. The FirstNet network is performing as designed, 
providing reliability, connectivity wherever first responders 
need it, even with the significant increase in consumer usage.
    FirstNet's fleet of deployable assets augmented coverage 
for medical staff aboard the U.S. Naval Ships Mercy in Los 
Angeles and Comfort in New York. We also deployed FirstNet 
satellite cell tower on wheels to support the COVID-19 response 
of the Navajo Nation and Confederated Tribes of the Colville 
Reservation in Keller, Washington.
    FirstNet's performance during the pandemic has been 
exceptional, fulfilling Congress's goal to establish a reliable 
nationwide network that first responders can rely on during an 
unprecedented emergency.
    Unfortunately, during the pandemic, we also had to contend 
with powerful storms and catastrophic wildfires. In response, 
FirstNet is demonstrating its ability to handle multiple 
emergencies at once.
    I was on the ground in Louisiana helping public safety 
respond to Hurricane Laura. AT&T pre-staged assets and deployed 
FirstNet One, an approximately 55-foot blimp which you see 
behind me, which flew above Cameron Parish, Louisiana, to boost 
connectivity for first responders. Public safety thanked 
FirstNet, saying that we were the only ones there and the only 
network working.
    In California and Oregon, we were providing 24/7 support 
for FirstNet-subscriber agencies, and we were proactively 
deploying generators and other assets where there is a power 
outage or a cell tower is down due to fire damage.
    Finally, I want to emphasize that reaching rural parts of 
America is one of our top priorities. Over 1,000 new purpose-
built FirstNet sites are currently planned as part of the 
initial nationwide FirstNet network expansion, most of those in 
rural areas.
    We've launched over 250 of these sites across the country 
already, including areas, such as Preston County, West 
Virginia, Zerkel, Minnesota, the Chippewa Reservation in 
Wisconsin, Bethel, Alaska, Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Roswell, 
New Mexico, Pennington County, South Dakota, Ashland, Montana, 
Naselle, Washington, and in Lewisdale, Mississippi.
    Together, the FirstNet Authority and AT&T are delivering a 
public safety network and solutions ecosystem that gives first 
responders what Congress intended.
    As a West Point graduate and former Army officer, I 
personally view FirstNet as a second opportunity to serve my 
country by giving back to the public safety and health care 
workers who are putting their lives on the line for us every 
day.
    I'm extremely proud of our support for public safety and I 
welcome your questions.

    Thank you, Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Schatz, and Members of 
the Committee.
    I am Jason Porter, the Senior Vice President leading the FirstNet 
program at AT&T. I appreciate the opportunity to update the 
Subcommittee on the critical role the nationwide public safety 
broadband network (``FirstNet'') is playing in connecting first 
responders across jurisdictions and disciplines to enable a unified 
emergency response during the unprecedented coronavirus (COVID-19) 
pandemic. Built in partnership by AT&T and the First Responder Network 
Authority (``FirstNet Authority''), FirstNet is delivering on 
Congress's vision of a single, dedicated, nationwide public safety 
network, providing first responders with the modern capabilities, broad 
coverage, and robust capacity they need to combat one of the greatest 
challenges of our time.
FirstNet's COVID-19 Response
    The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for a nationwide, high-
speed communications platform dedicated to first responders--which 
include health care workers battling the pandemic on the front lines. 
FirstNet has answered the call.
    To begin with, FirstNet is providing critical connectivity to 
support telehealth services, including remote patient monitoring for 
at-risk patients in their homes. FirstNet has also met the 
communications needs and supported the operations of first responders, 
doctors, nurses and public health workers at quarantine locations, 
testing sites, health care facilities and field hospitals. In 
coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (``FEMA'') 
and state, local and tribal emergency operations centers, we performed 
nearly 5,000 COVID-19 related operational location assessments, 
including an evaluation of sites being considered for the staging of 
COVID-19 field hospitals. The FirstNet network performed as intended, 
allowing first responders to maintain reliable connectivity even with 
the massive increase in consumer mobility usage during these 
unprecedented times.
    In those rare cases where additional coverage and capacity was 
needed, we promptly responded to COVID-19 first responder requests with 
FirstNet's fleet of dedicated deployable network assets or other 
innovative connectivity solutions to boost connectivity. These efforts 
included augmented coverage for medical staff aboard the U.S. Naval 
Ship Mercy in Los Angeles and the U.S. Naval Ship Comfort in New York. 
We also deployed two FirstNet SatCOLTs (cell towers on wheels) that 
supported the Navajo Nation's COVID-19 response, supplementing 
connectivity for tribal first responders and FEMA, as well as a 
FirstNet SatCOLT that boosted connectivity for the tribal emergency 
operations center on the Confederated Tribes of the Colville 
Reservation in Keller, Washington.
    FirstNet also enabled the City of Alexandria, Virginia, a FirstNet 
subscriber, to use hotspots and smartphones powered by FirstNet to 
enable 9-1-1 dispatchers to take calls and handle dispatch operations 
from their homes and remote locations during the pandemic.
    FirstNet's performance during the pandemic has been exceptional, 
fulfilling Congress' goal to establish a nationwide network that first 
responders can rely on when our Nation is encountering an unprecedented 
emergency. I am pleased to report that first responders, our customers, 
have heralded the network as a ``game changer,'' describing FirstNet's 
``quick action and network performance'' as essential to support 
``hundreds of public safety personnel actively engaged in response 
efforts'' when ``commercial network devices were unable to handle the 
heavy data transmission needed to adequately communicate'' during the 
pandemic.\1\ Recognizing these benefits, first responders are 
subscribing to FirstNet in strong numbers. Since the pandemic began, 
over 450 public safety agencies have joined or expanded their use of 
FirstNet's services to support their COVID-19 response efforts.

FirstNet Band 14 Coverage Is Ahead of Schedule
    While we are proud of how FirstNet is supporting our first 
responders in this time of crisis, we are also proud to report that 
FirstNet's capabilities are rapidly growing and our nationwide Band 14 
coverage is ahead of schedule. When we last briefed the Subcommittee, 
we had just started our Band 14 build. Today, our nationwide Band 14 
coverage build is more than eighty percent (80 percent) complete and 
ahead of schedule, and usage has exponentially grown--with more than 
13,000 first responder and supporting organizations having subscribed 
and over 1.5 million FirstNet connections now in service.
    FirstNet is now available to the complete ecosystem of first 
responders, including physicians and nurses and other frontline 
healthcare workers, in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 
five U.S. territories. Leveraging public safety's Band 14 spectrum and 
all AT&T LTE bands, FirstNet currently covers more than 2.61 million 
square miles. Band 14 is nationwide, high-quality spectrum set aside by 
Congress specifically for FirstNet. With Band 14 deployed in more than 
700 markets, we have surpassed 80 percent of our Band 14 nationwide 
coverage target--well ahead of schedule. Band 14 is providing a VIP 
lane for first responders and is at the heart of our success. In an 
emergency, this band can be cleared and locked just for FirstNet 
subscribers. That means only those on FirstNet can access Band 14 
spectrum, further elevating their connected experience and emergency 
response. This is unique in the industry and something that first 
responders will not get anywhere except on the FirstNet network.
FirstNet's Focus on Rural America
    FirstNet is for all first responders wherever they are located. 
That is why reaching rural and remote parts of America is one of our 
top priorities. Over 1,000 new, purpose-built FirstNet sites are 
currently planned as part of the initial nationwide FirstNet network 
expansion. Most of these sites are in rural areas. Thus far we have 
launched over 250 of these sites across the country--including areas 
such as: Lusk, Wyoming; Tilghman Island, Maryland; Yamhill County, 
Oregon; Preston County, West Virginia; Zerkel, Minnesota; the Red Cliff 
Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Reservation in northern Wisconsin; 
Bethel, Alaska; Michigan's Upper Peninsula; Roswell, New Mexico; 
Pennington County, South Dakota; Ashland, Montana; Naselle Washington 
along the Long Beach Peninsula; Lucedale, Mississippi (near the De Soto 
National Forest); and in northwestern Minnesota, serving the White 
Earth Reservation. These sites were identified by state and public 
safety stakeholders as priority locations. Our ongoing network 
expansion has also enabled communities--like Pennington County, South 
Dakota; Village of Linden, Wisconsin; the Oglala Sioux Tribe; and 
Mammoth Lakes, California--to modernize their communications and 
transform their emergency response capabilities.
    We are also collaborating with rural network providers across the 
country to help build out additional LTE coverage and extend FirstNet's 
reach in rural and tribal communities. For example, one rural provider 
is adding Band 14 spectrum and AT&T commercial LTE spectrum bands to 
hundreds of its cellular sites across rural Colorado and Nebraska, as 
well as select portions of South Dakota and Wyoming. Similar activities 
by other rural providers are also taking place in Alaska, Arizona, New 
Mexico, Wyoming and more to help us extend the reach of the first 
responder network.
FirstNet Background
    As you take stock of FirstNet's success, it is important to 
remember how and why it began. Congress created FirstNet in the wake of 
the tragedy of 9/11 and based upon a recommendation in the 9/11 
Commission Report because first responders frequently lacked the 
ability to communicate with each other during emergencies. Prior to 
FirstNet, first responders relied solely on over 10,000 disparate radio 
networks for push to talk voice communications to do their job and they 
used the same commercial wireless networks that we all do for calls, 
texts, mobile applications and data. Those networks quickly become 
congested during a significant emergency. We have unfortunately 
witnessed how these communication challenges hamper first responders, 
such as in responding to the 9/11 attacks and many other emergencies 
since.
    In response, Congress recognized that we can and should do better 
to support our first responders and their critical mission. In 2012 
Congress established the FirstNet Authority to address the critical 
problem that the tragic events of September 11, 2001 exposed: namely, 
different agencies of first responders being unable to communicate 
effectively because their radios operated on multiple, different 
networks. To solve this problem, Congress authorized the FirstNet 
Authority to build, maintain, and operate a single, nationwide, 
interoperable public safety broadband network dedicated to first 
responders. The resulting FirstNet network, which AT&T has been both 
privileged and proud to partner with the FirstNet Authority to execute, 
is operating precisely as Congress intended. The current pandemic, and 
the cycles of life-and property-threatening hurricanes, storms, 
tornadoes and wildfires that have roiled America since we last appeared 
before the Subcommittee remind us how important communication is during 
such events.
    The FirstNet Authority and AT&T offer the only nationwide, high-
speed broadband communications platform dedicated to and purpose-built 
for America's first responders and the extended public safety 
community. Additionally, FirstNet is unique because the network's 
buildout and performance is subject to strict contract deliverables and 
accountability from the FirstNet Authority. Through FirstNet, our 
Nation's first responders are receiving the unthrottled, connectivity 
and priority communications they need on a highly secure and dedicated 
platform. This unparalleled highly secure and dedicated platform 
distinguishes FirstNet--public safety's network--from commercial 
wireless networks that are not designed to cut through the potential 
clutter of commercial mobile traffic and that are not subject to 
oversight by the FirstNet Authority. And it illustrates precisely why 
public safety fought so hard for the creation of the FirstNet Authority 
and the deployment of the FirstNet network.
FirstNet Overview
    FirstNet is the only dedicated wireless broadband communications 
ecosystem built for America's first responders, meeting the needs of 
firefighters, EMS, law enforcement, 9-1-1 centers, and emergency 
managers, providing:

   Security. FirstNet provides a unique, differentiated, and 
        highly secure network platform, encrypted at its dedicated 
        network core.

   Priority/Preemption. FirstNet provides its eligible users 
        with priority and, for primary users, pre-emption. ``Priority'' 
        means just that--in times of emergencies and network 
        congestion, FirstNet gives first responder communications 
        precedence and, for ``primary users,'' preempts all other 
        communications. And, if an area is hit with an emergency (e.g., 
        hurricane, wildfire), a local commander can provide elevated 
        priority to the FirstNet users supporting the response. For 
        example, in a hurricane, a commander could upgrade the priority 
        level of evacuation vehicle operators prior to the storm, then 
        shift priority to the medical personnel and utility workers 
        after the storm passes through.

   Interoperable. FirstNet delivers interoperability across 
        public safety agencies and jurisdictions, meaning that they can 
        communicate with each other using a common, highly secure 
        network platform that avoids the congestion that impacts 
        commercial networks in times of emergency. In New York City, 
        for example, FirstNet equipped hundreds of ambulances, EMS and 
        other first responders with a common, interoperable 
        communications platform and dedicated connectivity to help them 
        coordinate the transport of patients between hospitals and 
        health systems across the state. Coordinating with New York 
        public safety agencies, government officials, and city 
        hospitals, the FirstNet team at AT&T provided a cross-agency 
        solution to marshal hundreds of ambulances that came from 
        outside the region into the city to perform mutual aid.

   Dedicated Customer Service. Customized customer service with 
        dedicated 24/7/365 security and helpdesk operations support 
        centers just for FirstNet subscribers.

   Network Disaster Recovery resources. AT&T supports FirstNet 
        with its FirstNet Response Operations Group (ROG), which serves 
        as public safety's direct partner to meet their connectivity 
        needs, whenever they need it. This group helps to manage the 
        FirstNet-dedicated portable network assets, such as the mobile 
        cell sites that link to FirstNet via satellite and do not rely 
        on commercial power availability. These assets are available 
        free of charge to FirstNet subscribed agencies and include 72 
        Satellite Cell on Light trucks (SatCOLTS), three Flying Cells 
        on Wings (Flying COWs) and FirstNet One--an approximately 55-
        foot blimp, which most recently flew above Cameron Parish, 
        Louisiana to boost connectivity for first responders following 
        the devastation left by Hurricane Laura. FirstNet users are 
        further supported by the hundreds of AT&T commercial deployable 
        assets that are also available to help meet their connectivity 
        needs--when and where they need it. More than 40 sites 
        nationwide house the 72 SatCOLTs dedicated to FirstNet 
        subscribers, enabling a 14-hour delivery window. The assets can 
        be called upon by FirstNet users after a natural disaster has 
        struck and infrastructure has been damaged or when first 
        responders are responding to an emergency incident in a remote 
        location. The deployable program has been a huge success. So 
        far this year, public safety has turned to FirstNet deployable 
        network assets and requested additional support during more 
        than 450 emergencies and planned events--like sporting events, 
        parades and training activities vital to keeping first 
        responders mission-ready. Of these requests, more than 60 
        requests were related to COVID-19 response operations and more 
        than 50 requests were associated with Hurricane Laura.

   FirstNet App Ecosystem and FirstNet App Developer Program. 
        AT&T is bringing 21st Century innovation to first responders. 
        In 2017 we launched the FirstNet App Catalog and Developer 
        Program dedicated to America's first responders. The catalog 
        now identifies more than 125 highly secure applications tested 
        for public safety that can help cost-effectively enhance their 
        situational awareness and other capabilities. For instance, 
        fire fighters have access to applications that allow them to 
        track the progression of a fire and view a map that shows the 
        location of their team members and other assets. This 
        information can help equip the incident commanders with vital 
        information to help them stage and respond to the fire and help 
        keep their crews and equipment safe. The FirstNet Developer 
        Program encourages developers to design applications with 
        solutions built for the unique needs of first responders and 
        provides Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that in turn 
        can support the sharing of information and integration across 
        different mobile applications. It also provides a platform for 
        the first responder community to educate the developer 
        community about their unique needs and priorities. The program 
        thus provides first responders with a one-stop-shop for 
        reliable, highly secure solutions optimized for the FirstNet 
        network platform. Before any app is made available in the App 
        Catalog, the FirstNet Authority and AT&T jointly review the 
        applications for, at a minimum, security, reliability and 
        privacy, giving first responders added confidence that the 
        mobile application performs in critical situations. By pushing 
        innovation to the application level, we are making these 
        innovations readily available to all public safety users, no 
        matter their location or size.

     One particularly successful solution developed and 
            found within the FirstNet App Catalog is FirstNet Push-to-
            Talk (PTT), the first-ever nationwide mission-critical 
            standards-based push-to-talk solution to launch in the U.S. 
            We tested the FirstNet PTT solution with public safety 
            agencies across the country, including the Cranford Police 
            Department in New Jersey. FirstNet PTT is designed to 
            enable public safety to use their smartphones, feature 
            phones, and specialized ultra-rugged devices like they 
            would use a two-way radio, with highly reliable, high-
            performance calling. FirstNet PTT will also deliver new 
            features that allow first responders to better react to 
            changing events.

   Devices. There are now over 150 FirstNet Ready devices, with 
        Band 14 capability access built in and compatible with the 
        FirstNet SIM card. Devices range from the iOS and Android 
        platforms, ruggedized mobile and in-vehicle devices, and custom 
        designed solutions, such as the built-in ``Push-to-Talk'' 
        capability on some devices. Critically, the ability for health 
        care professionals and first responders to disinfect the 
        ruggedized, public safety devices has been helpful during the 
        COVID-19 pandemic. When managing patients and working to 
        mitigate the spread of COVID-19, ``mobile hygiene'' is top of 
        mind to frontline workers. For instance, the FirstNet Ready 
        Sonim XP8 is ideal for ambulances and those at COVID-19 testing 
        sites due to its resistance to chemicals. The XP8 can be fully 
        submerged and can withstand a variety of different cleaning 
        products from simple soap and water to heavy-duty cleansers and 
        disinfectants, such as bleach and isopropyl alcohol. This is 
        simply another example of the FirstNet ecosystem driving 
        innovation for first responders and delivering solutions that 
        are specifically tailored for their unique needs during 
        difficult circumstances, such as the current pandemic. 
        Together, these capabilities will better connect first 
        responders to the critical information they need both in their 
        routine operations and during an emergency, helping them do 
        their jobs more effectively and efficiently.
FirstNet Is Aiding First Responders in Other Emergency Situations
    We take the greatest pride in reporting on how FirstNet is 
meaningfully serving as a partner to America's public safety and aiding 
first responders during large planned events and in emergency 
situations. In addition to the COVID-19 and other response examples 
above, I would like to highlight the following for the Subcommittee:

   Pacific Northwest Wildfires. The FirstNet ROG and the AT&T 
        network teams are actively supporting FirstNet subscribed 
        agencies responding to the active wildfires in California, 
        Oregon and Washington. We are doing this by: (1) dynamically 
        monitoring the network and carefully tracking where the fires 
        are located, and communicating with the states emergency teams 
        in order to protect critical communications infrastructure; (2) 
        proactively tracking and deploying generators and other assets 
        where there is a brownout, commercial power outage, or 
        disruption due to fire damage; and (3) FirstNet ROG liaisons 
        are providing 24/7 support to FirstNet subscribed agencies in 
        the states. If a FirstNet subscribed agency has connectivity 
        needs, the agency can reach out to its FirstNet Solutions 
        Consultant or the FirstNet Customer CARE (staffed 24x7x365) to 
        submit a FirstNet deployable request. Thus far, since June 
        2020, we have managed more than 50 deployable requests in the 
        western United States to support emergency response to the 
        wildfires, having deployed assets and other connectivity 
        solutions to support FirstNet subscribed agencies responding to 
        numerous fires, including the Red Salmon Fire in Willow Creek, 
        California, the El Dorado Fire in Yucaipa, California, the 
        Holiday Farm Fire in Blue River Oregon, the fires in Gates, 
        Oregon, and the Cold Spring Canyon Fire in Bridgeport, 
        Washington.

   Hurricanes Laura and Sally. In late August 2020, the 
        FirstNet ROG--led by a team of former first responders--guided 
        the deployment of the dedicated FirstNet fleet based on the 
        needs of public safety in anticipation of Hurricane Laura, the 
        strongest Hurricane to come ashore in Louisiana in two 
        centuries. The team activated FirstNet liaisons to support the 
        affected states' Emergency Operations Centers. The FirstNet ROG 
        also deployed alongside FEMA's Urban Search and Rescue 
        management team to provide real-time assessment and triage 
        capabilities in support of the teams on the ground in the 
        hardest hit areas. In addition, AT&T pre-staged assets to 
        support Hurricane Laura response efforts. For Hurricane Sally, 
        the FirstNet ROG staffed Emergency Response Centers and managed 
        deployable requests in Florida, Louisiana and Alabama, 
        including sending assets to Pensacola, Florida, Sulphur, 
        Louisiana, and Robertsdale, Alabama.

   Tennessee Tornados. During the devastating early March 
        tornados in Tennessee, Putnam County's Emergency Operations 
        Center turned to FirstNet to provide critical communications. 
        Within hours, FirstNet deployed dedicated portable network 
        assets, including SatCOLTs to Putnam County, reinforcing 
        communications and allowing first responders to more 
        efficiently and effectively coordinate their efforts. The land 
        mobile radio (LMR) network tower--which is public safety's 
        traditional two-way radio system--serving Cookeville and the 
        surrounding area was damaged by the storm. In the storm's 
        immediate aftermath and the days that followed, FirstNet served 
        as the primary line of communications for first responders 
        supporting search and rescue and recovery efforts

   Hurricane Dorian. Last year, in 2019, when Hurricane Dorian 
        threatened the east coast, the FirstNet Response Operations 
        Group jumped into action, pre-staging deployable assets and 
        coordinating across dozens of public safety agencies and 
        organizations to provide them with the communications needed 
        before, during and after the storm. FirstNet liaisons provided 
        24/7 staffing to support Emergency Operations Centers in the 
        affected states, and we were on-site supporting the FEMA 
        National Response Coordination Center. From planning and pre-
        storm prep to post-storm support, the team was working beside 
        public safety every step of the way.

   2020 Super Bowl. We worked with public safety more than a 
        year ahead of the Super Bowl in 2019 and again in 2020 to make 
        public safety-specific preparations, ensuring the FirstNet 
        communications platform was ready. As fans continue breaking 
        data usage records at these major events, first responders 
        using FirstNet do not have to compete with spectators uploading 
        photos and videos from the game.

   Tribal Search and Rescue. In the fall of 2018, the Yankton 
        Sioux Tribe Police Department conducted a search and rescue 
        mission for a missing person in a remote area in southeastern 
        South Dakota. The department requested a FirstNet deployable 
        network asset to boost connectivity. Within hours of the 
        request, a FirstNet SatCOLT was in place to help the tribal 
        first responders carry out their operation.

   Hurricane Florence. During Hurricane Florence, in 2018, the 
        FirstNet Response Operations Group was ready to support first 
        responders. We deployed a SatCOLT to the staging area in 
        Whiteville, North Carolina to aid emergency response efforts. 
        According to the Director of Emergency Services for Whiteville, 
        they lost their land-based mobile systems in the storm, but 
        when everything was down, FirstNet was working.

   Hurricane Michael. Prior to Hurricane Michael, in 2018, we 
        pre-staged network assets along the Gulf Coast for quick 
        deployment, including 32 Cells on Wheels (COWs) and SatCOLTs; 7 
        Emergency Communications Vehicles and Emergency Communications 
        Portables; and one Hazmat and Mobile Command Center. We 
        received 30 FirstNet deployable requests from FirstNet 
        subscribed public safety agencies. The FirstNet ROG sent assets 
        to the hardest-hit areas to support national guardsmen, airmen, 
        state patrol, trauma care, police, fire and rescue teams from 
        as far away as Oregon. A Flying COW hovered at 200 feet above 
        the ground over Mexico Beach, Florida and provided service to 
        customers and first responders in the surrounding area. Working 
        with then-Florida Governor Rick Scott, we identified public 
        safety agencies that were without commercial service and 
        activated hundreds of FirstNet enabled devices to help these 
        first responders carry out their mission.

   California Camp Wildfire. AT&T worked closely with the 
        California Emergency Operations Center regarding the quick 
        moving fires to address the needs of the state and first 
        responders working to contain the Camp Wildfire, then the most 
        destructive and devastating fire in California history. Between 
        FirstNet-requested assets and assets deployed by the AT&T 
        Network Disaster Recovery team, 11 portable cell sites and 
        additional network recovery equipment were deployed throughout 
        the state to support public safety communications and to bring 
        connectivity to affected communities in Northern and Southern 
        California. This included SatCOLTs deployed at locations in 
        Paradise and Oroville, California.
Conclusion
    While we are proud of what we've accomplished in a short time, I am 
even more excited about what the future will bring, as we continue to 
meet Congress' goal (and our commitment) to give our first responders 
the advanced communications capabilities that they need to stay 
connected and help them operate faster, safer and more effectively when 
lives are on the line. As the leader of the AT&T team supporting 
FirstNet, I can assure you that AT&T views FirstNet as much more than a 
business proposition, it is a core mission. We are honored to be the 
private partner working together with the FirstNet Authority to make 
the vision of Congress and the public safety community a reality. 
Together, the FirstNet Authority and AT&T are delivering a public 
safety network and solutions ecosystem that gives first responders what 
Congress intended: the advanced technology they need to communicate and 
collaborate nationwide across agencies and jurisdictions during routine 
operations and emergencies. Supporting first responders is part of our 
company's DNA. From installing the first telephone at the Chicago 
Police Department in the late 1800s, to delivering on FirstNet today, 
we have been the partner to America's first responders for over 140 
years. As a former Army officer, I personally view FirstNet as a second 
opportunity to serve my nation by giving back to the public safety and 
health care workers who are putting their lives on the line for us 
every day. I look forward to continuing this important dialogue as 
FirstNet moves forward. I welcome your questions.

    Senator Thune. Thank you, Mr. Porter, and thank you for 
your service to our country.
    Mr. Porter. Yes, sir.
    Senator Thune. Next up is Captain Tony Harrison of the 
Sheriff's Office of Pennington County, South Dakota, someone 
I've known and been acquainted with for a long time, and I know 
they are very involved in the work of FirstNet and I'd love to 
hear what Captain Harrison has to say.
    So, Tony, if you're out there virtually, please proceed.

STAEMENT OF CAPTAIN TONY HARRISON, SHERIFF'S OFFICE, PENNINGTON 
                      COUNTY, SOUTH DAKOTA

    Captain Harrison. Yes, sir. Ranking Member Schatz, Members 
of the Senate Subcommittee on Communications, Technology 
Innovation, and the Internet, and to my own Senior Senator from 
the great state of South Dakota, Chairman John Thune, it's an 
honor to be speaking with you this morning.
    I am Captain Tony Harrison of the Pennington County 
Sheriff's Office in the State of South Dakota.
    Pennington County is the home of the beautiful Black Hills 
with many lakes, hiking trails, Badlands National Park, 
Ellsworth Air Force Base, and, of course, Mount Rushmore.
    I have served the great citizens of Rapid City and 
Pennington County for over 24 years while I worked as a patrol 
officer. I spent 8 years in the Narcotics Unit as an 
investigator, undercover operatives, and supervisor. I moved 
through the ranks and I currently hold the position of captain 
in our Criminal Investigation Division where I oversee every 
major crime and death investigation that happens in Pennington 
County.
    I command the largest SWAT team in the state of South 
Dakota, a team that can travel anywhere in the state when 
requested to help other agencies with having to typically deal 
with someone who's in a major state of crisis.
    I tell you all this just to make you comfortable with my 
experience over the years and my aspects of law enforcement 
which is why I'm here today to talk to you about this important 
issue.
    Pennington County is about 130 miles wide and nearly 60 
miles tall, roughly 2,800 square miles, over twice the size of 
the state of Rhode Island. We serve close to 150,000 residents 
every single day and in the summer months, nearly three million 
people come to see the great faces and great places of South 
Dakota.
    Throw in a little motorcycle rally about 20 miles down the 
road in Sturgis and an occasionally blizzard, nothing beats the 
snow, hopefully not at the same time, and you can bet our 
services are tested daily as we keep the citizens of our county 
safe.
    I'm here today on behalf of Sheriff Kevin Thom to talk 
about the FirstNet Program as it relates to providing services 
across the country and for our state's first responders.
    In South Dakota, over 50 percent of the sheriff's offices, 
the state of South Dakota itself, and seven of the top 10 
largest cities as well as half the tribal agencies use FirstNet 
as their service provider in some capacity.
    Our agency decided to switch to FirstNet about 18 months 
ago after the promise of having better coverage. After speaking 
with Lisa Home, Pam Bryan, and Doug Pennington, and other 
representatives, they also committed to a future build plan 
which will provide much more reliable service in the future.
    By the way, Senator Thune, Pam Bryan said she went to 
school with you and wanted to tell you hello.
    Pennington County is very unique. Our east side has the 
rolling plains, the Badlands, farm and ranch land. It's fairly 
flat and sparsely populated and cell signal can quickly be lost 
out there.
    The lowest elevation of Pennington County is about 2,100 
feet above sea level near the Badlands. The highest spot in 
Pennington County is over 7,200 feet near Black Elk Peak. Mount 
Rushmore sits at 5,700 feet.
    You can see the vast difference from one side of our county 
to the other. When you get into the Black Hills, oftentimes 
radio and phone coverage can be very difficult. One of our 
greatest concerns is as we ensure the safety of everyone in 
Pennington County is the ability to communicate. In any 
critical event, the first thing that goes typically is 
communication. Losing the ability to communicate can be 
devastating and lead to failed missions whether the mission is 
something as simple as rescuing someone who's fallen and gotten 
hurt in the Black Hills or an active threat in a school.
    FirstNet has provided the tools we need to get the 
communication and it should only get better.
    We've spend a lot of time looking for lost and missing 
people in Pennington recently, including a young girl named 
Serenity, who we'd been searching for since February 2019. In 
her search, we have logged thousands and thousands of man 
hours, walked over 6,000 miles and had over two dozen different 
search dogs as we have paced back and forth across the most 
rugged terrain of the Black Hills. Many times, those areas have 
been very rugged with no cell reception.
    We called FirstNet and they immediately deployed one of 
their ``cell on wheels,'' a COW, and those were able to help us 
communicate better.
    As recently as July 3 of this year, President Trump came to 
our great state to watch the fireworks at Mount Rushmore. 
Obviously this is a major undertaking, having not just 
fireworks at Mount Rushmore but also a Presidential visit on 
top of it.
    We knew the cellular networks would be stressed. On the day 
prior as I was preparing the mobile command posts, we quickly 
realized our current cell signal was not going to be strong 
enough to pipe all the information through it that we needed.
    I made one call to our FirstNet representative and within 
hours, he had set up a dedicated band for our command posts 
which was able to efficiently manage the entire day's events. 
FirstNet was truly a lifesaver for the agency on that day.
    Is FirstNet the perfect solution? It is not. There's not a 
perfect solution out there and we know that. In the beginning, 
we had billing complications but working with FirstNet and 
especially Pam, we were able to work through those issues in a 
short period of time and I note today our billing staff is much 
happier.
    Thank you. This is a testament to FirstNet's commitment to 
our customers.
    We're holding FirstNet accountable for the expanded tower 
networks in the Black Hills. We got onboard with FirstNet 
because we saw the vision and we trust that they're going to 
fulfill the promises of coverage in Pennington County and South 
Dakota. They have completed two towers that already have 5G 
coverage nearby in Selder and Wall, South Dakota, and two 
towers are currently being worked on right now in the Hill City 
area.
    This has added some logistical work because it's happening 
on Forest Service land. So if I have one ask for this 
committee, it is this. Please help our citizens by helping 
FirstNet get through any of the issues that come with working 
and trying to build on Federal land. It will be greatly 
appreciated from our end.
    I've been told it will be done by the end of 2022 and we're 
anxious to have the builds done as soon so they can, so we have 
better coverage in the Black Hills.
    In closing, I'm happy to report FirstNet has been very good 
for Pennington County Sheriff's Office and the citizens of our 
county. We're excited to see the next step in coverage and 
trust it will be completed in the very near future.
    Thank you for having me today, and I'll stand for any 
questions.

    Prepared Statement of Tony Harrison, Captain, Pennington County 
               Sheriff's Office, Rapid City, South Dakota
    Ranking Member Schatz, Members of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on 
Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet and to my own 
Senior Senator from the Great State of South Dakota, Chairman John 
Thune, it is an honor to be speaking with you this morning. I am 
Captain Tony Harrison, from the Pennington County Sheriff's Office in 
the State of South Dakota. Pennington County is home of the beautiful 
Black Hills. We are the home of many lakes, hiking trails, Badlands

    Pennington County is about 130 miles wide and nearly 60 miles tall, 
roughly 2800 square miles, over twice the size of the state of Rhode 
Island. We serve close to 115,000 residents day in and day out and in 
the summer months, nearly 3 million guests come to see the GREAT FACES 
AND GREAT PLACES of South Dakota. Throw in a little motorcycle rally 
called Sturgis just 20 miles down the road that draws nearly \1/2\ 
million people and an occasional blizzard dumping several feet of snow 
(hopefully not at the same time!) and you can bet, our services are 
tested daily as we work to keep the citizens of our county safe.
    I am here today on behalf of Sheriff Kevin Thom to talk about the 
FirstNet program as it relates to providing service across the country 
and our state for first responders. Over 50 percent of the Sheriff

    Pennington County is very unique. Out east, we have rolling plains,

sparsely populated as the east end of our county is, cell signal can 
quickly get very spotty. The lowest elevation in Pennington County is

lead to failed missions, whether the mission is as simple as rescuing 
someone who has fallen and gotten hurt in the Black Hills or an active 
threat in a school. FirstNet has provided the tools we need to have 
great communication and it should only get better.
    We have spent a lot of time looking for lost and missing people in 
Pennington County recently, including searching for a young girl named 
Serenity who we have been searching for since February 2019. In her 
search, we have logged thousands and thousands of man-hours, over 6000

to those builds. The two towers we are most interested in right now are 
planned to be built on forest service land, both near Hill City, SD. 
That has added some logistical work due to them being on Federal land 
and if I have one ask, it is this: Please help our citizens by helping 
FirstNet get through any of the issues that come with working and 
trying to build on Federal land. I know we would greatly appreciate the 
help from your end. I've been told they will be done by the end of 2022 
but we are anxious to have these built sooner because they will greatly 
improve our coverage in the southern Black Hills.
    In closing, I am happy to report, FirstNet has been good for the 
Pennington County Sheriff's Office and the safety of our citizens. We 
are excited to see the next step in coverage and trust it will be 
completed in the very near future.
    Thank you for having me today and I'll certainly stand for any 
questions.

    Senator Thune. Great. Thank you, Captain Harrison.
    I will now move to Ms. Holmes and also joining us 
virtually. So please proceed.

             STATEMENT OF KARIMA HOLMES, DIRECTOR, 
                     UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS

    Ms. Holmes. Thank you.
    Good morning, Chairman Wicker, Subcommittee Chair Thune, 
Ranking Member Senator Schatz, Senator Cantwell, other 
Distinguished Committee Members, staff, guests, and the viewing 
public.
    My name is Karima Holmes. I serve under the leadership of 
Mayor Muriel Bowser as the Director of Washington, D.C.'s 
Office of Unified Communications, which is the 9-1-1 and 3-1-1 
Emergency Communications Center, ECC.
    I am proud to sit before you today representing over 6,500 
ECCs across this Nation.
    I deeply appreciate this opportunity to highlight the vital 
role the 9-1-1 centers play in creating a comprehensive and 
truly seamless first responder network.
    Before I continue, I would also like to state for the 
record that I was appointed to the FirstNet Authority Board in 
October 2019. However, my testimony today will only reflect my 
perspective as D.C.'s 9-1-1 Director and will be based on the 
expertise I honed during my decades-long career at the helm of 
ECCs in the states of Georgia, Texas, and the Nation's Capital, 
as well as my stints at the industry engagement with 9-1-1 
advocacy groups.
    The OUC operates and maintains 10 radio sites, over 8,000 
radios for public safety and city services, along with the 
regional cache of close to 1,000 radios which are deployed for 
events, like inaugurations, protests, and major weather 
systems.
    We're also responsible for the District's Respondent Mobile 
Data Computing Units and other handheld devices.
    All told, my agency processes over three million 9-1-1 and 
3-1-1 calls for service and 12 million push-to-talk radio 
transmissions annually.
    More recently, we completely overhauled our technical 
infrastructure, software platforms, and critical programs. 
These enhancements are coupled with the FirstNet platform and 
FirstNet power devices.
    In fact, as the Nation grappled with the far-reaching 
demands brought on by COVID-19 pandemic, my resolute and sharp 
mayor, Mayor Bowser, commissioned me to leverage the full 
extent of our capabilities to enact methods that would 
safeguard my staff while maintaining the District's public 
safety lifeline without interruption.
    Immediately, I spread my staff out between our three 
worksites and transitioned some of my teams to operate 
remotely. My five devices powered by FirstNet have enabled my 
entire administrative staff. The majority of my 3-1-1 agents 
and my nine emergency 9-1-1 call-taking operations to telework 
using a secure, reliable connection from their homes.
    Having a dedicated network, knowing that the critical 
information that we are processing related to literally 
hundreds of incidents per hour from the caller to the call-
taker to responding units in the most secure manner possible is 
not negotiable.
    Due primarily to its proximity and responsibility for 
providing public safety communications services for the seat of 
our government, the OUC operates with a unique advantage over 
most ECCs in terms of resources and support.
    I will be remiss not to recognize this privilege and use 
this opportunity to advocate for resources that will help every 
ECC in this country implement the same life-saving 
technologies.
    As 9-1-1 centers handle higher call volume for increasingly 
extreme and dire circumstances, publicly available 
communications technologies have substantially outpaced the 
legacy communications technologies still used by most 9-1-1 
systems across this country.
    Because most 9-1-1 systems were originally built using 
analog rather than digital technologies, ECCs need to be 
upgraded to a digital or IP-based 9-1-1 system. This is 
commonly referred to as Next Gen 9-1-1. It will allow videos, 
texts, and photos and other data to flow seamlessly from the 
public to the 9-1-1 network to partnering agencies and our 
field responders.
    Richer and potentially real-time information shared with 
first responders from ECCs Next Gen systems to FirstNet will be 
a critical improvement that can ensure they are better informed 
and operate more safely in big cities, small ones, and rural 
communities.
    In sum, FirstNet and Next Gen 9-1-1 are complementary 
initiatives. When coordinated, we can greatly improve the 
provision of public safety communications between the public, 
9-1-1, and our first responders.
    Thank you for your consideration of my testimony today 
regarding FirstNet and the 9-1-1 industry. I look forward to 
answering any of the questions you may have.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Holmes follows:]

            Prepared Statement of Karima Holmes, Director, 
                    Office of Unified Communications
    Good morning Chairman Wicker, Subcommittee Chair Thune, Ranking 
Member Senator Schatz, Senator Cantwell, other distinguished 
subcommittee members, staff, guests and viewing public. My name is 
Karima Holmes and I am the Director of Washington, DC's Office of 
Unified Communications (OUC), which is the city's Emergency 
Communications Center (ECC) or consolidated 9-1-1/3-1-1 center. I am 
proud to sit before you today representing one of the over 6,500 ECCs 
across the Nation. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to highlight 
the vital role that the 9-1-1 center plays in creating a comprehensive 
and truly seamless first responder network. Today's ECCs are public 
safety communications nerve centers that have evolved extensively 
beyond early iterations and have become dynamic and highly technical 
operations capable of quickly processing an immense volume of 
datapoints to ensure both first responder safety and the most efficient 
and appropriate response to emergencies. In a very real sense, 9-1-1 
call takers and dispatchers are the first-first responders. It is with 
profound respect for my colleagues in this profession that I offer my 
testimony today.
    Before I continue, I would also like to state for the record that I 
was appointed to the FirstNet Authority Board in October 2019. However, 
my testimony today will only reflect my perspective as the District of 
Columbia's 9-1-1 Director and will be based on the expertise I honed 
during my decades-long career at the helm of ECCs in the states of 
Georgia, Texas, and the Nation's capital, as well as through my 
extensive industry engagement with 9-1-1 advocacy groups such as the 
Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials, the National 
Association of State 911 Administrators and the National Emergency 
Number Association.
    The essential mission of the District's 9-1-1 center, the Office of 
Unified Communications, is to provide accurate, professional and 
expedited emergency and non-emergency call management for the District 
of Columbia while maintaining radio interoperability between 27 local, 
regional and Federal first responder agencies and other partners in the 
District and across the National Capital Region (NCR).
    The OUC operates and maintains 10 radio tower sites, over 8,000 
radios for the city's police, fire and emergency medical services 
personnel, along with a regional cache of close to 1,000 radios which 
are deployed for planned events like Inauguration and unplanned 
occurrences such as protests or major weather systems, as well as 
thousands of first responder mobile data computing units, and other 
handheld devices. All told, the District's ECC processes over 3 million 
9-1-1 and 3-1-1 calls and 12 million push to-talk radio transmissions 
annually. Understanding the critical importance of maintaining secure 
and reliable connectivity for this vast operation, the District of 
Columbia began testing broadband-type solutions for public safety over 
ten years ago. And when FirstNet launched, my ECC was quick to 
subscribe.
    More recently, we completely overhauled our technical 
infrastructure, software platforms and critical programs by completing 
a telephony system upgrade, introducing Text-to-911 and executing 
criteria based dispatching protocols among other improvements. These 
enhancements, coupled with the FirstNet platform and FirstNet powered 
devices deployed and maintained by my agency, the District has been 
better able to provide informed responses to incidents through 
FirstNet's reliable, integrated communications network.
    In fact, as the Nation grappled with the far-reaching demands 
brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser 
commissioned me to leverage the full extent our capabilities to enact 
methods that would safeguard my staff while maintaining the District's 
public safety lifeline without interruption. Immediately, I spread my 
staff out between our worksites and transitioned some of my teams to 
operate remotely. MiFi devices powered by FirstNet have enabled my 
entire administrative staff, my 3-1-1 agents and my non-emergency 9-1-1 
call taking operation to telework using a secure, reliable connection, 
from their homes.
    Having a secure network--knowing that the critical information that 
we are processing related to literally hundreds of incidents per hour--
from the caller, to the call taker, to police and fire and emergency 
medical responders in the field in the most secure manner possible--is 
not negotiable. These are high stakes circumstances and FirstNet has 
made this a reality for my ECC, without condition. The District and its 
stakeholders have benefited greatly from the bold innovation of the 
FirstNet Authority.
    Due primarily to its physical proximity to and responsibility for 
providing public safety communications services for the seat of 
government, the District of Columbia's ECC operates with a unique 
advantage over most other ECCs in terms of resources and support. I 
would be remiss not to recognize this privilege and use this 
opportunity to advocate for resources that will help every ECC in this 
country implement the same lifesaving technologies.
    With that said, I would also like to mention that this is a pivotal 
time for all ECCs across the US. As 9-1-1 centers handle higher call 
volume for increasingly extreme and dire circumstances, the public 
safety communications industry has been collectively engaged in 
determining how all 9-1-1 centers can best execute their missions to 
serve as the vital link between the public and first responders. As you 
may know, publicly available communications technologies have 
substantially outpaced the legacy communications technologies still 
used by most 9-1-1 systems across the country.
    Because most 9-1-1 systems were originally built using analog 
rather than digital technologies, ECCs need to be upgraded to a digital 
or Internet Protocol (IP)-based 9-1-1 system, commonly referred to as 
Next Generation 9-1-1 (NG911) to allow photos, videos and text messages 
to flow seamlessly from the public to the 9-1-1 network.
    While the technology to implement these new IP-based 9-1-1 systems 
is available now, the collective transition to NG911 in states and 
counties nationwide will require the support, coordination and 
dedicated resources from legislative and governing entities, in keeping 
with the Next Generation 9-1-1 Act of 2019.
    It is clear within the 9-1-1 industry that this more robust, 
mobile-and digitally adapted system will revolutionize how the public 
can communicate in emergencies thereby creating a greater degree of 
public safety across the Nation. Richer and potentially real-time 
information shared with first responders through the FirstNet network 
would be a critical improvement that can ensure that they are better 
informed and operate more safely, in big cities and in rural 
communities. In sum, FirstNet and NG911 are complementary initiatives, 
and if coordinated, can greatly improve the provision of public safety 
communications between the public, 9-1-1 and first responders.
    Thank you for your consideration of my testimony regarding FirstNet 
and the 9-1-1 industry. I look forward to answering any questions that 
you may have at this time.

    Senator Thune. Thank you, Ms. Holmes.
    We'll get right into questions and I'll start. As I 
mentioned in my home state of South Dakota, we have several 
public safety entities on the FirstNet network, as you heard 
Captain Harrison reference.
    However, there are also many agencies that are supported by 
other communications providers which is why ensuring the 
interoperability between public safety agencies was a 
fundamental objective in establishing FirstNet.
    So the question is, and I'll direct this to you, Mr. 
Parkinson, what steps has FirstNet taken or does it plan to 
take to ensure that its users can communicate effectively with 
public safety agencies that use networks other than FirstNet, 
the FirstNet/AT&T network?
    Mr. Parkinson. Thank you, Senator.
    The key around this is the vision that Congress established 
back in 2012 when the legislation was passed and what we found 
in the legislation is that Congress was looking to deploy a 
nationwide interoperable network and the biggest risk we saw at 
the time was that you would have states that chose not to adopt 
the FirstNet platform. They would choose to opt out, use a 
different technology, and that would have to interconnect with 
the NPSBN, the National Public Safety Broadband Network, 
FirstNet.
    Luckily, as a result of the work in coordinating our 
efforts with the states and working together with public 
safety, every single state and territory and the District of 
Columbia chose to opt into the network and as a result, we now 
have a single nationwide interoperable network.
    In terms of other carriers and other users from different 
systems, really anything that we have internally at FirstNet is 
prioritized based on local control. That means that that 
agency, that local incident commander has the power and, 
frankly, the control to choose how to operate the system. 
That's for all incoming calls, data, any uses whatsoever.
    There's nothing that a user has to do and there's nothing 
that a user has to allow for prioritization or preemption to 
occur. It's just inherent in the system and that is unique to 
FirstNet.
    It's all on the agency. They set these needs based on their 
requirements and as far as connectivity to other non-FirstNet 
users is concerned, all FirstNet users can call, text, send 
data packages, similar to if you were on one system on your 
commercial device and I was on a different one, we could do the 
same thing. We could communicate with one another. That is what 
happens at FirstNet and it's all because we've based this 
network on global standards. That was a requirement in the 
statute and that's something that we've followed to the T.
    So the data package comes in from one carrier, from a 
different user. It just works on FirstNet. We don't care where 
it comes from. It just works and it has priority preemption on 
the FirstNet system.
    So when one considers the congressional plan and the vision 
regarding opt-in and opt-out, we have interoperability through 
that and from the technology perspective, we have full 
interoperability.
    Senator Thune. So how is FirstNet ensuring that all public 
safety agencies, regardless of the network there that they use, 
can fully utilize the applications that are important to their 
mission?
    Mr. Parkinson. It's such an important part. When we were 
developing the RFP, we set out to set up 16 core objectives, 
one of which was the development of an application ecosystem. 
We set up an app developer's program which would allow for 
folks who were interested in deploying and creating apps 
specific for public safety to submit those into our app catalog 
so that public safety users who were on the FirstNet system 
could then download those applications that are much more 
secure than we've seen elsewhere and they can leverage them 
day-in and day-out.
    So currently we have just north of a 130 applications on 
the FirstNet ecosystem and that's growing. That's continuing. 
We've seen that growing with many years to come and to be a 
FirstNet user, you get access to those and that's unique. 
Again, having that app catalog, that is unique and from any 
other carrier you see across the nation, and it's something 
that we're very, very proud of.
    Senator Thune. Thank you.
    Mr. Harrison, in your testimony, you talked about the 
coverage of the FirstNet network in the Black Hills which 
contains a lot of Federal land, and in addition to burdens of 
deploying infrastructure in those areas because of the terrain, 
there are also greater regulatory burdens that carriers face 
when building out networks on Federal lands.
    So I'm wondering maybe if you could talk about the 
importance of having reliable coverage in these areas and the 
benefits of streamlining the build-out in that region.
    Captain Harrison. Yes, sir, Senator. I thank you for the 
question.
    Coverage is critical. We go in the Black Hills, like I was 
saying awhile ago. It's so vast, but there are places you lose 
complete total cell reception. Even radio reception, we can 
lose, and so when we talk about the build-out, you know, since 
two of the towers that we're really looking at building right 
now, the ones in the Hill City area near Deerfield and near 
Tree Fort, are on Federal land, there is a little extra red 
tape to go through and so that's one of the lowdowns because 
the building the tower, the physical structure, is not the hard 
part. The hard part is all the fiscal stuff and getting land 
and property and all that stuff handled before.
    So I would say for us time is the enemy, because the more 
times we have to have meetings or have to have another hearing 
on something that we can build on that just delays the back end 
of what we're looking for.
    An example I can give you is just a couple days ago, we 
were working a homicide Investigation in one of our area lakes 
and there was no ability for me to communicate with the 
sergeants that were on scene dealing with that, the scene, 
because there's no cell coverage and it's just with the lay of 
the land.
    But I will tell you that position of those officers and the 
detectives were standing in 2 days ago was less than five miles 
from the build site that's being planned. So the delay in 
getting that built hurt us yesterday and I'm hoping that won't 
hurt us tomorrow. We can get that build done as soon as 
possible so the citizens of our county can have the service 
they need.
    Senator Thune. Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Harrison.
    Mr. Porter, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an 
unprecedented amount of traffic on our communications networks 
and I believe we should continue to encourage more investment 
by the private sector in our communications infrastructure and 
when building out the FirstNet network.
    Let me ask what regulatory hurdles have you faced and what 
steps can Congress take to facilitate the deployment of 
reliable broadband networks?
    Mr. Porter. Thanks, Senator. So the pandemic, as you point 
out, has shown the importance of broadband and particularly why 
FirstNet was founded and its importance to public safety.
    It's also reinforced the need for rural coverage and 
capabilities which is a foundational element of FirstNet and 
so, first, I want to thank this committee and, Senator, you, 
for your efforts to expand broadband coverage, particularly 
with the Streamline Act.
    Our biggest challenge, as the Captain pointed out, is 
access. The time it takes to gain access, it's a challenge at 
the local, the state, and the Federal level, and, in 
particular, Federal lands are a challenge to build. They can 
take years to get access and rights to be able to go dig the 
trench or build the tower and so it's that time of approval 
that is the biggest challenge for us in continuing to deploy 
and cover Rural America.
    I appreciate this committee's efforts to streamline access 
and approval procedures to help improve rural broadband.
    Senator Thune. Thank you. And as Captain Harrison pointed 
out in a very real-world way that those delays and the 
bureaucracy and red tape associated with getting all that 
necessary approval just really does delay the implementation of 
these in critical areas of the places around the country where 
we really need it.
    I'll turn now to Senator Schatz for his questions.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for 
great testimony.
    The first question I have for Mr. Parkinson, and I 
apologize if you mentioned this, but what's the time-frame for 
the full build-out?
    Mr. Parkinson. So we signed a contract with AT&T back in 
2017, in March, and as part of the contract, we have a 25-year 
contract with AT&T, and there's an initial five-year deployment 
through multiple phases that ends in March 2023, and so the 
state plans that the State of Hawaii, the State of South 
Dakota, and all 50 states and territories and D.C. adopted, 
that was related to that initial five-year deployment which is 
due to end in March 2023.
    Of course, there are an additional 20 years for us to make 
strategic investments in areas, such as coverage and expanding 
the network, but as I said, initial deployment March 2023.
    Senator Schatz. So that's my question. I get that the sort 
of contract period is 5 years, but in my mind's eye, if I'm 
imagining what the Sheriff is talking about, which is pretty 
much total connectivity with some very minor exceptions, when 
do you think it's realistic to hit that goal?
    Mr. Parkinson. I think, sir, the key here is the 
operability and the access to information, the access to data. 
I think the stories that you see coming from public safety 
across the Nation do show a dramatic increase in the abilities 
and the capabilities from a broadband perspective that FirstNet 
has been able to provide teams.
    We know that this is a situation that we have to 
continually upgrade the network on. We have to expand coverage. 
We have to bring new technologies to public safety so that they 
can do their jobs better and more efficiently and to try and 
keep us safer. So----
    Senator Schatz. OK. So not so binary as connected versus 
not connected because part of this is going to be you sort of 
have gradations of connectivity and you do work-arounds and all 
the rest of it.
    Ms. Holmes, thank you for your service in Washington, D.C. 
Thank you for trying your very best to keep us safe.
    I want to talk to you about Next Gen 9-1-1 and its 
potential, but I also wonder how worried we should be about the 
ability to sort of hijack the process and flood the system to 
the point where people can't sort out what is sort of 
malfeasance in the cyber space.
    Ms. Holmes. Thank you, Senator. So I think that we all lose 
sleep, I've lost sleep on cybersecurity and how that looks in 
the 9-1-1 space. I think what Next Gen 9-1-1, what you have is 
a graduated space that we are attempting to do across the 
country with close to 7,000 pace acts but we're all doing it 
differently.
    And so the goal with the unified national Next Gen 9-1-1 is 
to basically put us all on the same path with the same 
standards and headed toward the same goal.
    Basically right now, the public has IP networks, right? You 
can order a pizza from Dominos. They know where you are before 
you even know where you are.
    FirstNet has come to fruition and basically done what it 
promised to do and it's allowing our first responders to stay 
connected. It's allowing the 9-1-1 center to stay connected to 
the first responders, but we do have a piece in there that is 
not being coordinated in the way we want and that piece is from 
the caller to the responder which is where I come in and that's 
what Next Gen 9-1-1 is.
    Part of the planning with Next Gen 9-1-1 is not only just 
the 9-1-1 call, text, data, you're talking about transferring 
calls to other pace acts. I get about 55,000 calls in the 
District that belong to one of my border states because they're 
coming in to my 9-1-1 center. We have to transfer it out.
    Unfortunately, right now with our technology, we're only 
transferring out the voice. I can't transfer the address. I 
can't transfer anything else and so with Next Gen 9-1-1 you 
would get that, but there has been much planning across the 
states, regions. We have a regional approach here in D.C. that 
does address things like cyber-security. How do we transfer 
these calls? How do we train?
    I think one of the key things that you brought up was the 
influx of data and what type of information we get, not only if 
there are any type of egregious acts, but how do we mine that 
data and give it out to our responders, and so Next Gen 9-1-1 
encompasses all of that.
    It's much more than the technology. It's about the training 
our people and so basically what I said in my testimony is 
that, you know, we have to have some type of national cohesive 
process going forward with it, and it's not that no one knows 
that we need to do it. Everyone is in agreement across the 
industry that we need to do it. It's just that the resources 
and the coordination is not there.
    Senator Schatz. And just a final point of clarification.
    When we in Congress think about funding Next Gen 9-1-1, 
that's going to be hardware, software training?
    Ms. Holmes. Yes. So 911.gov, which is out of the Highway 
and Transportation Agency, I believe, they did a cost study a 
couple years ago and that cost study shows what it will cost 
for the entire infrastructure for 9-1-1 in the Nation to 
progress to Next Gen 9-1-1. That includes everything.
    We're talking about the plug in the wall, the training, the 
governance, the MOUs, all of that process, software, and 
everything, so yes. It would be from literally end to end.
    Senator Schatz. Thanks very much.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Schatz.
    When Ms. Holmes was talking about the 55,000 calls she gets 
from border states, that's a lot of calls coming in from next 
door and an issue that Senator Schatz doesn't have to worry as 
much about in his home state probably.
    Next up is Senator Fischer from Nebraska. Senator Fischer 
joining us remotely.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DEB FISCHER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA

    Senator Fischer. Are we OK?
    Senator Thune. We hear you, yes. We don't see you but we 
hear you.
    Senator Fischer. OK. Thank you.
    Senator Thune. There you go.
    Senator Fischer. Captain Harrison, among rural 
stakeholders, there has been some apprehension about FirstNet's 
reliance on what is referred to as deployable networks in rural 
areas versus deploying a fixed network.
    I noticed that your agency may use one type of deployable, 
the cell on wings known as C-O-Ws.
    How did the functioning of this work in your experience, 
and were first responder communications adequately supported?
    Captain Harrison. Thank you, Senator, for that question.
    The answer is the COWs, cells on wheels, worked awesome. 
The example I'll give you is last fall, we had an elk hunter 
that went missing and she was in an area that was near 
Deerfield Lake, which is extremely--has no cell coverage. 
There's absolutely zero cell coverage where we were. And so we 
called FirstNet and within probably 12 to 14 hours, they had a 
mobile cell tower there that we were able to fully communicate 
back and forth with, back in dispatch which is obviously 
important in having that communication, and so their COW again 
made our work so much easier.
    It would not have been able to have been done as easily as 
it was if we had not had that and the timely response was 
perfect for us and so if I could say, to answer your question 
how was it, we found it to be extremely wonderful.
    And the thing about it is there's supposed to be a tower 
built there and that's kind of we're waiting for the Federal 
land stuff to go through, like what we talked about, but in the 
short time, the COW was perfect.
    Senator Fischer. Great. Thank you. In my part of the state, 
we have a lot of COWs but they don't have wings.
    Mr. Porter, I am pleased to hear from Nebraska stakeholders 
that FirstNet build-out in our state is proceeding ahead of 
schedule. During last year's floods in Nebraska, FirstNet 
deployed a SatCOLT to assist with FEMA operations.
    How does FirstNet ensure the appropriate deployables are 
where they need to be for unplanned events?
    Mr. Porter. Thank you, Senator.
    Yes, so our deployables, first of all go along with our 
commitment to be where public safety needs us when they need us 
and that can be, as Captain Harrison just said, maybe in a 
remote location, a search and rescue mission, or, as you can 
see behind me, we deploy our SatCOLTs, in the fires out West 
and also in Cameron, Louisiana, after a hurricane.
    So we've got a mix of SatCOLTs. We've got 72 deployables on 
wheels and we've got deployables on wings that are drones and 
then we also have our blimp, as well, that is FirstNet One. 
They can provide sustained coverage of an area.
    So we've got the opportunity to provide the necessary tool 
to the environment and what we do is we work locally hand-in-
hand with public safety within the state and local communities 
to prioritize where are these assets, where they are moving.
    In fact, on the ground in the wildfires right now, we're 
working hand-in-hand with FEMA as they're directing at the 
Federal level with individual fire camps as they're talking 
about where they need coverage and so we've got a lot of 
opportunity to continue to grow this fleet, which we're doing 
at FirstNet's direction, and we're very excited to be able to 
provide these capabilities to public safety.
    Senator Fischer. And also, Mr. Porter, in terms of how 
FirstNet is assisting with other critical communications, such 
as at Offutt Air Force Base and with the Buffalo County Hazmat 
Team, would you expand on those latest efforts in Nebraska?
    Mr. Porter. Yes. Great, Senator. Yes. So Offutt Air Force 
Base is a great example of our continued innovation and what 
we're doing with public safety and with the community.
    It's important to remember that the Department of Defense 
provides tremendous mutual aid to the communities outside of 
the military installation and so they work hand-in-hand 
together and so the FirstNet capabilities on the military 
installation in support of that also cross the lines and help 
the communities around.
    So at Air Force Base Offutt there in your home state, it's 
a continuation of what we saw in Tindall and Nellis Air Force 
Bases. When we went and renovated those Air Force bases, arming 
them with 5G and upgrading them and modernizing them, we are 
now delivering that to three more additional Air Force bases, 
as you mentioned, Offutt in your home state, and so we're very 
excited about the opportunity to modernize with the Air Force 
and with the Department of Defense in general. So thank you.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Fischer.
    Senator Blackburn.

              STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE

    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you 
to our witnesses.
    I think that having a good dependable FirstNet system is 
something we all want and, Mr. Porter, I want to chat with you 
for just a second.
    We had some pretty bad tornadoes in Tennessee this year and 
I'd like to ask you--I know AT&T has a very strong presence in 
Tennessee--what kind of impediments did you see to re-
establishing your networks in the wake of the tornadoes and 
what did you hear from AT&T customers in the area and was your 
FirstNet integration able to meet the needs? Was it adequate 
during that time?
    Mr. Porter. Great question, Senator Blackburn, and, yes, 
the tornadoes in Tennessee were tragic and we were a part of 
that recovery.
    In fact, I think you'll find as you ask public safety the 
real strength of FirstNet is that we're there when they need us 
most after those disasters. So in the wake of that tornado, we 
were quickly on the ground. We position our response operations 
group and the deployable assets in positions so that we can 
come in immediately following that. We stage them across the 
country so that they can get anywhere they're needed very 
rapidly and the FirstNet Authority provides oversight to make 
sure that happens.
    And so it was a dramatic response and I will tell you the 
public safety community was extremely thankful. They were 
pleased. They consistently told us we went above and beyond the 
mission. We met their needs. We don't just show up with 
deployables at these times.
    I was on the ground in Louisiana after the hurricane and 
just like that in Tennessee. We're there providing devices. 
We're sometimes providing water and meals and helping these 
communities.
    Senator Blackburn. Let me ask you this. What about 
FirstNet's capabilities in the rural areas and the remote 
areas?
    Mr. Porter. Yes. Great question. So in Tennessee, for 
example, we're on air with new towers in Macon, Jackson, 
Pickett, Bledsoe, Overton, Rutherford, Claiborne, Fentress, 
Hancock, Warren, Polk, and Grundy Counties, and we've deployed 
Band 14 in Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Fayette, Guiles, and 
Morey, Tennessee, and we've got more coming.
    So we're providing a layer of permanent service in both 
rural and non-rural sites, and we are measured for our build to 
deploy both rural and non-rural, and then we supplement that 
with our deployables to make sure that we can reach every area 
within Tennessee or across the country.
    Senator Blackburn. Sure. OK. Let me ask you one more thing 
before my time runs out.
    Ms. Holmes was talking about the Next Gen 9-1-1, which I 
think is vitally important. So where are you all on having a 
more innovative ecosystem for our first responders in these 
areas where we don't have high-speed Internet or we don't have 
cell service or we're just remote and unserved? Talk to me a 
little bit about that because AT&T still has large gaps in 
their fiber or their high-speed Internet systems even in 
suburban areas. Believe you me, I know firsthand about this 
one. So where are you all on building out that ecosystem?
    Mr. Porter. Yes. As was mentioned before, over 125 
applications in our application ecosystem. We've got compelling 
and exciting ways that we're working with PSAPs, like Ms. 
Holmes is, to help them use FirstNet.
    In fact, we have an application here that was used in a 
fire I'll show you in a rural area and essentially what it is 
is it's an application that shows where the fire is. You can 
communicate with everybody on the ground. You can see the 
assets, your own assets and people moving, and so it's a 
situational awareness app that was only possible through a 
broadband network and anybody who goes to that fire, whether 
it's mutual aid from across the country, they can access this 
and you can see everyone moving. Even the FirstNet assets show 
up on that application.
    So this is a great example of where we're working with 
public safety every day and we're using their innovation and 
our technology to help better the abilities of public safety on 
the ground.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you so much. Yield back.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Blackburn.
    I'm going to turn momentarily to Senator Blumenthal who is 
here, but I do want to ask a question, if I might, as he gets 
ready, and that's this is for Mr. Parkinson and Mr. Porter, but 
in its most recent report, which I alluded to earlier, the GAO 
had found that there was limited information and insights about 
FirstNet's user experiences.
    So could you perhaps speak to what steps you have taken to 
address this concern?
    Mr. Parkinson. Thank you, Senator. We appreciate the GAO 
and the diligent work that they've done.
    We received a lot of positive feedback as a result of that 
and we take the relationship we have with the GAO very 
seriously. We felt that the report was very good and accurate 
and we took steps in preempting that report but also as a 
result of it, one thing we've done is we've drawn from the 
public safety community. We have a dedicated team of public 
safety advocacy groups whose sole responsibility is to engage 
with public safety in the field, to receive feedback from them, 
to push information out to.
    We've also drawn in and have on staff a number of public 
safety professionals from various disciplines that we have that 
integrate public safety knowledge in the organization.
    Just this week on our website, we've updated a portal, a 
new portal where public safety users can go and submit data 
through our website, and I encourage everyone to go to 
firstnet.gov who are FirstNet users, so that we can gather 
additional information.
    Over the coronavirus pandemic, we've had a great 
opportunity to engage through webinars and through other 
virtual events and we're very proud about the interaction we 
have with public safety.
    I think you can always do more and understanding the 
evolving needs of public safety is an important part of that 
and we continue to evolve how we engage with public safety.
    So all in all, I'm proud of the work we've done but 
obviously look forward to doing more public safety.
    Senator Thune. Mr. Porter? Thank you.
    Mr. Porter. Yes, Senator. Just to add on, you know, at 
AT&T, we're excited to work with FirstNet on the 
recommendations and implement those. As Mr. Parkinson said, 
we've always got opportunity to improve.
    I will, though, say that the success of FirstNet shows the 
demand and the excitement in public safety for FirstNet. We're 
just over 2 years in the market and we already have 1.5 million 
connections and we have 13,000 agencies that have signed up 
with public safety and as Senator Blackburn pointed out, when 
you are there on the ground in Cameron, Louisiana, or on Mexico 
Beach, Florida, or in the Hills of South Dakota, and you're the 
only coverage and people are in desperate situations, those are 
extremely powerful connections and strong connections, and I 
will tell you after those events, we have seen tremendous 
momentum and acquisition to FirstNet.
    Senator Thune. Thank you.
    Senator Blumenthal.

             STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT

    Senator Blumenthal. Thanks, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for 
holding this very important hearing.
    When Congress first created FirstNet, we were responding to 
the communications breakdowns that occurred in previous 
national emergencies, as you know. I think we had our first 
test of this system during the COVID-19 pandemic.
    During this process, I've heard that your teams have been 
responsive to Connecticut's questions and I appreciate it that 
FirstNet has been able to support EAO and other medical centers 
in their response to the pandemic. I hope that this close 
collaboration will continue as Connecticut adopts and builds on 
FirstNet and this health crisis continues unfortunately.
    I wonder if you could tell me, Number One, what resources 
are immediately available for Connecticut's medical centers and 
others on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic?
    I appreciate that AT&T has built out new tower sites in 
Litchfield and Fairfield Counties for FirstNet, but there's 
still more coverage needed. How are you coordinating with 
Connecticut's first responders about where to locate new 
towers, and as you know, GAO reported that some stakeholders 
describe having little contact with FirstNet or receiving 
insufficient information from FirstNet and AT&T.
    For those in Connecticut who need answers from FirstNet and 
who might need, for example, a satellite truck to ensure 
access, who should they turn to and what assurances are there 
that they will receive sufficient information and the right 
support?
    Mr. Porter. Thank you, Senator. So appreciate your 
comments.
    We've been very focused on working with the local and state 
leadership there in your home state and we're excited and 
pleased that you've been receiving good reports.
    I'll tell you, you mentioned Litchfield and Fairfield, 
we've also added Band 14 capability, the dedicated public 
safety spectrum, for your public safety community to Hartford, 
Bridgeport, New Haven, New London, Norwich, Litchfield, and 
Windom.
    And you asked what could we do to help the health care 
workers on the frontline during this pandemic. I will tell you 
we are on the frontlines, as well, with you. We're donning our 
PPE and going out and serving field hospitals, quarantine 
sites, and test facilities, and so we're right there with you, 
and that's where we learn the most and get the best information 
is by working side-by-side with public safety, and some of the 
unique things you get with FirstNet.
    First of all, the public health workers there get all of 
the assets, all of the capabilities of FirstNet, but some 
unique things they get. In our device ecosystem, we now have 
over 150 devices in our device ecosystem. We even have a device 
that you can drop into Clorox and pull back out for full 
disinfection and protection of the health care worker on the 
frontline.
    We've got apps, as you heard, in the app ecosystem. We have 
apps that as you're requesting mutual aid and they're moving 
into the area, you can get statistics and information that 
tells you the local environment as you're heading into that 
area. So we've got tremendous capabilities and we're continuing 
to work with public safety.
    As far as communications, as I mentioned, the way that we 
continue to get better and improve for public safety is working 
hand-in-hand with the folks, the great leaders that are on the 
ground there doing the heroic work in Connecticut.
    We spend countless hours with them learning and 
understanding where they want connectivity, what they need, 
what they want us to prioritize, and how we can help them 
better.
    Mr. Parkinson. Senator, if I may just add, one additional 
tool that we have is on our website, firstnet.gov, on the 
FirstNet Authority site, there are dropdown menus where every 
single public safety official is able to identify from their 
state the FirstNet Authority's point of contact and so his or 
her contact information is up there, both e-mail and cell 
phone, and that's just another great resource that public 
safety has in order to push information out to us and ensure 
that their voice is heard in the system.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you both. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Blumenthal.
    Next up is Senator Capito remotely. Senator Capito.

            STATEMENT OF HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA

    Senator Capito. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Have 
you got me? Am I good?
    Senator Thune. We've got you. You're on.
    Senator Capito. All right. Great. Thank you for the hearing 
today.
    I was really pleased in May 2019 to be able to see FirstNet 
put their tower site up in Kingwood, West Virginia. I also saw 
the demonstration of their FirstNet satellite cell on light 
trucks which was one of their first deployable network assets, 
and my understanding has been that since we had that meeting 
with FirstNet with the (audio glitch) has been very, very good.
    So I'm curious to know, Mr. Parkinson, first of all, let's 
see here. I don't know what to do. I'm hoping I'm OK. They just 
asked me a question. Let me start it over again. OK. Am I OK?
    Senator Thune. Yes, ma'am. We can hear you.
    Senator Capito. All right. How ironic that I'm having these 
issues. I'm having to be at home because I'm quarantining.
    I'm wanting to know, Mr. Parkinson, in short, has there 
been much disruption because of COVID? How have you all handled 
that, and are you able to say that you're on target to meet 
your goals that you set forward in your roadmap?
    Mr. Parkinson. Senator, thank you.
    The roadmap is the key component of what we do at FirstNet. 
We unveiled it in August of last year and it comprises really 
six core areas that we look at from the public safety 
perspective.
    It provides us the blueprint for where we're going to go 
from investment and we are looking to update that sometime next 
month. It's a goal we have to continually update that as we see 
with public safety. Just as similar technology evolves, as will 
our roadmap will in the direction we go.
    We are very happy with the amount of information that we've 
been able to push out to public safety. Again, it's been tricky 
not being able to travel to visit with folks in person, but all 
in all, we're very pleased with the progress we've made so far, 
but look forward to making additional progress in the future.
    Senator Capito. Thank you. Mr. Porter, let me ask a 
question. When we went out to the site, I lost cell service on 
my way out there. These are remote sites, as many of the sites 
that you've talked about and our witnesses have talked about, 
as well.
    So as we look at what's happened for the need of rural 
broadband that this committee works a lot on, do you see any 
role at all where FirstNet could help, not just our first 
responders, but then push out further from those spots more 
broadband deployment as we seek to get to those more remote 
homes, businesses, and other areas in the communities?
    Mr. Porter. Great question, Senator. First of all, thank 
you for being at that site and helping us participate in the 
ribbon-cutting. We appreciate it.
    Senator Capito. Thanks for the opportunity.
    Mr. Porter. Yes. And we're very excited about the coverage 
that we've provided there in West Virginia. Obviously a bunch 
of rural area there, as well, where we've put Band 14 in 
Huntington, Ashland, Monongahela, Charleston, and Parkersburg, 
Marietta, and we've also hit with new sites, we've established 
Hardy, Raleigh, Preston, and Mineral Counties.
    So we're hard at work there in West Virginia, and we 
appreciate your support.
    In reference to how we can help every time we go and deploy 
a Band 14 radio, it certainly helps public safety, but there 
are also secondary benefits for the local community and that 
happens in two ways.
    Number One, when we hang the Band 14 radio, when that 
network is not congested or we're seeing a high traffic 
situation, the local community can join that band as a 
secondary user and partake in the additional coverage provided 
by Band 14.
    Additionally, as a company, AT&T has decided that our 
method when we deploy a Band 14 radio, we do something we call 
a single touch climb, which means that we will go up and add 
commercial spectrum to that tower oftentimes when we're 
deploying a Band 14 radio. So now the local community gets the 
benefit of their own commercial network as well as the benefit 
of Band 14 when it's not in use or in a high-capacity 
situation.
    Senator Capito. Well, that's precisely where my interest 
lies. I mean, I think we have opportunities here to get to 
those last spaces and I think the utilization off of the, as 
you said, climb once or however you characterized it might be 
one of those.
    The last question I want to ask is on--well, I see my time 
has expired. So I did have a question on hot spots because our 
Governor is creating hot spots for our educational delivery.
    Is that a technology that FirstNet uses at all in any form 
or fashion? I'm curious to know about that.
    Mr. Porter. So, Senator, yes, it is one of our assets we 
use. In fact, we often use it in emergency situations. We have 
an array of solutions, as I mentioned, from deployables on 
wheels to deployables on wings and blimps, but we also have 
generators and hot spots and routers and switches and for me 
personally, I was in Calcasieu, Louisiana, shortly after that 
hurricane hit, and literally walked into a sheriff's department 
and they were operating in an ag center for the short term 
because they couldn't get down to Cameron, Louisiana, because 
of the flooding, and so essentially we had to do what you just 
said.
    We essentially established communications with FirstNet and 
with a router so that they had local connectivity inside their 
facility. So we use all of our assets. We bring them all to 
bear to help public safety.
    Senator Capito. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, 
Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Capito, and we look 
forward to having you back from quarantine.
    Next up, if he's out there, is Senator Tester.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Senator Tester. I am, and thank you, Chairman Thune, and I 
appreciate the opportunity. I want to thank the panelists for 
joining us today.
    During my time on this committee, I have repeatedly raised 
concerns while cities across America will have access to 5G 
technology, folks in Rural America will be left with no G.
    This is a question for you, Mr. Parkinson. So, as FirstNet 
builds out their public safety network, they cannot leave 
anybody behind and, Mr. Parkinson, tell me how FirstNet will 
balance updating technology, ensuring that every corner of a 
state like mine will be covered?
    Mr. Parkinson. Thank you for the question, Senator.
    As part of the legislation that created FirstNet, there 
were significant rural milestones were laid out in the 
legislation and so when we were developing our procurement 
which ultimately AT&T bid on and won, as part of the contract 
with AT&T at every phase of the deployment, AT&T has to go out 
and deploy in rural parts of the state, not only in Montana but 
everywhere across the United States.
    This is something that we continue to monitor. So as Mr. 
Porter has referenced, the network's about 80 percent deployed. 
We have a certain amount of oversight that we need to ensure 
that AT&T meets the obligations that were adopted not only in 
the state plan but in the contract overall which those state 
plans are.
    I don't think--I can't stand here or sit here, rather, and 
say that every square inch of the United States is going to be 
covered. There's just no carrier will ever do that.
    What we can do, though, is taking advantage of the towers 
that are out there, the deployable assets, and identifying 
areas by working with public safety so that their needs can be 
met is the most important thing, and I think that's where the 
strength of a 25-year contract comes in.
    We're not stopping in 2023. This will continue and 
understanding the needs of public safety in Montana as well as 
those in other states and territories. We solicit that 
feedback. We bring it back into our strategic plan, feed it 
into our roadmap, and will make future investments. I think 
that's probably the best solution there.
    Senator Tester. So, Mr. Parkinson, what kind of metrics are 
you using to determine if they're meeting goals? Is it based on 
square miles? Is it based on population? What is it based on?
    Mr. Parkinson. Senator, we have a variety of assets and 
tools that we use, data that AT&T supplies us that we have to 
verify. There's also a certain amount of independent checking 
that we are also able to do and----
    Senator Tester. Just stop for a second. So the data that 
AT&T gives you, is it based off of maps that currently exist?
    Mr. Parkinson. Some of the data, AT&T has supplied state 
maps that are part of the state plan portal, and every user who 
was part of the Governor's decision to opt in can have access 
to that information.
    Senator Tester. How often do you check the accuracy of 
those maps which has been a big issue on this committee, by the 
way? The inaccuracy, not only--of all maps coming across the 
board when it talks to this kind of technology.
    Mr. Parkinson. Sure. The maps that we use, Senator, are 
specific to the FirstNet deployment and we have certain 
specifics in there that we continue to monitor. Our team is 
some of the best in the business in ensuring that where AT&T is 
meeting or exceeding their coverage, they do so.
    There have been times where the timeline where AT&T had 
planned to deploy didn't quite meet up with where we are. We 
discussed that and we found solutions to that. Ultimately when 
in 2023, the final operating procedure of this initial build is 
met, AT&T will have covered the contractual requirements that 
they have put out there as part of this.
    Senator Tester. I would just say this. I appreciate that 
answer and I think that you understand the issue.
    The key is, is that if we have a first responder network 
and you leave out Rural America, it's really not a first 
responder network, and so, look, I get it, there are not many 
people in certain areas of my state, but that doesn't make them 
any less important and so I just want you to keep that in mind 
moving forward.
    This next question is for Jason Porter from AT&T, and I am 
excited about AT&T's commitment to serving first responders 
throughout the country.
    The truth is, though, that AT&T's coverage in Montana has 
been heading in the wrong direction. There are big parts of 
Northeastern Montana where you used to be able to get AT&T 
service but today you cannot, and as AT&T works to make 
FirstNet available to first responders in those areas, tell me 
if consumers can expect to see coverage again.
    Mr. Porter. Thank you, Senator. I appreciate it, and, yes, 
as you mentioned, some of your state has some of the most 
challenging rural areas and we're committed and excited to 
improve coverage in those areas, and, you know, as Mr. 
Parkinson mentioned, we've got rigorous rural and non-rural 
commitments that we must meet.
    We also, as I mentioned in my oral, have a thousand 
purpose-built sites and those are largely in rural areas that 
we've committed to in the states and we've deployed 250 of 
those and so in Montana, we've already added new sites in 
Rosebud, Beaverhead, Stillwater, Mineral, and Hill Counties.
    We've also added Band 14 in Billings and Great Falls, and 
we're really excited about what we're doing in the tribal lands 
there because we have also added a FirstNet site to the 
Northern Cheyenne Reservation and we're excited about the 
future of our build plans there in Montana to continue to 
provide more and more coverage.
    So we are very committed and, as I mentioned, every time we 
deploy these sites, it benefits not just first responders. 
There are two distinct benefits for the general population. One 
of those is that every time we hang a Band 14 radio, the 
general public gets to access that spectrum as a secondary user 
when we are not in an emergency high-traffic event where 
capacity is limited.
    The other benefit for the general consumer is that when we 
climb a tower in most cases, we do what we call a single touch 
climb, which means we climb that tower, we hang the Band 14 
radio, and we also hang commercial radios so that the general 
population gets their commercial traffic and also can 
participate on the Band 14 radio when it's not congested.
    Senator Tester. Jason, I'm going to close really quick 
because I'm way past. I appreciate you guys putting up those 
towers. I really do. The one in Hill County is relatively close 
to where I live in Montana, but I'm not in Northeastern Montana 
and none of those towers you've mentioned are in Northeastern 
Montana.
    Thank you. Pay attention to those guys all across the 
state. It's important, the ones you put up. We also need to 
make sure the ones that don't have service get it back.
    Thank you very much.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Tester, and it is a big 
state.
    Next up is Senator Young, the Senator from Indiana.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. TODD YOUNG, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM INDIANA

    Senator Young. Thank you, Chairman.
    I'm going to continue with some of Senator Tester's line of 
questioning because I know it's your objective to try and serve 
as many Americans as possible through your network, urban areas 
and rural areas, and that comes with certain challenges, and 
you spoke a bit about how you're addressing those challenges. 
But why don't we turn to the state plans? You get state-by-
state plans to address this issue.
    Mr. Porter and Mr. Parkinson, how have AT&T and FirstNet 
worked with states like mine, Indiana, to identify coverage 
gaps that will help public safety agencies extend coverage out 
to where they need it?
    Mr. Parkinson. If I could take that first, Senator. So the 
state of Indiana is an incredibly powerful position and a very, 
very strong position because of two things. One, the statewide 
Interoperability and Integrated Public Safety Commission and 
the people that you have working on that.
    The statewide Interoperability Team, they really are 
leading the Nation in terms of their ability to integrate 
different systems. So in the state of Indiana, you have a 
statewide LMR system, walkie-talkie radio system, and it's been 
in existence for many, many years, and it's a very, very 
powerful tool.
    What the Commission has done in Indiana is they've 
connected their statewide radio system into the AT&T-enhanced 
push talk system demonstrating interoperability between these 
two systems, between Landrover radio and LTE, and that is just 
another tremendously powerful tool.
    It's the first state in the Nation to do that. I know the 
neighbors up in Michigan have been doing something similar, but 
that is, I think, another example of the power of broadband and 
what FirstNet can do. By integrating these two systems, you're 
expanding the ability for public safety to have communications 
in areas that they perhaps otherwise wouldn't have.
    I don't know if Jason has got anything to add to that.
    Mr. Porter. No. I just want to celebrate that, as well. 
What Mr. Parkinson said really is groundbreaking, and we 
appreciate your state for leaning in and it answers your 
question honestly about how we operate with your state.
    We operate by working hand-in-hand with them, whether it's 
for the creation of interoperability, new applications in the 
application ecosystem, new devices to our device ecosystem, or 
coverage. What we do is we roll up our sleeves. We walk the 
ground with public safety. We ask them what do they need and 
how can we serve them, and we try to deliver what they ask for 
as quickly as we possibly can, and so, you know, there are so 
many sites that we've added there in Indiana.
    Senator Young. Well, since Indiana is a national leader, as 
you've indicated, in this area, as we are in most other areas, 
it does beg the question, in all seriousness: are there other 
things that we in Congress should be doing to ensure that 
things continue to go smoothly across the country so that we 
might incentivize other states to adopt this model or a 
variance of this model and ensure that everyone has access to 
first responders--rural, urban, and everything in between?
    Mr. Porter. Senator, I will go first, and I welcome, you 
know, the other participants' comments, as well, but I'll give 
you a couple of areas.
    Number 1, and we talked about it early on, the Streamlining 
Act is a great opportunity for us to streamline, as we're 
trying to go into rural areas, like Montana.
    As was mentioned, Northeast Montana is hard to get into, 
Federal lands, getting approvals to go into those lands. If we 
can break down that red tape and those barriers so that we can 
deploy these sites more rapidly for your general population as 
well as for public safety, that's tremendous, and then as Ms. 
Holmes mentioned, I think continuing to focus on Next Gen 9-1-1 
and modernizing Next Gen 9-1-1.
    We are eager to work with Next Gen 9-1-1 providers. We 
already work with cloud-based CAD systems, like Rapid Deploy. 
If we can continue to progress Next Gen 9-1-1 at a rate that 
allows us to work together and modernize in unison that would 
help public safety tremendously.
    Senator Tester. Excellent. Thank you both, gentlemen, for 
being here today.
    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Young.
    And I think we have remotely right now Senator Rosen. 
Senator Rosen, are you there?

                STATEMENT OF HON. JACKY ROSEN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Rosen. I'm here.
    Senator Thune. OK.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it. I 
appreciate everyone for being here today and lots of exciting 
news on this front for sure. We absolutely need it.
    I want to speak a little bit about your deployment in 
Nevada because this past March, AT&T reported that FirstNet 
network deployment is 80 percent complete and the company is 
nearly a full year ahead of schedule on its network build. I 
really applaud these efforts.
    I think we can all agree that the COVID-19 pandemic has 
highlighted the urgent need to bridge the digital divide and 
ensure all Americans have access to reliable broadband 
internet.
    But in looking at the maps, various parts of Nevada have no 
coverage. About a third of my state has low coverage, 
especially in our rural and tribal communities, and according 
to my state's Department of Public Safety, AT&T plans to build 
out about 30 cell sites in Nevada in the next 6 months.
    So, Mr. Porter, first of all, I wonder if you could utilize 
existing cell sites, Number 1, but could you also provide us an 
update on the progress of building out this infrastructure? Has 
COVID-19 had an impact on your schedule? We know some parts 
were ahead, and where do you stand right now?
    Mr. Porter. Thank you, Senator. Appreciate it.
    We are, as we've stated in my oral, very excited to 
announce that we are about a year ahead of the build plan. 
We've surpassed that and continue to deploy very, very rapidly, 
and you asked whether COVID-19 is an impact.
    COVID-19 has been one of the biggest challenges for public 
safety that we've seen in our time. It's certainly been a 
challenge. As I mentioned, it's like a fire, flood, and tornado 
in every city across the country at the same time.
    It has not impacted our build, but it has proven in the 
need for a national public safety broadband network that 
provides agency interoperability. So what we've seen is as we 
go to cities and states, we see Federal, local, and state 
representatives working together hand-in-hand, law enforcement 
with fire, with EMS, and with medical. So it is going really, 
really well.
    In Nevada, as you mentioned, we've added sites in Reno. 
We've added sites in Las Vegas and Storey, and we've also 
supported some significant events. The Area 51 event in Alamo 
was one that strikes me, as I remember going out and having 
that deployment support, your communications in that area of 
your state.
    Senator Rosen. So do you have any time table for some of 
our more rural, remote, frontier communities about how quickly 
you might bring some more connectivity to them because our 
tribal areas and our rural areas are often--you talked about 
Area 51--fairly remote?
    Mr. Porter. Right, yes. So, yes, we work hand-in-hand with 
your state updating them on our plans, on our build status, and 
where we're at, and I can get back to you with the specifics of 
that build plan so you can see all the sites as they come in.
    Senator Rosen. Well, that's fantastic. Would you also--one 
of my questions was, is how you partner with our local 
communities when you select the locations of the new cell 
sites, your other infrastructure, and maybe all of you want to 
speak to that in the short time that we have left so that I can 
be sure when I'm talking to everyone across Nevada that they 
know how they can be part of the process to get on the list.
    Mr. Porter. Yes. That's great, and I'll go first and then 
I'll let Mr. Parkinson weigh in, but we do. We work every day 
with your state. Your state has established a state point of 
contact for FirstNet and we work exclusively or extremely well 
with your state and we're also working with public safety at 
large, so all the agencies and departments can funnel requests 
to us and through your POC, and so we do that to help 
prioritize and make sure we're building at the places that your 
state and your public safety teams need it the most.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you.
    Mr. Parkinson. And, Senator, from the FirstNet Authority 
side, we have on firstnet.gov a single page for every state 
which has the contact information of the FirstNet Authority 
representative who works in your state with his or her contact 
information, both e-mail and phone number. It's on 
firstnet.gov. I encourage all the public safety in Nevada and 
across the Nation to access that website to get that 
information so they can have the direct relationship with the 
FirstNet Authority.
    Senator Rosen. Well, thank you for putting that out there. 
We will make sure that those links are out for everyone in all 
of our communities, as well.
    I yield back my time. Thank you.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Rosen.
    I think we're going to wait just a minute here for Senator 
Cantwell to arrive.
    While we are, I would just ask both to you, Mr. Parkinson 
and to Mr. Porter. Mr. Parkinson, could you discuss how 
FirstNet plans to further improve its outreach and engagement 
with public safety stakeholders at the Federal, tribal, state, 
and local levels?
    And the follow up for Mr. Porter, you briefly mentioned 
AT&T's collaboration with rural providers to extend the 
FirstNet network to more rural and tribal areas. Could you talk 
about that further and what other steps you have taken to 
ensure that Rural America is not left behind without reliable 
broadband coverage?
    So, Mr. Parkinson, could you go first?
    Mr. Parkinson. Thank you, Senator.
    The interaction with public safety at every level across 
government is fundamental to the success of FirstNet. This, 
after all, is public safety's network, and when FirstNet 
engaged with public safety before the drafting of the RFP, we 
had to ensure that local public safety data was inputted into 
the RFP. So whoever the responders were, we're able to take 
tangible information from public safety and craft their 
responses to that because we know that public safety response 
to local emergencies and everything is local but everything can 
be different.
    You can't find uniform solutions from Northern Maine in the 
winter to Southern Florida in the winter. It's different 
solutions.
    So the network had to provide similar solutions that were 
applicable at the local level and that goes across the level 
from Federal, state, local, and this engagement that we have, 
leveraging our public safety advisory group and engaging at the 
Federal teams, we have a dedicated team whose sole purpose is 
to engage with Federal agencies, trying to identify 
partnerships where we can not only encourage folks to join the 
FirstNet system but, most importantly, to identify how we can 
partner with other Federal agencies.
    There are so many tremendous assets that are out there that 
we would like to take advantage of and have as part of the 
FirstNet network, and I think that kind of strong collaboration 
at the Federal, state, local, and tribal level is something 
that we've had a good start on and we look forward to building 
upon.
    Mr. Porter. And, Senator, I will be brief, but you 
mentioned rural. Rural coverage is obviously paramount for 
public safety and so we're committed to it. It's a foundational 
goal for FirstNet.
    We've mentioned that there are rigorous rural and non-rural 
build commitments and we are committed to meeting those. We are 
also to do that extensively working with rural broadband and 
rural wireless providers. In fact, Senator, in your state, 
we're working with SDN Communications and what that allows us 
to do is use those rural communities and their rural knowledge 
and their ability to build locally to help us build out that 
rural coverage that we so desperately need for public safety.
    So we're real excited about the progress we've made. We'll 
stay ahead of schedule and provide that critical connectivity.
    Senator Thune. Thank you.
    Senator Cantwell.

               STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for 
holding this hearing. It's so important to us in the Northwest, 
particularly in fire season, and all that we're doing.
    So I joined two letters, you know, to the Administration 
asking that Washington State be declared a disaster area for 
that and obviously get assistance. We have a Wildlife 
Management Technology Act, which is helping firefighters get 
access to mapping, GPS tools, and location of firefighters, 
which we think is a critical part of how we address this issue 
moving forward.
    The FirstNet nationwide wireless broadband network 
dedicated to the public safety is another aspect to that, and 
so we need to have effective communications. So FirstNet in 
2012 made progress in the deployment of, you know, an essential 
network to help with that.
    My question is I'm hoping that as we look at this moving 
forward, and part of it is just we always get into this 
situation where in disaster areas, not everybody has access, 
and then people don't--what's the right way to say this? States 
want to get their ducks in a row before they ask for the 
declaration because when they ask for the declaration, they 
don't have their ducks in a row, they feel like they'll get 
turned down.
    But in the meantime, a community's sitting there without 
great access trying to coordinate a disaster response. So we've 
been pushing for more clarity on that so that everybody just 
has all the broadband access that they need in coordination.
    So as I mentioned, fires are what we're dealing with. So, 
Mr. Parkinson and Mr. Porter, how has FirstNet been able to 
help during those disasters in providing, you know, 
communication in the current fire season, and what are you 
doing particularly with tribal areas because they're 
particularly on the short end of the stick when it comes to 
broadband capacity? Many of these are, you know, again the 
center point.
    Four years ago, one of our biggest fires, the Colville, had 
to just--I mean, they were their own response, and so we need 
to have good communication with them, as well.
    Mr. Porter. Yes. So I can start. Senator Cantwell, thank 
you.
    First of all, I want to just thank your state for being so 
progressive and such a leader in this area. I have regular 
communications with Chief Lombard. Chief Lombard has been a 
great fire leader out in your state and also, as you know, 
serves on FEMA and we have done innovative things collectively 
working together to put us closer together with his emergency 
operations centers and his planning so that we can be there.
    You mentioned the fires. We have a picture over here from 
Washington that is us hand-in-hand with FEMA at their 
operations center as well as the state EOC, emergency 
operations center, as they're working.
    So we're, you know, tightly integrated with your response 
team to the fires, but I will say it goes even far beyond this.
    We did deploy a SatCOLT in your state to help provide 
coverage for the fire response, but it's so much more than 
that. We actually have members of my team that are sleeping at 
base camps, at fire camps, to make sure that we understand the 
needs and are there to provide devices, to consult with 
equipment and the use of it.
    We've mentioned that we need multiple layers of support to 
help public safety. So you can see the SatCOLT and the 
deployable behind me, but there are also, as we mentioned, 
routers and switches that we need to be able to deploy to help 
these operations work and in the field give them hardened 
devices and capabilities to be able to withstand the fire.
    I also wanted to mention you talked about rural and tribal 
areas. Your state is one of the areas that we've been very 
focused on trying to build in those rural areas as well as the 
other states.
    We have put new sites on air in Lewis, Pacific, Grant, and 
Yakima Counties. We've also deployed Band 14 in Seattle, 
Tacoma, Spokane, Richland, Kennewick, Olympia, Bremerton, 
Yakima, Kittitas, and Whitman, and we're very excited about the 
new coverage that we put near Yakima Nation, and we've got 
several other sites that are prepared for tribal lands that 
we're working on access and ability to deploy.
    Senator Cantwell. So do you think that we're ready to 
integrate then with these other tools that we've given on 
fighting fires so that you can do firefighter location and 
system?
    Mr. Porter. Yes. In fact, right behind this picture was--I 
mentioned it earlier, but this is an application that is in our 
application ecosystem and this you can only do with a broadband 
network like FirstNet. You cannot do it with two-way radios.
    This is an application that fire is using today and what 
they do is they can see their own assets and people moving on 
the ground and then they can also see the fire as it moves on 
the ground and so they can use this to move their assets into 
the ideal location to make the most effect to put that fire 
under control and keep their people safe.
    Senator Cantwell. Well, Mr. Chairman, there's no amount of 
effort, I don't think, that we need to be doing here, given the 
increase in the fires, but in the Carleton Complex, this is how 
the Colville got left on their own, but then another two 
counties over, Pend Oreille, literally that county was left to 
their own.
    The resources that we have as the Federal Government and 
the state were all, you know, right in the center trying to 
deal with basically the Okanogan and various aspects of that.
    So then more fire starts for which now we're seeing, rapid 
fire starts. These people literally, the county citizenry, were 
left on their own, and guess what they were trying to do? 
Communicate to the whole county what people should do, but they 
didn't even have broadband. So literally these rural counties 
are left to fight these disasters on their own and the one 
thing--listen. I believe in our citizenry. They are--I'm, you 
know, working on legislation with my colleague, Cathy McMorris 
Rodgers in the House, and some of our Senate colleagues, to how 
do we, you know, empower them more to help us in these 
emergencies.
    But one of the things they need is broadband. So I hope we 
can continue this effort, and I hope we can get the network 
smart enough so that we really know where everybody's deployed 
in fighting the fires.
    So thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Cantwell.
    We have been joined by Senator Klobuchar.

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much, and thank you to 
you, as well, Senator Cantwell. I'm sorry. I was at another 
hearing and I just got here. In Judiciary, there are a few 
things going on there.
    As co-chair of the Senate Next Generation 9-1-1 Caucus with 
Senator Burr, our focus is ensuring safe and reliable 
communication networks for public safety professionals, and 
FirstNet, the only nationwide network dedicated to the public 
safety community, is critical to do that.
    Senator Cortez Masto and I have introduced the Next 
Generation 9-1-1 Act to create a Federal grant program to help 
state and local governments deploy Next Generation 9-1-1 
systems and just yesterday, Senator Burr and I introduced the 
Emergency Reporting Act to improve standards that require 
mobile carriers to report network outages to 9-1-1.
    And we have made, as you all know, progress with FirstNet. 
Our 9-1-1 systems yet are still in urgent need of upgrade.
    Do you agree that we need to upgrade our 9-1-1 system?
    Mr. Parkinson. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK.
    Mr. Porter. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Klobuchar. All right. And where are our virtual 
people? I think they're above somewhere.
    Ms. Holmes. I am here. This is Karima. Yes, ma'am, I do.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Mr. Porter is right here. OK. 
Captain Tony Harrison?
    Captain Harrison. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Very good. Ms. Holmes, do you agree 
that Next Generation 9-1-1 technology could complement our 
existing FirstNet infrastructure? Ms. Holmes?
    Ms. Holmes. I'm sorry. I have problems unmuting. Yes, I do. 
I think the systems are complementary.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Very good. And then to both of you, 
our virtual guests here, reliable 9-1-1 emergency 
communications are vital, especially during natural disasters.
    Ms. Holmes, do you believe legislation, like the one that 
we just introduced, would help ensure more reliable 
communication or reporting for public safety professionals 
during emergencies, wildfires, hurricanes, other natural 
disasters?
    Ms. Holmes. Yes, Senator, without a doubt. I was able to 
peruse your legislation and to be completely honest, I think it 
is in the mind and it is the words of every 9-1-1 leader in 
this country. I think that it's very important, if I may just 
add quickly, that one of the things that I try and stress and 
make sure is understood is that these are incidents that occur 
and usually our first responders are the citizens, the 
residents, the callers, and they don't have the cell phone 
number to the responder. They have 9-1-1. We have the cell 
phone number to the responder and so just as important as 
making sure that our responders are connected, we want to make 
sure that our callers are connected to our public safety 
answering points.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Thank you.
    I'm going to focus this on a Minnesota question here which 
would probably help with South Dakota, as well, because it's 
about bad weather.
    Minnesota has unique, we'll call it that, that's a nice 
euphemism, public safety needs given our weather conditions, 
including snowstorms and very, very cold weather, making 
communications between public safety professionals even more 
difficult.
    We'll have situations where people will be out on a 
snowmobile and get lost or run out of gas and have to 
communicate.
    Mr. Parkinson, can you provide an update on the progress of 
building out these networks to meet the public needs of states, 
particularly those with unique weather challenges?
    Mr. Parkinson. Thank you, ma'am. Indeed, Senator, one of 
the key things we have to think about when drafting the 
procurement, the RFP, back in 2015, was providing local 
solutions, local solutions to local problems, and the weather 
topic that you mentioned up in Minnesota is very different to 
the weather challenges that one has to face in Southern 
Florida, for example.
    We did think about that, and the data that we were able to 
capture from public safety back in 2015 and the ongoing 
interaction we had with public safety throughout the nation, 
not just in Minnesota but across the country, allows us to have 
insight into what those local needs are so that as the network 
is deployed and as, frankly, the technology evolves over time, 
we'll be able to offer solutions on the FirstNet system that 
are unique and that are tailored to local public safety.
    I think that's a key strength of the power of the network.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Very good. Thank you.
    Captain Harrison, what is your view on state and local 
coordination with FirstNet? Should there be more meetings? What 
additional measures should be taken to improve the 
communication with local officials and FirstNet?
    Captain Harrison. Thank you, Senator. I don't know if more 
meetings are necessarily what we need versus just having--I 
referenced this in my testimony--the ability for FirstNet to 
actually go forward with the building they want to do to 
actually get the end product out there.
    I've not been involved with the meetings at my level, but 
I'm involved In the result and that's what I know the citizens 
of our county and our officers and deputies are certainly the 
most interested in.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Very good. One last question.
    As we confront the coronavirus pandemic, we have to ensure 
that people suffering from mental health crises can easily 
access life-saving support and in March, I co-sponsored the 
National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, which would designate 
9-8-8 as the three-digit number for a national suicide 
prevention and mental health crisis hotline. The legislation 
passed the Senate in May.
    I guess I could ask this of Mr. Parkinson. Do you believe 
9-1-1 systems need to advance to coordinate efforts to respond 
to emergencies, particularly related to mental health, and do 
you believe 9-1-1 centers with advanced technologies have an 
advantage in helping individuals with mental health issues?
    Mr. Parkinson. Thank you for the question, ma'am.
    It's a little bit out of the wheelhouse in the work that 
we're doing with regards to FirstNet, but that being said, 
integration to provide solutions to every man and woman across 
the United States to ensure that they are safe is fundamental 
to the success of what we're trying to achieve at FirstNet.
    I think working with members across both parties and both 
chambers and across the nation, we've seen the need for 
FirstNet to answer local needs, as I mentioned before, and 
that's not just related to weather systems. That's not just 
related to how public safety responds, but it's taking into 
account disabilities. It's taking into account the hard-of-
hearing, for example, and all of that, I think, is necessary 
for us to look at and, to be honest, we're doing well, but, of 
course, we can do better, and I think that's something that we 
can continue to work perhaps with you and your staff on to 
ensure that we can integrate some of those solutions going 
forward.
    Senator Klobuchar. Ms. Holmes, do you just want to add 
anything on the mental health front with 9-1-1?
    Ms. Holmes. I do. I do want to add that about 15 years ago, 
for 8 years, I was a 9-1-1 call-taker, and I had taken multiple 
calls with suicidal callers or callers that are having mental 
health and that is a very hard call to take.
    So thank you, first of all, for establishing the three-
digit suicide hotline. That will definitely help us in 9-1-1, 
and then the question about mental health is huge. That's 
something that we're discussing here in the District, 
especially since COVID-19. We didn't see a spike in calls about 
mental health, and I think this ties back into Next Gen 9-1-1. 
The 9-1-1 centers can't carry the data that is needed.
    It will be great if we could have data or health reports 
about individuals with mental health that we could pass on to 
maybe not the responders but to mental health providers to 
respond and so those type of things, of course, is needed.
    We do need to talk. You know, 9-1-1 is an easy number to 
call, but we want to make sure that the infrastructure is 
updated and able to carry information like that.
    Mr. Porter. Senator, if I may, I just want to thank you for 
your passion to help mental health and really help those in 
need and, you know, the public safety area which is our focus 
here today with FirstNet, it struggles with mental health and 
with suicide rates, as well. They have high suicide rates.
    When I was in the Army, we were obviously dealing with PTSD 
and trying to recover from those things and so this is an 
example of where FirstNet is going far beyond the directive to 
provide coverage in these rural areas and applications and 
services.
    What we are doing at FirstNet, we've taken on the mission 
of partnering with public safety to help alleviate and try to 
give them the tools and capabilities to help remediate and 
minimize mental health and suicide within public safety, and 
we've brought on one of the experts in the field, a Ph.D., who 
came from the Army, who is now providing services to help with 
mental health within fire, police, EMS, doctors and nurses, and 
as you know in this pandemic, the doctors and nurses on the 
frontlines that are dealing with this pandemic will have 
ramifications of that for years.
    So equipping them with these capabilities is essential, we 
feel.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much, Mr. Porter.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.
    We have a vote on, 5 minutes left. This has been very 
helpful. Thank you to you gentlemen and to both of our remote 
panelists, Captain Harrison and Ms. Barnes, and very much 
appreciate.
    I would simply say, too, that we will keep the hearing 
record open for a couple of weeks and there are members who 
will probably want to submit questions for the record. We would 
ask that you all when you receive them, if you could respond to 
them as quickly as possible and then we'll be able to complete 
the hearing record.
    But this is a subject that we'll continue to pay attention 
to here and obviously we want to make sure that everything is 
moving forward as smoothly as can be possible, and we're 
grateful for the light that you all helped shed on how this is 
being implemented in rural areas of the country which many of 
us on this panel represent.
    So thank you for your time today, and with that, this 
hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:51 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

                            A P P E N D I X

    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Roger Wicker to 
                            Edward Parkinson
    Question 1. AT&T has completed eighty percent of its buildout of 
the FirstNet network. Yet, according to FirstNet's annual report to 
Congress, the network only provides coverage to forty-five percent of 
the rural population. How does FirstNet plan to complete the deployment 
of new towers in Mississippi?
    Answer. Deployment of the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband 
Network (NPSBN) to support communications in rural America remains a 
top priority for the FirstNet Authority. The program has worked closely 
with the Department of Commerce (the Department), including the 
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), to 
make rural broadband for public safety one of the Department's Annual 
Performance Goals (APG).
    To track rural deployment progress on the APG, the FirstNet 
Authority analyzes network deployment utilizing the Office of 
Management and Budget's definition of rural population using U.S. 
Census Bureau data. In September 2019, the FirstNet network covered 
approximately 45 percent of the rural population, or approximately 23 
million of the approximately 51 million people who constitute the 
Nation's rural population. By the end of March 2020, this coverage had 
increased by over 8 percent to cover almost 54 percent, or 
approximately 27.4 million people in rural areas. This growth in 
coverage surpasses the network deployment targets for the year as 
FirstNet continues the initial five-year network deployment, scheduled 
for completion in 2023.
    Regarding the specific buildout of the NPSBN in Mississippi, the 
FirstNet Authority's contractor, AT&T, is responsible for deploying, 
operating and maintaining the network in Mississippi, as detailed in 
its State Plan, including the siting of any new towers. To ensure this 
work continues and the deployment is completed as promised, the 
FirstNet Authority maintains rigorous network management and oversight 
to verify and validate AT&T's contractual obligations and ensure that 
public safety in Mississippi and all across the Nation have access to 
quality NPSBN services that meet their needs.

    Question 2. How is FirstNet making sure that its AT&T cellular 
towers are ``hardened'' to withstand natural disasters such as 
hurricanes and tornadoes?
    Answer. The FirstNet Authority learned early during consultation 
with public safety stakeholders that hardening and redundancy is a 
priority for public safety communications, along with extending the 
reach of coverage in rural areas and making portable network assets 
available upon request to augment network coverage and capacity. These 
needs were included in the request for proposal (RFP) and ultimately 
informed the FirstNet Authority's contract with AT&T to build, operate, 
and evolve the FirstNet network. As a result of this public-private 
partnership, the FirstNet Authority is delivering a robust and reliable 
network pursuant to the requirements in the contract with AT&T that 
were based upon guidance and input from public safety stakeholder 
organizations, including the National Public Safety Telecommunications 
Council (NPSTC), APCO International, and the FirstNet Authority's 
Public Safety Advisory Committee (PSAC), to name a few.
    In building out the NSPBN, the program has taken a multi-pronged 
approach to strengthen the network's physical resilience, recognizing 
there is no one-size-fits-all solution for every geography and every 
natural disaster. The FirstNet network is hardened though structural 
design; network, power and transport redundancy where possible; and the 
fleet of dedicated FirstNet deployable network assets. The NPSBN exists 
to equip first responders with a nationwide interoperable 
communications network and reliable, high-speed and dedicated 
connectivity when it is needed during emergencies and daily operations.
    In the event that a tower serving FirstNet users is damaged during 
a natural disaster or disrupted due to commercial power or transport 
outages, FirstNet-subscribed agencies have access to a dedicated fleet 
of portable network deployable assets, including: 72 Satellite Cells on 
Light Trucks (SatCOLTs), 3 Cells on Wings (Flying COWs), and other 
solutions such as FirstNet One, an aerostat (large blimp), to boost 
network coverage and capacity. These mobile cell sites link to FirstNet 
via satellite, do not rely on commercial power availability, and 
provide similar capabilities and connectivity as a cell tower.
    Before natural disasters with advanced warning, such as an 
approaching hurricane, deployable assets are pre-staged to promptly 
respond to potential requests for network support from FirstNet-
subscribed agencies. The deployment of these assets is led by the 
FirstNet Response Operations Group (ROG) that manages the FirstNet 
deployable program in alignment with the National Incident Management 
System and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National 
Response Framework to better guide the deployment of these assets. This 
Federal guidance helps to prioritize deployments based upon their 
situational awareness of life safety, incident stabilization, and 
property conservation.
    FirstNet ROG liaisons provide support to state emergency operations 
centers and the FEMA National Response Coordination Center during 
large-scale emergency events, which helps to enable effective alignment 
with local, state, tribal, and Federal first responders and inform the 
staging and deployment of the portable network assets. FirstNet-
subscribed agencies can request deployable assets through their 
FirstNet Solutions Consultant or by directly calling FirstNet Customer 
Care, which is staffed 24x7x365.
    In addition, to enable redundancy and improve performance 
nationwide, core network elements are geographically distributed across 
multiple locations.
    The public-private arrangement between the FirstNet Authority and 
AT&T is a 25-year commitment. As the program is only approximately two 
and a half years into the five-year initial deployment, one unique and 
exciting aspect about FirstNet is that public safety stakeholders will 
guide the future buildout, expansion, and evolution of the NPSBN. The 
FirstNet Authority has established a Roadmap to guide future 
investments and plans to continuously consult with first responder 
stakeholders. This will inform how the network evolves in the years to 
come to meet the unique needs and priorities of public safety.

    Question 3. In your testimony you highlight several instances where 
FirstNet has used deployable assets to augment coverage and capacity. 
Please list all 2020 requests for deployable assets to augment the 
coverage and capacity of the FirstNet network. Please include the 
corresponding entity that requested and used the deployable asset, 
where that entity is located, and the reason why the FirstNet network's 
coverage and capacity was not sufficient.
    Answer. The FirstNet Authority, in collaboration with the program's 
contracted partner, AT&T, offers agencies subscribed to FirstNet access 
to a dedicated fleet of portable network deployable assets, including: 
72 SatCOLTs, 3 Flying COWs, and other solutions such as FirstNet One, 
an aerostat (large blimp), to boost coverage during disasters or large 
planned events. These mobile cell sites link to FirstNet via satellite, 
do not rely on commercial power availability, provide similar 
capabilities and connectivity as a cell tower, and are available to 
public safety subscribers 24/7 at no extra cost.
    FirstNet deployables provide public safety users with dedicated 
coverage and capacity when public safety needs it, in a variety of 
situations, including during emergency operations in remote locations 
with limited connectivity, as well as when a disaster has impacted 
wireless towers, such as in a fire, tornado, hurricane, or other severe 
storm event. The ability to request support from the dedicated fleet of 
FirstNet deployable assets is a unique advantage for FirstNet users and 
makes sure first responders on FirstNet have the connectivity they 
need--when and where they need it.
    The FirstNet Authority has contracted with AT&T to provide the 
deployable network solution to FirstNet customers. In 2020, the program 
has actively supported public safety personnel so that they can remain 
connected as they responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, wildfires in the 
western United States, an active hurricane season in the Gulf of 
Mexico, and many other emergency and planned situations. Already this 
year, as of October 12, 2020, FirstNet users have submitted hundreds of 
requests for deployable assets, including 59 requests to provide 
connectivity to support wildfire response, more than 60 requests 
related to COVID-19 response operations, and 49 requests for network 
support following Hurricane Laura, 8 requests for Hurricane Sally, and 
2 requests for Hurricane Delta.
    While the FirstNet Authority cannot publicly share all of the 
customer requests for deployable assets because of the terms of the 
customer privacy agreements AT&T holds with FirstNet customers, below 
are some publicly released examples from agencies that have agreed to 
publicly share their experiences using the deployable program:

    Additionally, the FirstNet Authority would like to submit for the 
record a recent study released about the FirstNet deployable program by 
the Police Executive Research Forum. The study can be viewed here: 
https://www.policeforum.org/assets/FirstNetDeployables.pdf.

    Question 4. How many fire departments use FirstNet as their primary 
provider? How many law enforcement agencies use FirstNet as their 
primary provider? How many Federal agencies in the Department of 
Justice or Department of Homeland Security have adopted FirstNet as 
their primary provider?
    Answer. After contracting with AT&T in March 2017 and working with 
Governors and state public safety leadership in all U.S. states, 
territories, and the District of Columbia, FirstNet formally began 
offering service to public safety customers in March 2018. By the start 
of Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, there were approximately 9,000 public safety 
agencies and 750,000 device connections on the FirstNet network. By the 
end of FY 2020, there were more than 13,000 public safety agencies and 
1.5 million device connections on the network.
    FirstNet public safety users are now using the service throughout 
the country every day in their efforts to save lives. The FirstNet 
service, offered by AT&T, is a voluntary service to adopt, and it is up 
to the public safety entity or agency to decide to subscribe to the 
service. FirstNet subscribers are a diverse group of public safety 
entities across a variety of disciplines; and these connections include 
fire departments, law enforcement agencies, and Federal agencies such 
as those within the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department 
of Homeland Security.
    The number of entities, agencies and other FirstNet subscriber 
information is contract-sensitive trade secret proprietary information 
that the FirstNet Authority is not authorized to publicly disclose. We 
would be happy to meet with you and your staff to discuss this matter 
further.
                                 ______
                                 
     Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Rick Scott to 
                            Edward Parkinson
    Question 1. After Hurricane Michael devastated Florida's panhandle, 
our law enforcement lost communications due to the power and cell 
outages. And earlier this month, Hurricane Sally brought record 
flooding and rain to the Pensacola area, causing outages across the 
Panhandle.
    How has FirstNet enhanced telecommunication to ensure that, no 
matter the situation, our first responders and law enforcement stay 
connected?
    Answer. FirstNet users have access to dedicated Band 14 spectrum, 
with priority and preemption, to deliver fast and reliable connectivity 
for first responders and other public safety personnel. The FirstNet 
network provides public safety with its own ``fast lane'' so that users 
have wireless connectivity even if commercial networks are congested. 
When FirstNet-subscribed agencies need additional connectivity (for 
example, due to a natural disaster), they have access to a dedicated 
fleet of deployable network assets available on request at no cost to 
the agency. These assets are often pre-staged to areas just outside of 
where a hurricane is expected to land, to ensure that agencies have 
connectivity immediately following the storm.
    In the wake of recent storms, AT&T deployed its FirstNet-dedicated 
aerostat, FirstNet One, to provide coverage to particularly affected 
areas. As a resilient and dedicated network with priority and 
preemption and deployable resources at the ready, FirstNet provides 
enhanced communications capabilities to the Nation's public safety 
responders for every-day use and in emergency situations.

    Question 2. Have gaps in FirstNet been identified during the build 
out? How are they being addressed?
    Answer. The FirstNet Authority is required to consult with federal, 
state, tribal, and local public safety entities to ensure that the 
FirstNet network is designed to meet the needs of first responders 
across the country. Consultation is critical to the FirstNet 
Authority's work. Consultation informed the Request for Proposal that 
resulted in the 25-year contract to AT&T to build and maintain the 
network and was key in the development of customized State Plans 
outlining how the FirstNet network would be deployed over a five-year 
period in each state and territory. These State Plans were designed to 
meet the needs of first responders and other public safety personnel 
across the country. FirstNet coverage was planned with local 
practitioners and officials--and ultimately approved by governors--
because public safety knows what works for them. The FirstNet Authority 
will oversee continuous improvements, expansions, and upgrades to the 
network to ensure that it will adapt and evolve to meet the changing 
needs of public safety.

    Question 3. What is the pathway for our states with rural areas to 
receive the same quality FirstNet services?
    Answer. Deployment of the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband 
Network (NPSBN) to support communications in rural America remains a 
top priority for the FirstNet Authority. The program has worked closely 
with the Department of Commerce (the Department), including the 
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), to 
make rural broadband for public safety one of the Department's Annual 
Performance Goals (APG).
    To track rural deployment progress on the APG, the FirstNet 
Authority analyzes network deployment completion utilizing the Office 
of Management and Budget's definition of rural population using U.S. 
Census Bureau data. In September 2019, the FirstNet network covered 
approximately 45 percent of the rural population, or approximately 23 
million of the approximately 51 million people who constitute the 
Nation's rural population. By the end of March 2020, this coverage had 
increased by over 8 percent to cover almost 54 percent, or 
approximately 27.4 million people in rural areas. This growth in 
coverage surpasses the network deployment targets for the year as 
FirstNet continues the initial five-year network deployment scheduled 
for completion in 2023.
    The FirstNet Authority is responsible for verifying AT&T's delivery 
of the NPSBN, including in rural areas, to ensure Florida's public 
safety community receives the enhanced communications capabilities 
promised in Florida's State Plan. To ensure this work continues and the 
deployment is completed, the FirstNet Authority maintains strong 
network management and oversight to validate AT&T's contractual 
obligations and ensure that public safety is receiving quality NPSBN 
services that meet their needs.

    Question 4. What is FirstNet and AT&T doing to ensure that the 
network and technology are secure and protected from our adversaries or 
bad actors?
    Answer. Congress was clear in Middle Class Tax Relief and Job 
Creation Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-96) that securing the FirstNet network 
from cyber threats was fundamental to the successful implementation of 
the NPSBN. End-to-end cybersecurity is critical to the network and its 
users. In partnering with AT&T, the FirstNet Authority is capitalizing 
on years of planning and experience to create the secure environment 
that first responders expect. The FirstNet Authority and AT&T have 
worked closely with respect to the design for the FirstNet network's 
cyber solution and the overall security of the network. Among the key 
components of the enhanced cybersecurity of the NPSBN design is the 
nationwide dedicated core network AT&T is implementing. Rather than 
simply treating public safety as another customer, FirstNet subscribers 
are handled by a separate core, ensuring higher levels of reliability, 
redundancy, and protection through the dedicated processing of its 
network traffic.
    Another essential enhancement is AT&T's dedicated Security 
Operations Center (SOC) that monitors, detects, and mitigates threats 
in cybersecurity for the NPSBN. The SOC provides 24/7/365 coverage and 
support for all cybersecurity considerations and is backed up by the 
full global network visibility of AT&T to ensure proactive security for 
public safety.
    The cybersecurity team is also working cross-functionally to ensure 
that future users understand FirstNet's cyber solution and have trust 
in the tools used on the FirstNet network. Fundamental to these efforts 
is objective oversight of the cybersecurity solution for the NPSBN. 
This oversight includes an independent verification and validation of 
the solution's compliance with the objectives set forth in the FirstNet 
Authority's contract with AT&T. This ongoing process will be extensive 
and dynamic, and will include specific reporting, real-time access to 
incident tracking, onsite meetings, and other avenues as the system 
evolves.

  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Marsha Blackburn to 
                            Edward Parkinson
Interoperability
    Question 1. FirstNet was created to provide a single platform for 
first responders to communicate to address the challenges they 
confronted during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Hurricane Katrina and 
other emergency events.
    How has FirstNet improved interoperability across public safety 
agencies and jurisdictions?
    Answer. Through a successful effort by the FirstNet Authority that 
culminated in individualized network deployment plans for every state 
and territory, all states and territories decided to opt-in to the 
FirstNet network. As a result, the FirstNet Authority has established a 
single, interoperable nationwide network, as required by Congress, 
which ensures that users from different jurisdictions, agencies, and 
across levels of government have seamless interoperable communications. 
By utilizing one contiguous band of spectrum, Band 14, and operating on 
a single, dedicated nationwide core network, FirstNet has overcome the 
interoperability challenges and risks incumbent in a network comprised 
of patchwork systems.
    FirstNet is also inherently interoperable with other networks. Per 
the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-96) 
requirements, the FirstNet network solution is based upon open 
commercial standards such as 3GPP--the same standards that apply to 
commercial LTE networks. Additionally, the FirstNet network connects to 
the public Internet and Public Switched Telephone Network. 
Consequently, public safety subscriber communications between FirstNet 
and other networks interconnect in the same manner as is the current 
practice between commercial carriers, including calls, texts, and 
multimedia messages to any other wireless user on any other network. 
The FirstNet App Catalog also offers innovative solutions that allow 
interoperability between traditional Land-Mobile Radios (LMRs) and 
FirstNet smartphones and devices.
    Any first responder data that flows through FirstNet receives 
priority as it transits the network. There is nothing that a public 
safety user has to do to allow for its data to be prioritized--it is 
simply inherent to the network. In addition to their data being 
processed on a priority basis, primary users (e.g., law enforcement, 
fire service, EMS) are designated such that they have the ability to 
preempt others to ensure access to the system even in cases of 
emergencies and congestion. As far as connectivity to non-FirstNet 
users, all users can call, text, message with any other commercial/
landline network worldwide just like normal cellular today.
Network Performance
    Question 2. I understand there has been some issues with devices 
operating on FirstNet's signal strength as compared to devices 
operating on commercial networks.
    What steps has FirstNet taken, or expects to take, to ensure that 
the coverage meets its required objectives, including a signal strength 
required to provide acceptable network performance for its users' 
needs?
    Answer. Network performance and signal strength are critical to 
first responder user needs, especially in comparison to traditional 
commercial networks. To address those needs there are a number of steps 
the FirstNet Authority is taking, such as improving coverage over the 
life of the contract with AT&T and offering enhanced technology, such 
as High-Power User Equipment (HPUE) that will improve signal strength 
and network performance.
    The FirstNet Authority is responsible for ensuring that its 
contractor, AT&T, deploys, operates, and maintains the Nationwide 
Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN) for 25 years. Part of this 
responsibility includes validating that the coverage deployed in 
Tennessee and across the United States meet the required objectives, 
including signal strength, and that the network provides acceptable 
performance for the Nation's first responders.
    The initial deployment plan for the NPSBN commenced in 2018 and the 
network's wireless coverage continues to expand on a regular basis as 
AT&T progresses towards completing the nationwide network build. 
Additionally, FirstNet users have access to not only Band 14 (the 
FirstNet Authority's licensed spectrum) but all of AT&T's LTE spectrum 
bands and the company's entire coverage footprint.
    To ensure performance, AT&T is regularly conducting field tests and 
the FirstNet Authority lab team conducts similar tests in a lab setting 
that demonstrates the signal strength threshold for Band 14 is 
sufficient to satisfy the throughput required by public safety. The 
FirstNet Authority is also responsible for ensuring AT&T delivers 
enhanced communications capabilities such as push-to-talk and video 
connectivity, among other solutions. As the network build continues 
over the next several years, additional capabilities are becoming 
available such as HPUE devices that will further extend the range and 
improve the experience of public safety users. These devices have a 
longer range than traditional radios.
Communication Apps
    Question 3. Communication Apps on the FirstNet App Catalogue are 
paramount to keeping our first responders safe, aware, and informed of 
any given situation.
    I know some of these apps use considerable bandwidth while in use. 
Can you please site examples or specific apps that extend the reach of 
radio users with LTE interoperability and improve the capabilities of 
radio with multi-media data and video exchanges?
    Answer. Mission Critical Push-to-Talk (MCPTT) is a set of standards 
established by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to address 
some of the most specific needs of first responders for their LTE-based 
communications. When realized, mission critical services are not just a 
feature within the network but rather represent an entire ecosystem 
encompassing the applications, devices, and services that leverage the 
network. One of the FirstNet Authority's Roadmap priorities is to 
operationalize this concept, striving for consistency of experience and 
ease of adoption throughout the mission critical services suite of 
capabilities.
    The FirstNet Authority shares what it learns from public safety 
engagements with AT&T as a collaborative effort to improve the network 
and its services for public safety. The FirstNet Authority actively 
engages with AT&T in early beta trials of new products, and shares 
feedback and lessons learned to help hone those products more 
specifically toward first responder needs.
    The FirstNet Authority followed this process to support AT&T as 
they developed FirstNet Push-to-Talk (FirstNet PTT), the first 
nationwide, mission-critical standards-based service of its kind ever 
released in the United States. This product focuses on augmenting Land 
Mobile Radio (LMR), giving responders additional ways to expand their 
communication capabilities.
    The FirstNet PTT Release 1.0 delivered initial foundational 
capabilities for public safety including: one-to-one calling, group 
calling, ability to declare an emergency and preempt other PTT calls, 
text messaging to groups or individuals, and mutual aid capabilities. 
Release 1.0 was followed shortly by release 1.5 that introduced a 
downloadable application that could be installed on Android devices 
such as the Samsung S9 and S10. The FirstNet Authority continues to 
support the development of future upgrades that will expand offerings 
and boost the ecosystem of devices able to support these applications.
    Interoperability with existing LMR systems is key to making 
FirstNet PTT complement an agency's existing communication plans. LMR 
to FirstNet PTT via Radio over Internet Protocol (ROIP) interfaces will 
be available for talk-group interoperability between FirstNet PTT users 
and LMR users this fall. The more sophisticated interfaces that deal 
with the demands of larger systems and larger numbers of talk-groups 
are scheduled for a future release.
    Many agencies throughout the country are using FirstNet certified 
devices, which are certified by the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology's (NIST) Communications Technology Laboratory, to 
disseminate video to responders in the field, something they simply 
could not achieve on narrowband LMR devices. A preponderance of 
Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) solution providers are now offering a 
mobile version of their field applications so that first responders can 
continue to receive and transmit data about the calls they are 
responding to--whether on foot, on a bike, or in a vehicle. These data-
intensive applications can include photo and video attachments in 
addition to other information. These features have been widely 
requested by responders, as they enhance their ability to locate 
individuals in need and track how quickly back-up or mutual aid will 
arrive. Ultimately, these applications serve to improve responder 
safety, communications, and response times.
Spectrum
    Question 4. Public Safety and commercial partners are making 
immense investments in equipment to support FirstNet implementation.
    What oversight is FirstNet taking to ensure the long-term viability 
and use of these systems given the push to frequently change how the 
spectrum is used and the historic disablement of other devices that 
used it?
    Answer. The FirstNet Authority must be vigilant in its 
responsibility to be self-sustaining while also continuing to future-
proof the FirstNet network for public safety. One area that the 
FirstNet Authority has been focused on is the future investment into 
the FirstNet network. Earlier this year, the FirstNet Authority Board 
approved the first set of investments for enhancing the NPSBN. 
Specifically, the Board approved more than $200 million for initial 
network upgrades to set FirstNet on the path to 5G and to expand the 
dedicated fleet of deployable assets.
    Evolving the network to 5G is expected to be a multi-phase effort, 
beginning with upgrades to the dedicated FirstNet network core. The 
physically separate, highly available, redundant, and highly secure 
network core is foundational to FirstNet. This infrastructure acts as 
the nervous system of the network, separates all public safety traffic 
from non-public safety user traffic, and enables differentiated 
services for network users. In the future, 5G is expected to drive 
major increases in the quantity and types of connected devices for 
FirstNet users, including connected vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, 
and the Internet of Things.
    The FirstNet Authority's investments are made possible through a 
sustainable business model that enables the organization to continually 
improve and advance the network. The investments align with the 
FirstNet Authority's Roadmap, which outlines the key priorities and 
activities for advancing and evolving the network beyond current 
contractual commitments. In addition, the FirstNet Authority 
established a set of investment principles to further guide the 
decision-making process for network investment.
    Regarding devices, the FirstNet network currently supports a 
multitude of devices, over 200+ certified for use on FirstNet by NIST's 
Communications Technology Laboratory, which are based on international 
standards and support 3G to 5G. The FirstNet Authority will continue to 
ensure that flexibility, choice, and affordability characterize the 
device portfolio available to FirstNet subscribers.

 Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Richard Blumenthal to 
                            Edward Parkinson
    FirstNet plays a vital role ensuring public safety by enabling 
connectivity, especially in areas without reliable broadband. The 
COVID-19 pandemic underscores it importance. However, in conducting 
oversight of FirstNet, the Government Accountability Office (``GAO'') 
found local, state, and tribal stakeholders felt a lack of engagement 
by FirstNet and AT&T. The stakeholders described minimal contact and 
insufficient information from FirstNet and AT&T. At the hearing, you 
and Mr. Porter introduced firstnet.gov, explaining that public safety 
officials in each state could use this website to locate the name, 
phone number, and e-mail for the FirstNet point of contact in their 
state. While a start, this falls short of addressing the greater 
transparency and information sharing recommended by the GAO report. I 
seek additional information about FirstNet and AT&T's accountability to 
their stakeholders and any improvements made in light of the GAO 
report.

    Question 1. In accordance with GAO's recommendations, do you make 
the state-specific FirstNet commitments and metrics available to 
Congress and state officials?
    Answer. In accordance with the GAO's recommendation, the FirstNet 
Authority, in collaboration with AT&T, is strengthening its process by 
which the state-specific commitment reports are shared with the states 
and is developing a regular cadence and approach to sharing information 
with states and Congress that is consistent, reliable, and transparent. 
The FirstNet Authority anticipates completing this action by December 
2020.

    Question 2. On your recently launched website, firstnet.gov, you 
provide contact information for the FirstNet Authority representative 
in each state. Beyond the information listed, how are public safety 
officials able to contact and communicate with you?
    Answer. The FirstNet Authority encourages public safety officials 
to contact and communicate with the program in any way possible. 
Firstnet.gov is an excellent resource for public safety to connect with 
state and regional representatives via e-mail or phone with questions, 
feedback, or requests for information about the program. There is also 
a general e-mail box ([email protected]); phone number (571-665-6100); 
and mailing address (12201 Sunrise Valley Dr., Reston, VA 20192) that 
public safety officials can use to communicate with the FirstNet 
Authority. All of this information appears on the firstnet.gov website. 
Additionally, in an effort to continue to survey public safety feedback 
on the program, the FirstNet Authority has launched a public safety 
user survey tool at: https://www.firstnet.gov/public-safety/public-
safety-advocacy. Moreover, the FirstNet Authority's Public Safety 
Engagement team is dedicated to ongoing, pro-active engagement with 
Federal, tribal, state, and local stakeholders across the country to 
educate public safety about the program and solicit input to ensure the 
network continues to meet their needs.
    If individuals want to learn more about the FirstNet network 
service or how to subscribe, the FirstNet Authority directs them to 
FirstNet.com, which is the website managed by the Nationwide Public 
Safety Broadband Network contractor, AT&T. For billing, verification, 
and/or account assistance, FirstNet subscribers can call the FirstNet-
dedicated customer service number: 800-574-7000.

    Question 3. The GAO report recommended increased transparency and 
sharing of deployment and oversight information with stakeholders. What 
concrete steps have you taken towards implementing these changes?
    Answer. The FirstNet Authority is working collaboratively with AT&T 
to examine and identify oversight and monitoring information that can 
be shared with public safety stakeholders, consistent with adequate 
protection of program-sensitive and trade-secret information. The 
FirstNet Authority also plans to determine the best methods and 
appropriate frequency for the release of such oversight and monitoring 
information to stakeholders. Finally, the program is modifying the 
process and approach for sharing relevant portions of the state-
specific commitment reports with the states. These actions commenced 
earlier this year, and the FirstNet Authority anticipates completing 
them by December 2020.

    Question 4. Do you plan to take any further action to better 
communicate with and receive feedback from your stakeholders? If so, 
what is the plan? If not, please describe how and why your current 
communication methods are sufficient in addressing stakeholder 
concerns.
    Answer. The FirstNet Authority plans to continue to find new and 
better ways to communicate with and receive feedback from stakeholders. 
Guided by the FirstNet Authority's Strategic Plan, the program is 
enhancing its efforts to obtain feedback on public safety sentiment 
through surveys, targeted engagements, and contractually delivered 
data. Aligned with these efforts, the FirstNet Authority is analyzing 
new and existing data to identify public safety satisfaction indicators 
and measurements that align to and drive future engagements and 
contract oversight.
                                 ______
                                 
   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Kyrsten Sinema to 
                            Edward Parkinson
    Question 1. Throughout the country, first responders put their 
lives on the line to protect us, and reliable communications are 
critical to their response efforts. Wildfire season is always a 
difficult time for my state, and the current public health crisis 
further complicates fire season for Arizona families.
    I am pleased to hear many positive reports from Arizona public 
safety officials in our larger communities that have switched to 
FirstNet, such as in Phoenix, Mesa, and Flagstaff. But we need to 
continue these efforts to more rural areas of the state. I have spoken 
to Arizona first responders in rural areas that cannot utilize FirstNet 
services due to a lack of infrastructure.
    It is critical to have infrastructure in place so that firefighters 
and other first responders can ensure a swift initial response to 
contain fires. What is FirstNet doing to ensure first responders in 
rural areas have the accessible communications network necessary for 
their work, particularly in the following areas of Arizona: the 
southern border with Mexico; the Grand Canyon tourist area; the 
northwest portion of the state; and rural areas with a high likelihood 
of wildfires and other potential natural disasters.
    Answer. The FirstNet Authority agrees that it is critical to have 
infrastructure in place in Arizona so that first responders can 
communicate to perform their life-saving missions. When the FirstNet 
Authority engages and consults with public safety agencies in Arizona 
and across the United States, frequently the number one priority is the 
need for additional wireless coverage.
    The FirstNet Authority's contractor, AT&T, is responsible for the 
completion of Arizona's State Plan deployment, and the deployment of 
new towers in the state. This initial deployment commenced in 2018 and 
will continue through 2023. The FirstNet Authority is responsible for 
verifying AT&T's delivery of the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband 
Network (NPSBN), including in rural areas, to ensure Arizona's public 
safety community receives enhanced communications capabilities. To 
ensure this work continues and the deployment is completed, the 
FirstNet Authority maintains strong contract management and oversight 
to validate AT&T's contractual obligations and ensure that public 
safety is receiving quality NPSBN services.
    The public-private arrangement between the FirstNet Authority and 
AT&T is a 25-year commitment. As the program is only approximately two 
and a half years into the five-year initial deployment, one unique and 
exciting aspect about FirstNet is that public safety stakeholders will 
guide the future buildout, expansion, and evolution of the NPSBN. The 
FirstNet Authority has established a Roadmap to guide future network 
investments and plans to continuously consult with first responder 
stakeholders. This will inform how the network evolves in the years to 
come to meet the unique needs and priorities of public safety.

    Question 2. Tribal communities in Arizona have been 
disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus and face particular 
challenges for connectivity. Please describe your progress developing 
FirstNet infrastructure in tribal areas and your engagement and 
coordination with tribal communities on the development of FirstNet in 
tribal areas.
    Answer. The FirstNet Authority respects the nation-to-nation 
relationship that exists between Federally recognized Indian tribes and 
the United States government. In partnership with the Public Safety 
Advisory Committee's Tribal Working Group, the FirstNet Authority 
adopted a Tribal Consultation Policy to establish a foundation for 
honoring tribal sovereignty, accompanied by productive communications, 
consideration, and engagement with tribal governments surrounding the 
deployment of the NPSBN.
    The FirstNet Authority and its contractor, AT&T, have worked with 
several tribes to plan for and deploy infrastructure on tribal lands, 
such as the Cocopah, the Navajo, Tohono O'odam Nation, Pascua Yaqui, 
and White Mountain Apache. Additionally, deployable FirstNet 
infrastructure has supported public safety response in tribal 
communities. For example, FirstNet recently supported a response to 
COVID-19 on the Navajo Nation by providing several deployable assets to 
critical response locations in coordination with partnering Federal 
agencies.

    Question 3. How many deployable resources are stationed in the 
state of Arizona? Have you performed any analysis to determine if the 
number of deployable resources is sufficient to meet the needs of first 
responders during the busiest times, such as wildfire season?
    Answer. The FirstNet Authority, in partnership with its contractor, 
offers FirstNet-subscribed agencies access to a dedicated fleet of 
portable network deployable assets, including: 72 Satellite Cells on 
Light Trucks (SatCOLTs), 3 Cells on Wings (Flying COWs), and other 
solutions, such as FirstNet One, an aerostat (large blimp), to boost 
coverage during disasters or large planned events. These mobile cell 
sites link to FirstNet via satellite, do not rely on commercial power 
availability, provide similar capabilities and connectivity as a cell 
tower, and are available to public safety subscribers 24/7 at no extra 
cost.
    While the FirstNet Authority cannot publicly release where these 
deployable assets are located because that information is contract-
sensitive and proprietary, these dynamic FirstNet-dedicated assets can 
be deployed and staged anywhere across the country as circumstances 
warrant. During emergency situations or planned events where augmented 
coverage and capacity are required and following an established 
services request process, AT&T will then evaluate the request and 
provide the warranted FirstNet dedicated deployable services at no cost 
to public safety, within a 14-hour delivery window.
    FirstNet deployables provide public safety users with dedicated 
coverage and capacity when they need it, in a variety of situations, 
including during emergency operations in remote locations with limited 
connectivity, as well as when a disaster, such as a fire, tornado, 
hurricane, or other severe storm event, has impacted cell towers. The 
ability to request support from the dedicated fleet of FirstNet 
deployable assets is a unique advantage for FirstNet users and ensures 
first responders on the network have the connectivity they need--when 
and where they need it.
    The FirstNet Authority has contracted with AT&T to provide the 
deployable network solution to FirstNet customers. In 2020, the program 
has actively supported public safety personnel so that they are able to 
remain connected during responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, wildfires 
in the western U.S., an active hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico, 
and many other emergency and planned situations. As of October 12, 
2020, FirstNet users have submitted hundreds of requests for deployable 
assets, including 59 requests to provide connectivity to support 
wildfire response, more than 60 requests related to COVID-19 response 
operations, 49 requests for network support following Hurricane Laura, 
8 requests for Hurricane Sally, and 2 requests for Hurricane Delta.
    While the FirstNet Authority cannot publicly share all of the 
customer requests for deployable assets because of the terms of the 
customer privacy agreements AT&T holds with FirstNet customers, here 
are some publicly released examples from agencies that have agreed to 
publicly share their experiences using the deployable program:

    Additionally, the FirstNet Authority would like to submit for the 
record a recent study released about the FirstNet deployable program by 
the Police Executive Research Forum. The study can be viewed here: 
https://www.policeforum.org/assets/FirstNetDeployables.pdf.
    Finally, an internal analysis of the deployable program aided the 
FirstNet Authority in the decision to invest in more of these 
deployable assets in the future, so that the program may continue to 
support public safety when and where they need connectivity. Earlier 
this year, the FirstNet Authority Board approved the first set of 
investments for enhancing the NPSBN. Specifically, the Board approved 
more than $200 million for initial network upgrades to set FirstNet on 
the path to 5G and to expand the dedicated fleet of deployable assets.

    Question 4. In my outreach with Arizona first responders, some 
mentioned particular applications and capabilities which they are 
looking to deploy to advance their response efforts. Please describe 
FirstNet's progress on push to talk capabilities, and on connectivity 
to unmanned aircraft and helmet cams.
    Answer. Mission Critical Push-to-Talk (MCPTT) is a set of standards 
established by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to address 
some of the most specific needs of first responders for their LTE-based 
communications. When realized, mission critical services are not just a

safety, communications, and response times.
    Additionally, the FirstNet Authority has been engaging with 
agencies throughout the country to understand their utilization of 
unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and body/helmet worn camera video to 
enhance their operational response and increase situational awareness. 
In September 2020, the FirstNet Authority team spoke with 
representatives from the Chandler Arizona Police Department (Chandler 
PD) regarding UAS operations, how the data products are consumed, and 
how FirstNet can be used to transmit sensor video to those consumers. 
The region's FirstNet Authority Public Safety Advisor will continue to 
engage with the Chandler PD team as they develop their UAS data 
dissemination solution.

    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Jacky Rosen to 
                            Edward Parkinson
    DEPLOYMENT IN NEVADA: According to my state's Department of Public 
Safety, AT&T plans to build out about 30 cell sites in Nevada in the 
next 6 months.

    Question 1. Can you describe FirstNet's partnerships with rural and 
regional carriers to expand service to these communities?
    Answer. One of the FirstNet Authority's top priorities is expanding 
coverage for first responders where they need connectivity in rural 
areas across the country. As the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job 
Creation Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-96) specifically calls out, the network 
must be deployed in rural America, not just urban centers. The FirstNet 
Authority stimulated the speed of deployment in its contract with AT&T 
by encouraging rural carrier partnerships with service providers that 
had existing infrastructure that complemented AT&T's coverage 
footprint. This has allowed AT&T to expand the Nationwide Public Safety 
Broadband Network's (NPSBN) reach in parts of Nevada, and other regions 
of the country, more rapidly than by putting up brand new cell sites in 
those harder to reach rural and tribal areas.

    LOCAL, STATE, AND TRIBAL ENGAGEMENT: The January GAO report on 
FirstNet described comments from some local, state, and Tribal 
stakeholders about a perceived lack of engagement. These stakeholders 
claimed that they initially had extensive consultations with FirstNet, 
but later were not receiving much information or transparency on 
broadband deployment and FirstNet oversight. GAO made several 
recommendations to FirstNet on improving information-sharing and 
collaboration with shareholders.

    Question 2. Can you share how FirstNet has begun implementing these 
recommendations for local, state, and Tribal engagement?
    Answer. In accordance with the GAO's recommendation, the FirstNet 
Authority, in collaboration with AT&T, is strengthening its process by 
which the state-specific commitment reports are shared with the states 
and is developing a regular cadence and approach to sharing information 
with states that is consistent, reliable, and transparent. 
Additionally, the FirstNet Authority plans to continue to find new and 
better ways to communicate with and receive feedback from local, state, 
Federal, and tribal stakeholders. Guided by the FirstNet Authority's 
Strategic Plan, the FirstNet Authority is enhancing its efforts to 
obtain feedback on public safety sentiment through surveys, targeted 
engagements, and contractually delivered data. Aligned with these 
efforts, the FirstNet Authority is analyzing new and existing data to 
identify public safety satisfaction indicators and measurements that 
align to and drive our future engagements and contract oversight.

    Question 3. How does FirstNet partner with local communities, 
especially when selecting locations of new cell sites or other 
infrastructure?
    Answer. The FirstNet Authority is required to consult with Federal, 
state, tribal, and local public safety entities to ensure that the 
FirstNet network is designed to meet the needs of first responders 
across the country. Consultation is critical to the FirstNet 
Authority's work. Consultation informed the Request for Proposal that 
resulted in the 25-year contract to AT&T to build and maintain the 
network and was key in the development of customized State Plans 
outlining how the FirstNet network would be deployed over a five-year 
period in each state and territory. These State Plans were designed to 
meet the needs of first responders and other public safety personnel 
across the country. FirstNet coverage was planned with local 
practitioners and officials--and ultimately approved by governors--
because they know best what their first responders need. The FirstNet 
Authority will oversee continuous improvements, expansions, and 
upgrades to the network to ensure that it will adapt and evolve to meet 
the changing needs of public safety.
    The FirstNet Authority is aware that emergency responders' needs 
will change. To keep up to date, the FirstNet Authority employs a 
dedicated team whose mission is to engage with public safety 
nationwide, including in local communities, to learn what works, what 
does not, and how services can be improved. That feedback is 
instrumental in helping to shape the future of the network.

    Question 4. I know that the cost of upgrading equipment can be a 
barrier for our state and local agencies. Do you know of any available 
grant funding to help state and local agencies transition to FirstNet?
    Answer. The FirstNet Authority understands the budget constraints 
many public safety agencies must manage and that FirstNet, while 
voluntary, does come at a cost. The program's contractor, AT&T, has 
worked hard to control costs so that the network can be affordable for 
public safety agencies and is incentivized to do so through NPSBN 
contract. The FirstNet Authority also understands that state and local 
agencies often look to Federal grant programs for assistance. Federal 
financial assistance has long been a critical funding resource for 
public safety, and will help drive NPSBN user adoption by providing 
financial support to many first responders who subscribe to the 
network.
    Federal grants are a significant resource to support state, local, 
tribal and territorial emergency communications systems across the 
Nation and grant dollars fund emerging technology systems, training, 
equipment, and planning costs. Most recently, funding in the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES Act) provided 
some assistance for the procurement of devices and other information 
technology equipment. The FirstNet Authority engages with Federal, 
state, tribal, and local agencies in discussions around grant programs 
that these agencies have available to them.
    Although these programs are not administered by the FirstNet 
Authority, they include, but are not limited to: the Homeland Security 
Grant Program at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a number of 
grants at the U.S. Department of Justice such as the Edward Byrne 
Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program and the Tribal Access 
Program, and grant programs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The FirstNet Authority has also received feedback from users, such 
as the Indiana Integrated Public Safety Commission, that found FirstNet 
can cut costs across public safety departments. In the case of Indiana 
(see: https://firstnet.gov/newsroom/podcast/episode-29-indiana-
approach-lmr-lte-interoperability) use of FirstNet devices and an app 
that enables smartphones to communicate with traditional Land-Mobile 
Radios (LMRs) has meant that agencies are able replace certain radio 
equipment with low-cost smartphones.

    SOFTWARE APPLICATION CYBERSECURITY: Earlier this year, AT&T struck 
an agreement with Nellis Air Force Base to deploy its 5G services and 
deliver FirstNet to the base. This agreement provides the necessary 
coverage to the 9,500 military and civilian personnel and over 40,000 
members of our military population in the area, including families and 
retirees.
    I applaud and support the efforts made to bring the next generation 
of telecommunications and 9-1-1 first responder services to one of 
Nevada's crown jewels, but given the critical infrastructure at play, I 
also want to ensure that the cybersecurity policies and standards are 
top-notch and that the users of the network are not vulnerable.
    One specific aspect of cybersecurity I'm interested in is how the 
data shared over this network and application ecosystem is protected.

    Question 5. How is the First Responder Network Authority ensuring 
that the sensitive data, like exact location and other identifiable 
information, is not vulnerable to bad actors, especially when talking 
about software applications for the public safety market?
    Answer. Congress was clear in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job 
Creation Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-96) that securing the FirstNet network 
from cyber threats was fundamental to the successful implementation of 
the NPSBN. End-to-end cybersecurity is critical to the network and its 
users. In partnering with AT&T, the FirstNet Authority is capitalizing 
on years of planning and experience to create the secure environment 
that first responders expect. The FirstNet Authority and AT&T have 
worked closely with respect to the design for the FirstNet network's 
cyber solution and the overall security of the network. Among the key 
components of the enhanced cybersecurity of the NPSBN design is the 
nationwide dedicated core network AT&T has deployed. Rather than simply 
treating public safety as another customer, FirstNet subscribers are 
handled by a separate core, ensuring higher levels of reliability, 
redundancy, and protection through the dedicated processing of its 
network traffic.
    Another essential enhancement is AT&T's dedicated Security 
Operations Center (SOC) that monitors, detects, and mitigates 
vulnerabilities and threats that might impact the cybersecurity of the 
NPSBN. The SOC provides 24/7/365 coverage and support for all 
cybersecurity considerations and is backed up by the full global 
network visibility of AT&T to ensure proactive security for public 
safety.
    The cybersecurity team is also working cross-functionally to ensure 
that public safety users understand FirstNet's cyber solution and have 
trust in the tools used on the FirstNet network. Fundamental to these 
efforts is objective oversight of the cybersecurity solution for the 
NPSBN. This oversight includes an independent verification and 
validation of the solution's compliance with the objectives set forth 
in the FirstNet Authority's contract with AT&T. This ongoing process is 
extensive and dynamic, and will include specific reporting, real-time 
access to incident tracking, onsite meetings, and other avenues as the 
system evolves.

    Question 6. What processes are in place for vetting the software 
applications developed for that market?
    Answer. The FirstNet Authority takes cybersecurity and the security 
of applications that public safety uses on the network extremely 
seriously. Today, the FirstNet Applications Catalog (App Catalog) is 
available to FirstNet subscribers and identifies a range of vetted and 
reliable public safety focused applications. While first responders can 
use applications from any commercial store, the FirstNet App Catalog 
only includes those that have undergone a rigorous vetting and approval 
process.
    Any application in the App Catalog must meet public safety 
criteria, including security and data privacy conditions to be listed 
or certified. The software is reviewed and vetted to 1) verify the 
application is directly relevant to the needs of first responders, 2) 
be highly confident the software is secure and protects data, and 3) 
demonstrate a history of limited unplanned outages with three 9's (99.9 
percent) availability. Additionally, applications can become FirstNet 
CertifiedTM. These applications have demonstrated their 
ability to limit unplanned outages with four 9's (99.99 percent) 
availability and meet the additional criteria of resiliency, 
scalability, and optimized use of mobility resources.
    The FirstNet App Catalog is growing quickly ‒ 150 
applications are now included. Every addition to the FirstNet App 
Catalog means more ways for public safety to take advantage of the 
unique features of the FirstNet network. Each application in the 
catalog is identified with a primary activity it enables, making it 
easy for responders to identify the ones they may need.

    WILDFIRES: The ongoing wildfires in the West are devastating our 
communities, businesses, and our environment. They also pose a danger 
to our communications and critical infrastructure, making it harder for 
our first responders to respond. I know that FirstNet currently has 
over 70 deployable assets, and is helping to ensure that our 
firefighters and other first responders have connectivity and enhanced 
network coverage during the current wildfires, as well as other 
emergencies.

    Question 7. Can you describe FirstNet's plans to grow your fleet of 
deployables and how they can improve effectiveness for public safety 
operations?
    Answer. The FirstNet Authority, in collaboration with its 
contracted partner, AT&T, offers FirstNet subscribed agencies access to 
a dedicated fleet of portable network deployable assets including: 72 
Satellite Cells on Light Trucks (SatCOLTs), 3 Cells on Wings (Flying 
COWs) and other solutions, such as FirstNet One, an aerostat (large 
blimp) to boost coverage during disasters or large planned events and 
are available to public safety subscribers 24/7 at no extra cost. These 
mobile cell sites link to FirstNet via satellite, do not rely on 
commercial power availability, and provide similar capabilities and 
connectivity as a cell tower.
    FirstNet deployables provide public safety users with dedicated 
coverage and capacity when they need it, in a variety of situations, 
including during emergency operations in remote locations with limited 
connectivity, as well as when a disaster, such as a fire, tornado, 
hurricane or other severe storm event, has impacted cell towers. The 
ability to request support from the dedicated fleet of FirstNet 
deployable assets is a unique advantage for FirstNet users and ensures 
first responders on the network have the connectivity they need--when 
and where they need it.
    The FirstNet Authority has contracted with AT&T to provide the 
deployable network solution to FirstNet customers. In 2020, the program 
has actively supported public safety personnel so that they are able to 
remain connected during responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, wildfires 
in the western United States, an active hurricane season in the Gulf of 
Mexico, and many other emergency and planned situations. As of October 
12, 2020, FirstNet users have submitted hundreds of requests for 
deployable assets, including 59 requests to provide connectivity to 
support wildfire response, more than 60 requests related to COVID-19 
response operations, 49 requests for network support following 
Hurricane Laura, 8 requests for Hurricane Sally, and 2 requests for 
Hurricane Delta.
    Below are some examples of public safety's use of the deployable 
program:

    Additionally, the FirstNet Authority would like to submit for the 
record a recent study released about the FirstNet deployable program by 
the Police Executive Research Forum. The study can be viewed at: 
https://www.policeforum.org/assets/FirstNetDeployables.pdf.
    Finally, an internal analysis aided the FirstNet Authority's 
decision to invest in more of these deployable assets, so that the 
network can continue to support public safety when and where they need 
connectivity. Earlier this year, the FirstNet Authority Board approved 
the first set of investments for enhancing the NPSBN. Specifically, the 
Board approved more than $200 million for initial network upgrades to 
set FirstNet on the path to 5G and to expand the dedicated fleet of 
deployable assets.

    Question 8. How do FirstNet and AT&T work with our public land 
management agencies--such as Forest Service or Bureau of Land 
Management--during wildfires and other disasters?
    Answer. AT&T's FirstNet Response Operations Group Program operates 
in alignment with the National Incident Management System and the 
Incident Command System, developed by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. This approach helps FirstNet coordinate with a multitude of 
agencies across various levels of government and prioritize deployments 
based on a number of situational awareness factors. It also facilitates 
the efficient deployment of mobile assets for requesting FirstNet-
subscriber agencies during critical incidents, such as wildfires.
    The FirstNet Authority, through its Public Safety Engagement team, 
has educated Federal agencies on the use and integration of public 
safety broadband data during planned and unplanned events. The FirstNet 
Authority and AT&T have been working closely with the U.S. Department 
of the Interior (DOI) Office of Wildland Fire over the past two years 
in planning and execution of a proof-of-concept to bring broadband onto 
the fireground during complex wildland fires. Select Incident 
Management Teams are utilizing the FirstNet solution and equipment 
packages to determine performance characteristics and processes through 
the 2020 fire season in order to determine practicality for a wider 
distribution and implementation in the future. The U.S. Forest Service 
and other DOI bureaus, such as the Bureau of Land Management, have been 
involved in this proof-of-concept effort as part of the overall 
interagency approach to battling wildfires.

    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Roger Wicker to 
                              Jason Porter
    Question 1. How is AT&T ensuring that its cellular towers are 
sufficiently ``hardened'' to withstand natural disasters such as 
tornadoes and hurricanes in Mississippi?
    Answer. Whether it is an owner or a lessee of a macro cell tower, 
AT&T confirms that every tower in Mississippi on which network 
facilities are attached has undergone structural analysis to ensure 
that it has been built to the Telecommunications Industry Association 
Standards and International Building Code. Additionally, there are 
annual inspections to affirm compliance with these standards. Similar 
analyses are conducted before modifications or attachments to towers 
are made.
    AT&T has placed fixed generators at 80 percent of new site build 
locations in the state to guard against loss of commercial power, and 
further ensures a minimum of four hours of battery backup power at 
locations without a fixed generator. The sites in Mississippi with 
battery backup are also covered by the company's national generator 
overlay plan that provisions generators at existing mobility locations 
when they are needed. All generators are exercised on a monthly basis 
to ensure they will run in the event of a commercial power loss, and 
AT&T completes preventive maintenance on each location twice per year. 
Where AT&T has entered into shared generator agreements with other 
tower owners, AT&T has service level agreements in place to ensure that 
the generator will be in working condition 24/7/365.
    In hurricane and tornado-prone areas like Mississippi, AT&T has 
taken extra hardening steps such as installing back-up and permanent 
generators at critical cell sites and switching facilities, locating 
critical equipment in less vulnerable areas, and protecting against 
flooding by elevating critical equipment in flood-prone areas. AT&T 
supports FirstNet users in Mississippi with its FirstNet Response 
Operations Group (ROG), which serves as public safety's direct partner 
for their connectivity needs, whenever they need it. This group, 
established in 2018, is staffed by a team of former first responders 
and helps manage the FirstNet-dedicated fleet of deployable assets, 
such as the mobile cell sites that link to FirstNet via satellite and 
do not rely on commercial power availability.
    Examples of recent FirstNet deployable responses in Mississippi 
include:

   A FirstNet SatCOLT boosted connectivity for first responders 
        at a response center in Soso, MS following an EF4 tornado in 
        April, 2020.

   A FirstNet deployable asset supported the annual PATRIOT 
        South 2020 emergency response training at the Bobby L. Chain 
        Airport in Hattiesburg, MS and Camp Shelby in March, 2020.

   A FirstNet SatCOLT boosted connectivity for first responders 
        at Keesler Air Force Base during the ``Thunder Over the Sound'' 
        airshow in Biloxi, MS in May, 2019.

    In addition to these specific initiatives, AT&T has over 120 years 
of complex network management and recovery experience and leads one of 
one of the Nation's largest and most advanced network disaster recovery 
programs. These resources can be brought to bear on any contingency 
that may occur in Mississippi. Since 1992, AT&T has invested more than 
$650 million in its domestic world-class Network Disaster Recovery 
(NDR) Team and equipment, which is dedicated to recovering AT&T voice 
and data service in areas affected by a disaster. The NDR solution 
combines network infrastructure and support trailers, recovery 
engineering software applications and a response team with both full-
time and volunteer AT&T team members. This team, including Disaster 
Recovery First or ``DRF'' responders, have spent more than 145,000 
working hours on field exercises and deployments in training for all 
types of situations. We practice our disaster response plans several 
times each year in anticipation of events, both foreseen and 
unforeseen.
    The AT&T Business Continuity Team (BCT) has extensive experience in 
planning for and responding to a wide variety of situations that can 
affect the AT&T network. The BCT plans are designed to get the network 
back to a Business as Usual (BAU) state as quickly and safely as 
possible. The BCT planning process is predicated on continuous 
improvement: it includes incorporating improvement opportunities from 
previous events into future response activities, as no two natural 
disasters are ever exactly like. The BCT publishes the Business 
Continuity Preparedness Handbook, https://www.att.com/Common/about_us/
pdf/business_continuity_handbook.pdf (last accessed Oct. 22, 2020), 
and, as part of its Business Continuity Management mission, administers 
the Telecommunications Service Priority, Wireless Priority Service and 
Government Emergency Telecommunications Service programs for AT&T.
    Finally, the AT&T Global Technology Operations Center (GTOC) 3P 
(Preventive, Predictive, Pro-Active) Process collects, identifies, and 
evaluates the consolidated view of any high-risk network 
vulnerabilities that occur in a particular area in order to determine 
if there is a need to develop a mitigation network response plan. The 
GTOC Service Continuity Compute & Storage organization establishes 
safeguards to minimize the risk, cost, and duration of disruption to 
essential business processes. The work of the GTOC is essential to all 
AT&T up-front prevention and mitigation efforts, as well as to 
comprehensive emergency response and recovery plans.

    Question 2. When does AT&T estimate that all new towers that were 
committed to be built in Mississippi's FirstNet State Plan will be 
completed?
    Answer. AT&T has five years, until 2023, to build out coverage as 
agreed by Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant, the Federal government, and 
AT&T in the FirstNet State Plan for Mississippi. For the next 20-plus 
years, continuous improvements, expansions, and upgrades will be made 
and the network in Mississippi will adapt and evolve to meet changing 
needs. AT&T is on target to meet or exceed its contractual obligations 
to the FirstNet Authority with respect to the completion of 
Mississippi's FirstNet State Plan deployment, including the deployment 
of new towers. Under the state plan deployment there are a number of 
new, purpose-built FirstNet tower sites coming to Mississippi, and Band 
14 has been added to existing sites. New, purpose-built FirstNet tower 
sites are on-air in Lucedale, George County and in Leakesville, Greene 
County, near the De Soto National Forest while Band 14 has been 
deployed in the Mississippi Cellular Market Areas of Jackson, Benton, 
Biloxi-Gulfport, Lamar, Tunica, Leake, Smith, Pascagoula, Washington, 
Bolivar, Yalobusha, and Copiah.
    The specific FirstNet buildout information presented to each state, 
including Mississippi, is confidential for both security and 
competitive reasons. We would be happy to provide additional specific 
information to your office in a private setting.

    Question 3. What is the percentage of the rural geographical 
coverage in Mississippi by AT&T FirstNet's Band 14 network?
    Answer. FirstNet is built for all first responders, including 
career or volunteer; federal, tribal, state or local; urban, suburban 
or rural. That is why reaching rural and remote parts of America is one 
of our top priorities. Over 1,000 new, purpose-built FirstNet sites are 
currently planned as part of the initial nationwide FirstNet network 
expansion. Most of these sites are in rural areas. Thus far we have 
launched over 250 of these sites across the country--including areas in 
Mississippi such as outlined above.
    There are strict rural and non-rural coverage targets that must be 
met at every phase of the initial five-year buildout of the FirstNet 
Band 14 spectrum. Now in year three of the buildout, AT&T remains ahead 
of schedule on the nationwide deployment, reaching over 80 percent of 
the contracted nationwide Band 14 build in both non-rural and rural 
areas. AT&T is on track to meet its state deployment plan in 
Mississippi, where FirstNet adoption has been strong in both rural and 
urban areas. There are now thousands of FirstNet users from across 
public safety disciplines, including AAA Ambulance Service in 
Hattiesburg, MS that serves 16 counties in southern Mississippi. The 
24-hour emergency and non-emergency medical transport service is using 
FirstNet to share life-saving information with dispatch, EMS units, 
hospitals and other medical providers in rural areas, which often face 
communications challenges. The FirstNet Authority prepared a use case 
video featuring AAA Ambulance Service. In August 2018, Acadian 
Ambulance also announced its use of FirstNet. Acadian Ambulance 
provides services to communities in Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana. 
We would be happy to meet with your office to provide additional 
details.
    The specific FirstNet Band 14 coverage information for each state, 
including Mississippi, is confidential for both security and 
competitive reasons. We would be happy to provide additional details to 
your office in a private setting.
                                 ______
                                 
     Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Rick Scott to 
                              Jason Porter
    Question 1. What is the pathway for our states with rural areas to 
receive the same quality FirstNet services?
    Answer. The pathway for each state was established in coordination 
with each state in the context of their individual custom deployment 
plans, in which States were able to identify where they had coverage 
priorities. These priorities in turn informed the placement of the new 
FirstNet tower sites. Over 1,000 new, purpose-built FirstNet sites are 
currently planned as part of the initial nationwide FirstNet network 
expansion. Most of these sites are in rural areas. Thus far we have 
launched over 250 of these sites across the country--including areas in 
Florida.
    New, purpose-built FirstNet tower sites are now on-air in Florida, 
including in the following counties: Orange, Lake, Citrus, Gulf, 
Suwanee, Lee, Putnam, Glades, Osceola, Saint Johns, Marion, Flagler, 
Sumter, Nassau, Hendry, Brevard, Bradford, Alachua, and Hernando. And 
more new towers are on the way. Band 14 has been deployed in the 
following Cellular Market Areas in Florida: Miami, Tampa, Orlando, 
Jacksonville, W. Palm Beach, Citrus, Fort Myers, Lakeland, Melbourne, 
Daytona Beach, Pensacola, Fort Pierce, Sarasota, Collier, Bradenton, 
Tallahassee, Ocala, Glades, Gainesville, Hardee, Fort Walton Beach, 
Putnam, Panama City, Walton, Hamilton, Dixie, Monroe, Jefferson, and 
Calhoun.
    AT&T prepares regular updates regarding the FirstNet Band 14 and 
new site deployment progress in each state to keep state stakeholders 
apprised of the FirstNet buildout. Additionally, rural and non-rural 
areas alike receive the same quality FirstNet services, and the entire 
first responder ecosystem, including health care workers on the 
pandemic frontlines, have access to competitively priced FirstNet 
services.
    Congress baked this collaborative process into FirstNet's enabling 
legislation, which required the FirstNet Authority to consult with 
federal, state, tribal, and local public safety entities to ensure that 
the FirstNet network was designed to meet the needs of first responders 
across the country. Since 2012, multi-stakeholder consultation has 
informed every action taken by the FirstNet Authority, including its 
original Request for Proposal (RFP) and subsequent contract award to 
AT&T to build and maintain the network.
    Indeed, the FirstNet Authority set milestones for rural and 
nonrural coverage in the RFP that the private-sector partner would have 
to meet. In addition, AT&T, in its role as the private-sector partner 
under the contract, is collaborating with rural wireless network 
providers across the country to help build out additional LTE coverage 
and extend FirstNet's reach in rural and tribal communities. In 
addition, AT&T has also worked with rural broadband providers to 
provide the fiber transport for some of the new FirstNet tower sites.
    The specific FirstNet buildout information presented to each state, 
including Florida, is confidential for both security and competitive 
reasons. We would be happy to provide additional specific information 
to your office in a private setting.

    Question 2. What are FirstNet and AT&T doing to ensure that the 
network and technology is secure and protected from our adversaries or 
bad actors?
    Answer. Congress's mandate to establish a single and secure 
nationwide public safety interoperable broadband network is fulfilled 
through FirstNet's encrypted physically separate core, and in this key 
respect is differentiated from every other commercial wireless network. 
The highly available, redundant, physically separate, dedicated core 
was designed to comply with many standard security regulations and 
needs, and it will continue to evolve to take advantage of new 
technologies and address emerging requirements. FirstNet is designed 
with end-to-end encryption tools to support public safety users 
transmitting encrypted data securely across Long-Term Evolution (LTE)-
enabled devices.
    No other major commercial wireless provider submitted bids during 
the FirstNet RFP process, indicating that other carriers were not 
willing, or did not see a business case, in building a new network to 
public safety's requirements, including stringent security 
requirements, that would also subject them to the Federal government's 
scrutiny and accountability. The FirstNet solution--a single, highly 
secure and interoperable network with a single, common, highly secure 
core as required by Congress--addresses the security risks that would 
otherwise be introduced in an alternative network architecture in which 
multiple networks controlled by a multitude of carriers create 
additional security risks, additional points of failure, and multiple 
opportunities for service degradation.
    Integral to FirstNet's secure capabilities is a dedicated Security 
Operations Center (SOC) and security engineering organization, both 
staffed by dedicated FirstNet security experts at AT&T. The SOC 
monitors and manages FirstNet traffic 24x7 and employs many of the 
security systems and procedures that AT&T has honed over decades of 
operating its highly secure global networks. The FirstNet security 
engineering unit focuses solely on the security needs of FirstNet but 
collaborates closely with the thousands of other engineers working 
throughout AT&T.
    FirstNet also offers a highly secure app ecosystem, including the 
FirstNet App Catalog that features mobile apps particularly valuable to 
public safety, such as apps related to situational awareness and apps 
particularly useful for EMS. These apps, most of which are provided by 
third-party app providers, are examined for security, reliability and 
relevance to public safety according to standards set by the FirstNet 
Authority before they are listed in the FirstNet App Catalog. These 
standards go well beyond the basic security reviews required for apps

  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Marsha Blackburn to 
                              Jason Porter
Interoperability
    Question 1. Mr. Porter: FirstNet was created to provide a single 
platform for first responders to communicate to address the challenges 
they confronted during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Hurricane Katrina 
and other emergency events.
    How has FirstNet improved interoperability across public safety 
agencies and jurisdictions?
    Answer. The events of September 11, 2001 showcased a lack of 
interoperability across public safety agencies and jurisdictions, and 
spurred Congress to work to establish FirstNet to address this 
fundamental issue. FirstNet implements Congress's vision to the issues 
exposed by 9/11 by delivering interoperability across all public safety 
agencies and jurisdictions on the network, meaning that they can 
communicate seamlessly with each other using a common, highly secure 
network platform that avoids the congestion that impacts commercial 
networks in times of emergency.
    The current pandemic has showcased this value. In New York City, 
for example, FirstNet equipped hundreds of ambulances, EMS and other 
first responders with a common, interoperable communications platform 
and dedicated connectivity when needed to help them coordinate the 
transport of patients between hospitals and health systems across the 
state. Coordinating with New York public safety agencies, government 
officials, and city hospitals, the FirstNet team at AT&T provided a 
cross-agency solution to marshal hundreds of ambulances that came into 
the city from outside the region to provide mutual aid.
    Apart from the pandemic, in early March, tornadoes tore a 60-mile 
path through West and Middle Tennessee, devastating many communities 
including those in Putnam County, where first responders within the 
Emergency Operations Center (EOC) turned to FirstNet to provide the 
critical communications necessary to do their jobs. As Brandon Smith, 
Putnam County's EOC manager explained, ``we knew we had damaged cell 
networks almost immediately. . . Our immediate priority became to 
create a network for first responders to communicate. Having a single 
network, with Uplift capabilities and deployable assets tailored to our 
needs, was an essential part of our plan and is why we quickly reached 
out to FirstNet.'' https://southregion.att.com/firstnet-americas-
public-safety-communications-platform-provided-vital-support-in-
aftermath-of-march-tornadoes-in-putnam-county/
    Within hours, FirstNet deployed dedicated portable network assets, 
including Satellite Cells on Light Trucks (SatCOLTs) to Putnam County. 
SatCOLTs are heavy-duty mobile cell sites that link to FirstNet via 
satellite and do not rely on commercial power availability. They 
provide first responders with similar capabilities and connectivity as 
a cell tower. In total, the FirstNet Team at AT&T and the AT&T Network 
Disaster Recovery Team deployed eight assets across Putnam County in 
the days following the tornadoes to serve both first responders and 
residents. These deployed resources reinforced communications 
capabilities and allowed first responders from multiple organizations 
to more efficiently and effectively coordinate their efforts over 
FirstNet's fully interoperable platform.
    In addition, the land mobile radio (LMR) network tower--which is 
public safety's traditional two-way radio system--serving Cookeville 
and the surrounding area was damaged by the storm. In the storm's 
immediate aftermath and the days that followed, FirstNet served as the 
primary line of communications for first responders supporting search 
and rescue and recovery efforts.
    Finally, when the President of the United States arrived in 
Tennessee to tour the devastation, a local first responder agency 
requested a FirstNet dedicated deployable asset to aid their 
communication and further enable interoperable coordination across the 
federal, state and local agencies on duty during the presidential 
visit.
Network Performance
    Question 2. Mr. Porter: I understand there has been some issues 
with devices operating on FirstNet's signal strength as compared to 
devices operating on commercial networks.
    What steps has FirstNet taken, or expects to take, to ensure that 
the coverage meets its required objectives, including a signal strength 
required to provide acceptable network performance for its users' 
needs?
    Answer. As noted in a recent study by the Police Executive Research 
Forum (PERF), ``signal strength is not the only measure--or even the 
most important measure--for evaluating LTE networks for public 
safety.'' In the key takeaways section of PERF's study, they note that 
the ability to move data, text, photos and videos quickly and reliably 
is critical. PERF's evaluation during everyday drive tests and two 
large-scale demonstrations on the National Mall found that FirstNet had 
faster data download and upload speeds and greater performance and 
reliability than major commercial networks, even in locations where 
FirstNet exhibited weaker signal strength. See more detailed 
information in the report at the following website--https://
www.policeforum.org/assets/FirstNetCaseStudy.pdf
    Additionally, there are strict nationwide rural and non-rural 
coverage targets that must be met at every phase of the initial five-
year buildout of the FirstNet Band 14 spectrum, and AT&T is meeting 
those targets. In Tennessee, new, purpose-built FirstNet tower sites 
are now on-air in Macon, Jackson, Pickett, Macon, Bledsoe, Overton, 
Rutherford, Claiborne, Fentress, Hancock, Warren, Polk, and Grundy 
counties, with more new towers on the way. Band 14 has been deployed in 
the Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Fayette, Giles, and Maury cellular 
markets.
    In addition, FirstNet offers first responders a robust ecosystem of 
devices and mobile applications, including solutions to help public 
safety agencies further enhance reliability, such as with mobile 
routers, modems, and the Rapid Deployment Kit (RDK). The RDK solution 
provides a 300-foot connected wi-fi bubble via LTE or satellite to 
support mobile command posts and emergency incidents in rural and 
remote locations. AT&T has witnessed great responsiveness from device 
manufacturers in connection with rolling out Band 14 capable devices 
that convey the power and capabilities of the FirstNet network to 
subscribers.
Communication Apps
    Question 3. Mr. Porter: Communication Apps on the FirstNet App 
Catalogue are paramount to keeping our first responders safe, aware, 
and informed of any given situation.
    I know some of these apps use considerable bandwidth while in use. 
Can you please cite examples or specific apps that extend the reach of 
radio users with LTE interoperability and improve the capabilities of 
radio with multi-media data and video exchanges?
    Answer. Prior to FirstNet, public safety encountered difficulty 
when trying to communicate across agencies due to lack of interoperable 
communications between existing land mobile radio (LMR) systems. And 
when a significant public safety crisis occurred, heavy public use 
often caused traditional wireless communications networks to become 
congested, making it difficult for first responders to communicate on 
those networks.
    Public safety communication is rapidly changing, and FirstNet and 
LTE-enabled technology are the future. We can expect to see as much 
progress over the next 60 months as what has occurred over the last 60 
years. LTE-enabled technology offers distinct benefits. LMR networks 
have not traditionally supported apps, video and multimedia, but 
FirstNet does. FirstNet is driving innovation with push-to-talk 
solutions over LTE that are built to mission critical standards. 
Additionally, LMR-to-LTE interoperability enables state, tribal and 
local governments to extend the reach of their existing radio system.
    As part of our commitment to public safety and the FirstNet 
Authority, we have built FirstNet Push to Talk based on the public 
safety standards set by the Third Generation Partnership Project 
(3GPP). This is the body responsible for LTE and 5G global standards. 
In addition to voice services, FirstNet PTT's rich, future capabilities 
gives first responders access to the timely and relevant information 
they need for enhanced situational awareness. With FirstNet PTT, public 
safety users have the highest priority on the network \1\, enabling 
dependable, high performance group communications. FirstNet PTT is 
built right into the core of the FirstNet network. With PTT servers in 
six data centers across the country, calls are routed through the 
nearest node to provide lower latency and faster access. Engineered to 
the key performance indicators defined by the global standard, FirstNet 
PTT delivers low latency and high availability, resulting in superior 
calling performance.

Spectrum
    Question 4. Mr. Porter: Public Safety and commercial partners are 
making immense investments in equipment to support FirstNet 
implementation.
    What oversight is FirstNet taking to ensure the long-term viability 
and use of these systems given the push to frequently change how the 
spectrum is used and the historic disablement of other devices that 
used it?
    Answer. AT&T has witnessed great responsiveness from device 
manufacturers in connection with rolling out Band 14 capable devices 
that will fully convey the power and capabilities of the FirstNet 
network to subscribers. Unlike the proprietary, closed architecture 
platforms and closed device ecosystems with limited advanced 
capabilities that have long characterized legacy public safety 
operational solutions, FirstNet is built upon open standards, including 
3GPP international wireless standards. FirstNet is driving innovation 
through a robust device and mobile application ecosystem that is 
lowering costs, increasing choice and boosting capabilities for first 
responders, affording far greater flexibility and affordability than 
legacy solutions.
    AT&T made a commitment to the FirstNet Authority to offer a robust 
solutions ecosystem for public safety that will continue to evolve over 
the life of the contract to meet public safety's needs. FirstNet offers 
innovative device options that enable first responders to tap into the 
power of FirstNet. As part of our commitment with the FirstNet 
Authority, we are working closely with device manufacturers to deliver 
next generation technologies to public safety. And so far, we've kept 
that commitment, working with the device community to include Band 14 
in new offerings. There are now more than 180 FirstNet 
ReadyTM devices available to FirstNet users.
    AT&T also committed to the FirstNet Authority to launch, and then 
to continue to improve and evolve throughout the life of the contract, 
a dedicated applications ecosystem that consists of a FirstNet 
Applications Catalog featuring applications specific to public safety, 
as well as an applications developer program. In 2017, AT&T launched 
the FirstNet App Catalog and Developer Program dedicated to America's 
first responders. The catalog now identifies more than 150 highly 
secure apps tested for public safety that can help agencies enhance 
their situational awareness and other capabilities.
    While competition, constant network evolution and regular 
advancements to the device ecosystem have been characteristics of the 
flourishing commercial wireless marketplace in America, AT&T has made 
efforts to address this dynamic in the context of the first responder 
community through such innovative offerings as the Free Smartphones for 
Life initiative launched at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under 
this initiative, FirstNet subscribed public safety agencies can get 
premium FirstNet ReadyTM smartphone devices for free for 
their agency-paid users. This offer helps agencies equip their first 
responders with the latest technology and cost effectively connect them 
to critical communications when and where they need it most and ensures 
that they are able to upgrade their devices every two years at no cost, 
keeping them up to date with the latest technology at no charge. The 
Free Smartphones for Life offer is available to agencies that commit to 
a new FirstNet Mobile--Unlimited for Smartphone line of service or 
eligible upgrade with either a 2-year service agreement or a new AT&T 
Installment 30-month agreement, among other conditions.
                                 ______
                                 
 Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Richard Blumenthal to 
                              Jason Porter
    Richard Blumenthal: FirstNet plays a vital role ensuring public 
safety by enabling connectivity, especially in areas without reliable 
broadband. The COVID-19 pandemic underscores it importance. However, in 
conducting oversight of FirstNet, the Government Accountability Office 
(``GAO'') found local, state, and tribal stakeholders felt a lack of 
engagement by FirstNet and AT&T. The stakeholders described minimal 
contact and insufficient information from FirstNet and AT&T. At the 
hearing, you and Mr. Parkinson introduced firstnet.gov, explaining that 
public safety officials in each state could use this website to locate 
the name, phone number, and e-mail for the FirstNet point of contact in 
their state. While a start, this falls short of addressing the greater 
transparency and information sharing recommended by the GAO report. I 
seek additional information about FirstNet and AT&T's accountability to 
their stakeholders and any improvements made in light of the GAO 
report.

    Question 1. In accordance with GAO's recommendations, do you make 
the state-specific FirstNet commitments and metrics available to 
Congress and state officials?
    Answer. While the GAO recommendation was directed to the FirstNet 
Authority, AT&T, in its role as private sector partner to the FirstNet 
Authority, prepares periodic state-level status updates, as it is 
contractually required to do. AT&T maintains a FirstNet lead for every 
state who has the job of interacting with state, local officials and 
public safety leaders. The FirstNet Team at AT&T is available to meet 
with state leaders to provide them with an update on the progress of 
the deployment of Band 14 and new FirstNet purpose-built tower sites in 
their state. We are also happy to provide updates to Congress upon 
request as necessary. The specific FirstNet buildout information for 
each state is confidential for both security and competitive reasons.

    Question 2. On your recently launched website, firstnet.gov, you 
provide contact information for the FirstNet Authority representative 
in each state. Beyond the information listed, how are public safety 
officials able to contact and communicate with you?
    Answer. The firstnet.gov site is operated by the FirstNet 
Authority, which provides the contact information for a public safety 
advocate for each region of the country. Separately, AT&T, in its role 
as private sector partner to the FirstNet Authority, has assigned a 
FirstNet Solutions Consultant for every state who is available to 
support any FirstNet subscriber, whether public safety, health care, or 
any other type of eligible Primary or Extended Primary FirstNet User. 
Eligible FirstNet users may visit the ``FirstNet Built with AT&T'' 
website at http://www.firstnet.com to request outreach by a FirstNet 
Solutions Consultant.

    Question 3. The GAO report recommended increased transparency and 
sharing of deployment and oversight information with stakeholders. What 
concrete steps have you taken towards implementing these changes?
    Answer. This recommendation was made to the FirstNet Authority, 
which has accepted GAO's recommendations relating to ways to further 
enhance its contract oversight and stakeholder outreach processes, and 
AT&T looks forward to working with FirstNet Authority to implement 
those recommendations. In addition, as noted above, AT&T prepares 
regular state-level status updates, as it is contractually required to, 
on the progress of the deployment of Band 14 and new FirstNet purpose-
built tower sites in their state. AT&T further solicits direct and 
indirect feedback from first responder stakeholders, and we appreciate 
the value of performance studies, like the one released by the Police 
Executive Research Forum.

    Question 4. Do you plan to take any further action to better 
communicate with and receive feedback from your stakeholders? If so, 
what is the plan? If not, please describe how and why your current 
communication methods are sufficient in addressing stakeholder 
concerns.
    Answer. FirstNet Authority, as noted above, intends to implement 
the GAO recommendations with respect to transparency and keeping state 
stakeholders apprised of the progress to meet the buildout commitments. 
AT&T, as FirstNet Authority's private sector partner, looks forward to 
working with FirstNet Authority to implement those recommendations. In 
addition, as also noted above, AT&T is preparing regular state-level 
status updates on the progress of the deployment of Band 14 and new 
FirstNet purpose-built tower sites in each state. AT&T maintains a 
FirstNet lead for every state who has the job of interacting with 
state, local officials and public safety leaders. AT&T further solicits 
direct and indirect feedback from first responder stakeholders, and we 
appreciate the value of performance studies, like the one released by 
the Police Executive Research Forum. We are also happy to provide 
updates to Congress upon request.

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Kyrsten Sinema to 
                              Jason Porter
    Question 1. Throughout the country, first responders put their 
lives on the line to protect us, and reliable communications are 
critical to their response efforts. Wildfire season is always a 
difficult time for my state, and the current public health crisis 
further complicates fire season for Arizona families.
    I am pleased to hear many positive reports from Arizona public 
safety officials in our larger communities that have switched to 
FirstNet, such as in Phoenix, Mesa, and Flagstaff. But we need to 
continue these efforts to more rural areas of the state. I have spoken 
to Arizona first responders in rural areas that cannot utilize FirstNet 
services due to a lack of infrastructure.
    It is critical to have infrastructure in place so that firefighters 
and other first responders can ensure a swift initial response to 
contain fires. What is FirstNet doing to ensure first responders in 
rural areas have the accessible communications network necessary for 
their work, particularly in the following areas of Arizona: the 
southern border with Mexico; the Grand Canyon tourist area; the 
northwest portion of the state; and rural areas with a high likelihood 
of wildfires and other potential natural disasters.
    Answer. FirstNet is built for all first responders, including 
career or volunteer; federal, tribal, state or local; urban, suburban 
or rural. That is why reaching rural and remote parts of America, 
including in Arizona, is one of AT&T's top priorities as FirstNet's 
contractor. We are also collaborating with rural wireless network 
providers across the country to help build out additional LTE coverage 
and extend FirstNet's reach in rural and tribal communities, including 
in Arizona.
    There are strict nationwide rural coverage targets that must be met 
at every phase of the initial five-year buildout of the FirstNet Band 
14 spectrum, and AT&T is meeting those targets. New, purpose-built 
FirstNet tower sites are already on air in Yavapai and Pima counties, 
and more towers are on the way. The State of Arizona identified 
coverage along the state's southern border and around the Grand Canyon, 
as well as on tribal lands, in rural regions and in and around state 
prisons as priority coverage areas, which informed the development of 
the FirstNet State Plan for Arizona.
    FirstNet adoption has been strong in Arizona, including within the 
State's largest cities and counties and in the rural and tribal areas. 
There are thousands of FirstNet users from across public safety 
disciplines on FirstNet in Arizona, including the Mesa Police 
Department and the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military 
Affairs.
    Some examples of the value that the FirstNet Response Operations 
Group and the dedicated fleet of FirstNet portable network assets have 
brought to some of the areas you outline in your question are:

   A FirstNet Satellite Cell on Light Truck (SatCOLT) boosted 
        connectivity for tribal first responders at the Navajo Nation 
        Fair in September, 2019.

   A FirstNet SatCOLT augmented connectivity for public safety 
        at the Granite Mountain Hotshots Memorial event in Yarnell, AZ 
        in February, 2019.

   In October, 2019, a FirstNet deployable asset was sent to 
        provide connectivity in Pima County after communication was 
        disrupted due to infrastructure damage at a tower site.

   A FirstNet deployable was staged and available on standby 
        while firefighters battled a wildland fire near Page, AZ in 
        2019.

    The specific details on the progress of the FirstNet buildout 
available to state leaders in each state, including Arizona, is 
confidential for both security and competitive reasons. We would be 
happy to further discuss this question with your office in a private 
setting.

    Question 2. Tribal communities in Arizona have been 
disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus and face particular 
challenges for connectivity. Please describe your progress developing 
FirstNet infrastructure in tribal areas and your engagement and 
coordination with tribal communities on the development of FirstNet in 
tribal areas.
    Answer. Tribal lands represent a large portion of the land-base for 
the entire state and include diverse geographies, including canyons, 
mountains, large desert areas and underpopulated regions where 
communication is challenging. As noted, FirstNet's reach in rural and 
tribal communities in Arizona is being extended by AT&T through its 
deployment of wireless infrastructure and through its collaboration 
with rural wireless network providers to help build out additional LTE 
coverage.
    FirstNet enables unique solutions to address the communications 
needs in rural and remote locations. For instance, two FirstNet 
SatCOLTs provided connectivity for Navajo Nation first responders and 
FEMA personnel in response to the COVID-19 outbreak on the reservation 
in Window Rock, AZ and Tse Bonito, NM. Further examples of deployable 
assets sent to rural and tribal lands are outlined in our response to 
your first question.
    We are proud that Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez publicly 
expressed his gratitude to AT&T for a recent contribution to the Navajo 
Nation COVID-19 Relief Fund and the support for FirstNet users during 
the public health crisis by noting, ``AT&T has developed a strong 
partnership with the Navajo Nation over the years by working together 
to implement FirstNet to help our Nation's first responders, and now 
with their generous donation that will benefit our frontline warriors 
and our Navajo people.'' https://southwestregion.att.com/att-supports-
navajo-nation-covid-19-response

    Question 3. How many deployable resources are stationed in the 
state of Arizona? Have you performed any analysis to determine if the 
number of deployable resources is sufficient to meet the needs of first 
responders during the busiest times, such as wildfire season?
    Answer. Examples of such resources deployed to Arizona are provided 
above. In terms of planning and analysis, AT&T leads one of the 
Nation's largest and most advanced network disaster recovery programs. 
AT&T is the first company nationwide to receive the United States 
Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Private Sector Preparedness 
Program (PS-Prep) certification. AT&T supports FirstNet users with its 
FirstNet Response Operations Group (ROG), which serves as public 
safety's direct partner for their connectivity needs, whenever they 
need it. This group, established in 2018, is staffed by a team of 
former first responders and helps to manage the FirstNet-dedicated 
fleet of deployable assets, such as our mobile cell sites that link to 
FirstNet via satellite and do not rely on commercial power 
availability. There are dedicated AT&T personnel in Arizona providing 
support and coordination with state and local first responder 
organizations.
    The FirstNet deployable fleet has 72 FirstNet Satellite Cell on 
Light Trucks (SatCOLTs) that are stationed nationwide, three Flying 
cells on wings (Flying COWs), and an aerostat blimp designed for use 
following large-scale, catastrophic events. In addition to deploying 
new permanent infrastructure, the dedicated fleet of FirstNet portable 
network assets is available 24/7 to FirstNet subscribed agencies at no 
charge to them. The FirstNet deployable assets provide first responders 
connectivity when and where they need it--both during large planned 
events and during times of emergency. The portable network assets link 
to FirstNet via satellite and do not rely on commercial power 
availability.
    These dynamic assets can be deployed and staged anywhere across the 
country as circumstances warrant. During emergency situations or 
planned events where augmented coverage and capacity are required, 
FirstNet and AT&T will evaluate the request, and when warranted, AT&T 
will provide the deployable services at no cost within a 14-hour 
delivery window.

    Question 4. In my outreach with Arizona first responders, some 
mentioned applications and capabilities which they are looking to 
deploy to advance their response efforts. Please describe FirstNet's 
progress on push to talk capabilities, and on connectivity to unmanned 
aircraft and helmet cams.
    Answer. As part of our commitment to public safety and the FirstNet 
Authority, we have built FirstNet Push to Talk based on the public 
safety standards set by the Third Generation Partnership Project 
(3GPP). This is the body responsible for LTE and 5G global standards. 
In addition to voice services, FirstNet PTT's rich, future capabilities 
gives first responders access to the timely and relevant information 
they need for enhanced situational awareness. With FirstNet PTT, public 
safety users have the highest priority on the network,\1\ enabling 
dependable, high performance group communications. FirstNet PTT is 
built right into the core of the FirstNet network. With PTT servers in 
six data centers across the country, calls are routed through the 
nearest node to provide lower latency and faster access. Engineered to 
the key performance indicators defined by the global standard, FirstNet 
PTT delivers low latency and high availability, resulting in superior 
calling performance.

    \1\ Preempts all traffic other than mandated emergency calling.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    FirstNet PTT offers users an opportunity where both the device and 
the network are working hand in hand to constantly improve the user PTT 
experience. For these and other reasons, public safety has recognized 
the value of FirstNet PTT as a complement and supplement to their 
existing LMR solution.
    With respect to connectivity to unmanned aircraft, at the 
Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta in New Mexico, public safety 
agencies employed a drone detection system to monitor restricted 
airspace above the event and surrounding areas. FirstNet provided the 
critical connection needed to support the system as well as on-the-
ground operations. This is illustrative of the kind of connectivity to 
unmanned aircraft that FirstNet can provide. And FirstNet capabilities 
can be harnessed and are being harnessed for use with body cams and 
other solutions, including mobile apps from FirstNet's highly secure 
app ecosystem.

                              Jason Porter
    DEPLOYMENT IN NEVADA: According to my state's Department of Public 
Safety, AT&T plans to build out about 30 cell sites in Nevada in the 
next 6 months.
    Question 1. Do you have an idea of how soon those towers can be 
used to bring connectivity to rural areas? And how will this help the 
overall broadband connectivity in the state of Nevada?
    Answer. AT&T has five years, until 2023, to build out the FirstNet 
Band 14 coverage as agreed to by the Nevada Governor, the Federal 
government, and AT&T in the FirstNet State Plan for Nevada. For the 
next 20-plus years, continuous improvements, expansions, and upgrades 
will be made and the FirstNet network in Nevada will adapt and evolve 
to meet changing needs. AT&T is on target to meet or exceed its 
contractual obligations to the FirstNet Authority with respect to the 
completion of Nevada's FirstNet State Plan deployment, including the 
deployment of new, purpose-built FirstNet towers and collaboration with 
rural wireless providers to extend the reach of LTE coverage. As a 
result of the FirstNet Band 14 buildout, new tower sites are now on air 
in Reno and Storey counties and more are on their way. In addition, 
Band 14 has been deployed in the Las Vegas and Storey cellular markets.
    Examples of FirstNet Response Operations Group (ROG) deployable 
responses in Nevada include:

   Four deployable assets were deployed to boost connectivity 
        for public safety communication and coordination during the 
        Area 51 event in Alamo, Crystal Springs, Hiko, and Amargosa 
        Valley, NV in September, 2019. The FirstNet ROG had several 
        members of its team on the ground to support public safety at 
        the event.

   A FirstNet satellite cell on light truck (SatCOLT) augmented 
        connectivity for first responders at Burning Man in Gerlach, NV 
        in August, 2019.

   In December, 2019, a FirstNet SatCOLT supported the command 
        center in preparation for and during the city's New Year's Eve 
        celebration in Las Vegas, NV.

   A FirstNet deployable asset augmented connectivity for first 
        responders on FirstNet during an event at the Las Vegas 
        Speedway in May, 2019.

   A FirstNet deployable asset supported firefighters and 
        provided connectivity at the command camp in response to the 
        Goshute Cave Fire near Ely, NV in September, 2018.

    In response to the quality FirstNet performance and the unique 
support that is provided to first responders on FirstNet--ensuring they 
have connectivity when and where they need it--FirstNet adoption is 
progressing in rural, urban and tribal areas in Nevada. There are 
thousands of FirstNet users from across public safety disciplines in 
Nevada, including the Las Vegas Fire Department. The specific FirstNet 
buildout information available to state leaders in each state, 
including Nevada, is confidential for both security and competitive 
reasons. We would be happy to further discuss this question with your 
office in a private setting.
    As new FirstNet towers are built in the state and Band 14 spectrum 
is deployed, including in rural areas, commercial cellular coverage and 
speeds on AT&T's wireless network will improve as well because AT&T's 
commercial spectrum bands will be added to the FirstNet towers and 
deployed at the same time as Band 14 spectrum.

    LOCAL, STATE, AND TRIBAL ENGAGEMENT: The January GAO report on 
FirstNet described comments from some local, state, and Tribal 
stakeholders about a perceived lack of engagement. These stakeholders 
claimed that they initially had extensive consultations with FirstNet, 
but later were not receiving much information or transparency on 
broadband deployment and FirstNet oversight. GAO made several 
recommendations to FirstNet on improving information-sharing and 
collaboration with shareholders.
    Question 2. I know that the cost of upgrading equipment can be a 
barrier for our state and local agencies. Do you know of any available 
grant funding to help state and local agencies transition to FirstNet?
    Answer. There are a host of grant funding programs available to 
state, tribal and local agencies that can provide additional resources 
to help agencies expand their use of FirstNet, including the U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security's State, Tribal and Urban Area Homeland 
Security Grant Program and other grant programs available through the 
U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Health and Human Services, and other 
Federal agencies. And there is an opportunity for the Federal 
government to recalibrate some of these grant programs, so that they 
can better help state, tribal and local agencies transition to 
FirstNet.
    Across the country, state, local and tribal governments are at a 
crossroads and considering how best to support the communications needs 
of their first responders, while planning and budgeting to maintain 
aging legacy systems and looking to implement the advanced, LTE-enabled 
communications solutions that ride upon FirstNet. As decision makers 
look to modernize their jurisdictions' radio networks and other legacy 
systems, as well as improve redundancy, reliability and extend the 
reach of these systems, FirstNet can help to reduce both upfront costs 
and the recurring costs related to maintenance, operation and upgrades. 
FirstNet enables state, tribal and local government agencies to begin 
shifting from a capital expenditure (CapEx) model to an operating 
expense (OPEX) model. This means they subscribe for service, instead of 
bearing the enormous financial responsibility of building and 
maintaining a network. In addition, FirstNet's mobile device ecosystem 
provides a suitable and cost-effective alternative to costly two-way 
radios.
    However, many of the existing grant programs are oriented to CapEx 
grants, rather than OPEX funding. These grant programs were originally 
developed to help defray the high CapEx costs associated with legacy 
communications systems, such as LMR and customer premise equipment 
(CPE) technology, but many do not support the monthly recurring costs 
commonly associated with subscribing to a wireless network, such as 
FirstNet. Even with the assistance of CapEx oriented grants, 
proprietary, closed architecture platforms can result in higher costs 
for the state, tribal and local jurisdictions to bear with fewer 
advanced capabilities for first responders. In comparison, FirstNet is 
built upon open standards, including 3GPP international wireless 
standards. FirstNet is driving innovation through a robust device and 
application ecosystem that is lowering costs, increasing choice and 
boosting capabilities for first responders.
    Finally, AT&T is doing its part to ensure that first responders 
have the equipment to do their jobs using their dedicated Nationwide 
Public Safety Broadband Network, FirstNet. AT&T has made efforts to 
address this dynamic in the context of the first responder community 
through such innovative offerings as the Free Smartphones for Life 
initiative launched at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under this 
initiative, FirstNet-subscribed public safety agencies can get premium 
FirstNet ReadyTM smartphone devices for free for their 
agency-paid users. This offer helps agencies equip their first 
responders with the latest technology and cost effectively connect them 
to critical communications when and where they need it most and ensures 
that they are able to upgrade their devices every 2 years at no cost, 
keeping them up to date with the latest technology at no charge. The 
Free Smartphones for Life offer is available to agencies that commit to 
a new FirstNet Mobile--Unlimited for Smartphone line of service or 
eligible upgrade with either a 2-year service agreement or a new AT&T 
Installment 30-month agreement, among other conditions.

    LOCAL, STATE, AND TRIBAL ENGAGEMENT: The January GAO report on 
FirstNet described comments from some local, state, and Tribal 
stakeholders about a perceived lack of engagement. These stakeholders 
claimed that they initially had extensive consultations with FirstNet, 
but later were not receiving much information or transparency on 
broadband deployment and FirstNet oversight. GAO made several 
recommendations to FirstNet on improving information-sharing and 
collaboration with shareholders.

    Question 1. How does FirstNet partner with local communities, 
especially when selecting locations of new cell sites or other 
infrastructure.
    Answer. It has been my experience that FirstNet staff is very 
responsive to our requests, no matter those requests. I was not in on 
that ``ground level'' conversation when FirstNet was initially setting 
up the logistics on their infrastructure and service. My only 
experience has been moving from one carrier to the FirstNet plan and 
the request for deployables on three or four different events. South 
Dakota is a smaller state so there are not as many of us (Law 
Enforcement type) so the FirstNet folks know me well and I know them 
well and we have a good relationship.

    Question 2. I know that the cost of upgrading equipment can be a 
barrier for our state and local agencies. Do you know of any available 
grant funding to help state and local agencies transition to FirstNet?
    Answer. Again, I was not in on the ground level, so I am not 100 
percent of any grant funding available to transition. Our agency did 
not receive any grant funding to make the transition to FirstNet. I do 
know FirstNet provided us with substantial discounts not only for our 
office plans but also those deputies who moved their personal plans 
could do so at a discount under the FirstNet plan. We are grateful for 
that as any costs we can pass onto the taxpayer is a good thing.

    FirstNet plays a vital role ensuring public safety by enabling 
connectivity, especially in areas without reliable broadband. The 
COVID-19 pandemic underscores it importance. However, in conducting 
oversight of FirstNet, the Government Accountability Office (``GAO'') 
found local, state, and tribal stakeholders felt a lack of engagement 
by FirstNet and AT&T. The stakeholders described minimal contact and 
insufficient information from FirstNet and AT&T. At the hearing, Mr. 
Parkinson and Mr. Porter introduced firstnet.gov, explaining that 
public safety officials in each state could use this website to locate 
the name, phone number, and e-mail for the FirstNet point of contact in 
their state. While a start, this falls short of addressing the greater 
transparency and information sharing recommended by the GAO report. I 
seek additional information about FirstNet and AT&T's accountability to 
stakeholders like you and any improvements they made in light of the 
GAO report.

    Question 1. In accordance with GAO's recommendations, has FirstNet 
and AT&T made DC-specific commitments and metrics available to you?
    Answer. Yes, FirstNet has made DC-specific commitments and metrics 
available to us. Specifically, in December 2017 FirstNet submitted a 
letter to Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser outlining all the 
commitments related to network build and offer elements they were 
prepared to make upon the city's opt-in. These commitments include 
building ten (10) new sites to provide additional coverage within the 
District of Columbia within 5 years of opt in, a 3 million dollar 
investment to enhance in-building coverage, consideration of the city's 
specific requirements in their National Disaster Recovery Plan, support 
with locating and establishing a highly secure site for the FirstNet 
Satellite Colt, access to deployable assets and the NDR team and its 
assets, as well as LTE connectivity on five (5) command vehicles for 
first responders.
    FirstNet has honored its commitment to provide all these resources.

    Question 2. FirstNet recently launched their website, firstnet.gov, 
to provide contact information for the FirstNet Authority 
representative in each state. Have you used this website? Are there 
other primary methods you use to contact and communicate with FirstNet 
and AT&T?
    Answer. When the Office of Unified Communications, the city's 911/
311 center, signed on we were provided with points of contact who have 
been consistently accessible and available. In addition to this primary 
method of contact, the agency is also aware of FirstNet's user help 
desk, which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The agency 
receives an extremely informative bi-weekly newsletter as well.
    The Office of Unified Communications has not needed to use the 
recently launched website to obtain contact information for FirstNet 
Authority representatives.

    Question 3. Have you had any issues with transparency or 
information sharing from FirstNet and AT&T?
    Answer. Shortly after opt in the District of Columbia's Statewide 
Interoperability Coordinator (SWIC) and the Office of Unified 
Communications supported a user performance and reliability test of the 
FirstNet system during a large-scale event. Official requests for the 
test results were not honored immediately and the city was engaged in a 
protracted exchange in order to obtain the test data. Several months 
later, the results, which were favorable, were released.
    Since that time several other similar tests have been conducted and 
the results of each have been released immediately upon request.

    Question 4. The GAO report recommended increased transparency and 
sharing of deployment and oversight information with stakeholders. 
Since this recommendation, have you noticed any change in quantity or 
quality of communications from FirstNet and AT&T?
    Answer. Since the challenges described in the response to Question 
3, the Office of Unified Communications has experienced greatly 
improved transparency and responsiveness. In addition, representatives 
from FirstNet and AT&T consistently participate and contribute to the 
District's monthly Interoperability Communications Committee (ICC) 
meetings and also on bi-weekly in-building coverage project status 
meetings.

    Question 5. Do you have any recommendations for how FirstNet and 
AT&T can better support public safety officials like you?
    Answer. As public safety officials we are concerned about 
FirstNet's seeming non-response to Verizon's competitive campaign and 
efforts to maintain their presence in the public safety market. We 
believe that this may be causing confusion for other public safety 
organizations and could be a factor in their delay in opting in. 
Further we are concerned that if many of these organizations do not 
sign on with FirstNet, the result will be contrary to the objective of 
creating a true nationwide network.

    Answer. The Office of Unified Communications (OUC) is not aware of 
any available grant funding to support transitions to FirstNet. 
Fortunately, however, the cost for the OUC to transition was not 
prohibitive.
