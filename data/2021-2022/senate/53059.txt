           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    The Chair. Good morning, everyone. Today, we are 
considering the nomination of Polly Trottenberg to be Deputy 
Secretary of Transportation. The Deputy Secretary is the number 
two spot at the Department of Transportation and plays a 
critical role in ensuring the safety and security of our 
Nation's transportation system. Ms. Trottenberg is eminently 
qualified for this role.
    After 30 years of transportation expertise already under 
her belt, most recently with the City of New York as 
Transportation Commissioner from 2014 to 2020, I think she has 
a great understanding of our Nation's transportation needs. She 
helped implement the country's first Vision Zero Traffic Safety 
Program--Vision Zero is an ambitious idea that will help us 
tolerate and prevent basically unwanted deaths in our streets 
by having better systems--and is a tireless advocate for 
equitable and important transportation projects throughout our 
major cities.
    U.S. Department of Transportation will be familiar with Ms. 
Trottenberg. She served in the Department of Transportation 
from 2009 to 2014, first as Assistant Secretary for Policy and 
later as Undersecretary for Policy, the third ranking official 
at DOT. And in those important roles, she was responsible for 
implementing legislation developing key transportation 
initiatives, including starting up the TIGER Grant Program now 
known as the Bill Discretionary Grant Program. And I can just 
tell you already a lot of the questions I am going to have is 
going to be around freight and major transportation 
infrastructure investment that our economy in the Pacific 
Northwest depends on. So thank you for your leadership there. 
And as a testament to her success of the Department, Secretary 
Ray LaHood, Ms. Trottenberg's former boss, is also going to be 
joining us today to, I think to discuss properly via the web 
your expertise and his support for you. So we are certainly 
welcoming him back to this committee and thank him for all of 
his leadership particularly.
    I would like to thank him for his leadership on moving 
freight. In addition to her work in Congress in 2008, Ms. 
Trottenberg became the first Executive Director of Building 
America's Future, a nonprofit organization that supported 
increased investment in infrastructure and major transportation 
policy reform, and obviously, your great educational 
background. We are so excited to have you here in a leadership 
position. Our Nation's State Departments of Transportation are 
estimating that $50 billion in revenue losses over the next 5 
years due to COVID-19. So our airports have lost over $23 
billion and reduction from traveling public. Our transit 
agencies have lost $50 billion in revenue as of 2021, something 
you can probably speak directly to. And in the State of 
Washington, we are facing a $1.14 billion in transportation 
revenue loss over the next 10 years as a result of the COVID 
pandemic. So I can tell you that that story now with a story 
that is going to come out today, Americans Safety, American 
Society of Civil Engineers, who are basically going to say this 
is the investment America needs to make in transportation or 
our economy through GDP is going to lose trillions of dollars.
    So we have the COVID story of lost revenue, and we have 
assessment by our civil engineers saying we need much more 
investment in transportation infrastructure. So facing this 
economic outlook, it is critical that we have someone with Ms. 
Trottenberg's leadership and expertise to help us in the 
transportation sector. Of course, in the pandemic, we will need 
to get people moving. That includes Amtrak and the airlines, 
and the aviation sector overall, and certainly support workers 
who are just trying to get to and from their work in their 
daily lives. So all of this is a difficult task, but we know 
that you are up to it.
    I want to mention a couple of things that I believe are 
critical to our infrastructure in the future in my state. Sound 
transit is in the midst of one of its biggest expansions in the 
nation, really, and it faces a billion dollar shortfall in 
budget, also impacted by COVID and the loss of local investment 
that taxpayers would have normally been putting into the 
system. And due to the pandemic, we see the challenges that it 
will face and really completing this project at as has been 
imagined. There are also many freight projects in the Northwest 
in places like the West Seattle Bridge, which are suffering 
from critical cracks in the concrete. Infrastructure has made 
it unsafe to make our ports as cost effective as they could be 
in delivering freight.
    And so we need to have a backup. We are talking about 
moving not just products from the Northwest but products 
throughout the United States from the Midwest who come through 
our ports to travel to Asia. So there are many other examples 
of major investments, whether it is the Columbia River crossing 
or the Trussell in Everett. There are many examples where we in 
the Pacific Northwest need to keep people moving. That 
investment will mean job growth and help our economy in the 
future.
    So I look forward to having a chance to ask you questions, 
but more importantly, I look forward to having you confirmed 
and over at the Department of Transportation so we can get to 
work on these many issues. Now, I will turn to my Ranking 
Member for his opening statement, Senator Wicker.

                STATEMENT OF HON. ROGER WICKER, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI

    Senator Wicker. Senator Cantwell, thank you very much for 
holding this hearing and congratulations on negotiating the 
streets of Washington, D.C. to arrive very near the starting 
time. I want to welcome Polly Trottenberg as the President's 
nominee to be Deputy Secretary of Transportation. I do want to 
note that I believe the preparation timeline was rushed for a 
hearing on such a significant position at the Department of 
Transportation. We had just a few days to review all of Ms. 
Trottenberg's paperwork after it was submitted. And to Ms. 
Trottenberg's credit, she has a lengthy professional record 
containing decisions made in speeches given over the course of 
many years.
    So I just want to state for the record that the vetting 
process for nominees under consideration by this committee 
should be thorough and there should always be sufficient time 
for careful consideration. I am gently observing that I hope 
the rushed process here will be an exception. Ms. Trottenberg 
was a staff member in the Senate for approximately 12 years 
while working for three different Senators, and this career 
background should give her a helpful perspective. Additionally, 
she has appeared before our committee several times when she 
was nominated to serve as Assistant Secretary of Transportation 
Policy, Undersecretary of Transportation for Policy, and as a 
Government witness during the Obama Administration. Ms. 
Trottenberg has other notable public service experience which 
could significantly benefit the American public. Over the past 
7 years, she has served as Commissioner of the New York City 
Department of Transportation.
    I hope this experience has given her a fresh perspective on 
the regulatory and budgetary difficulties that local 
governments face while also performing our views--informing her 
views on how the U.S. Department of Transportation can be of 
assistance to states and municipalities. I look forward to 
hearing from Ms. Trottenberg today regarding how she would 
assist Secretary Buttigieg and President Biden in addressing 
the transportation challenges facing our country. Some of these 
challenges include crafting a bipartisan agreement to pass the 
next surface transportation reauthorization bill and the 
potential consideration of infrastructure legislation.
    I want to take this opportunity to raise a word of caution 
and concern to the nominee and to my colleagues. Any such 
legislation should be passed in a bipartisan fashion. 
Transportation issues have a tremendous impact on all Americans 
and therefore all Members of Congress should be included in the 
legislative process regarding such issues. This has been our 
tradition. The current budget reconciliation process is a prime 
example of an overtly partisan exercise that would not best 
address American infrastructure needs. I raised a number of key 
matters with Secretary Buttigieg at his confirmation hearing, 
and so I will not repeat all of them now.
    I would also note that I was pleased to report--vote to 
report the nomination and to support the nomination on the 
floor. I do want to emphasize one of my top priorities 
restoring Amtrak service along the Gulf Coast, where it was 
halted after Hurricane Katrina more than 15 years ago, way too 
long, and I will look forward to working with Ms. Trottenberg 
on this issue if she is confirmed. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    The Chair. Well, thank you, Senator Wicker, and thank you 
for your indulgence in allowing us to have this hearing today. 
I certainly plan for us to follow due process here in giving 
consideration for members to make sure their time and questions 
and everything are answered. I certainly appreciate the 
courtesy of having this today because of all of the things that 
are going on in transportation.
    Aviation safety issues continue to plague us. The amount of 
resources, as you are mentioning, in the COVID packages now and 
in the future related to transportation investments. We 
definitely could use a full suite of people at DOT to help us 
on those. And I certainly expect to be working in a bipartisan 
basis together on the fact that the surface transportation bill 
is up for reauthorization and it has to be, in my opinion, 
worked out together. So with that, I am going to turn to our 
special guest who wants to say a few words. And we are so 
pleased to have former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood with 
us today.
    Again, thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your years of service 
in the Department of Transportation. And I personally want to 
thank you again for your efforts to establish a national 
freight program. It has meant a lot to, I think, the movement 
of goods and to the GDP of our economy. So, with that.

           STATEMENT OF HON. RAY LaHOOD, SECRETARY, 
               U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

    Mr. LaHood. Thank you, Chair Cantwell and to the entire 
committee. I have such fond memories of appearing before the 
Commerce Committee during my time as Secretary and certainly a 
lot of good memories of working with Chair Cantwell on freight 
transportation, which she made one of her top priorities while 
we were at the Department. And to my dear former colleague, 
Ranking Member Senator Wicker, who he and I came to Congress 
together in 1995 and served together while we were both in the 
House. And obviously, he got a great promotion from the people 
of his state to serve in the Senate.
    And Roger and I worked very closely together as members of 
the House during our time. And certainly while I was at DOT, we 
were--continued our friendship. I also want to give a shout out 
to David Strickland, because while I was at DOT, David was a 
part of our team. He was the Administrator of NHTSA and did a 
terrific job really tackling a lot of tough, tough safety 
issues. And I am proud of David and the work that he is now 
doing as Staff Director for the Senate Commerce Committee. It 
is an honor for me today to introduce Polly Trottenberg, the 
nominee to be the Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of 
Transportation.
    And as I said, I am delighted to be back before the Senate 
Commerce Committee, where I think I have a lot of friends, some 
former colleagues, but many that I worked with while I was 
Secretary. I think Polly's experience really breaks down into 
three different categories: her Congressional experience, her 
local Government experience in the City of New York, and her 
experience at DOT. And to be honest, I can't think of anyone 
more qualified to help Secretary Buttigieg lead the Department 
of Transportation. Polly is the right person for this job.
    I know many of you are familiar with Polly, given her 
nearly three decades of public service. She served for 12 years 
as a Senate staffer working for Senator Moynihan, Senator 
Schumer, and Senator Boxer. She has a deep understanding of 
transportation policy and the important work of your committee. 
During her time in the Senate, she practiced bipartisan 
coalition building to help achieve successful legislative 
outcomes. And I know your committee does that also. She worked 
intimately on both, T21 and SAFETEA-LU. During my time as 
Secretary, I recognized Polly's thoughtful leadership in 
transportation and recommended her for both Assistant Secretary 
for Transportation Policy and later to become the number three 
person at DOT, the Undersecretary for Transportation Policy.
    Polly was and always continued to be the ultimate team 
player, carrying out President Obama and Ray LaHood's highest 
priorities for safety in every mode of transportation. Both 
Secretary Buttigieg and Polly know the important role cities 
play in transportation, cities of all sizes. Cities are the 
ones--cities are the incubators. Cities are where the action 
actions at. And having just come from the City of New York as 
the Commissioner of Transportation, I think her leadership will 
lend itself well to President Biden's agenda in recognizing 
that cities and states are where the action is at. And Polly 
served for the last 7 years as Commissioner of the City 
Department of Transportation in New York. Her strong 
operational experience helped her lead an agency that impacted 
the daily lives of New York City's 8 million residents.
    Polly's commitment to safety continued as she implemented 
the landmark Vision Zero Program, a comprehensive approach to 
eliminate traffic fatalities and injuries. I know Polly looks 
forward to working closely with every member of this committee 
in a bipartisan way. She will listen. She will be available. 
She will answer your phone calls. And she will always make 
safety her number one priority.
    So Chair Cantwell and Ranking Member Wicker and to the 
other members of this committee, thank you for allowing me a 
minute or two to say a few words about someone who I respect 
and admire, and think will do a terrific job, an excellent job, 
a very professional job as the number two person at the 
Department of Transportation. I appreciate the opportunity.
    The Chair. Well, thank you, Secretary LaHood. And you are 
welcome back any time before the Committee. And we certainly, 
again, appreciate your being here in support of Ms. Trottenberg 
today. Ms. Trottenberg, we will turn it over to you for an 
opening statement.

               STATEMENT OF POLLY E. TROTTENBERG,

                NOMINEE TO BE DEPUTY SECRETARY,

               U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you, Chair Cantwell and Ranking 
Member Wicker and members of the Committee. It is an honor to 
appear before you today as the Nominee for Deputy Secretary of 
the U.S. Department of Transportation. I do very much 
appreciate the Committee enabling me to have my hearing today. 
I want to thank President Biden and Secretary Buttigieg for 
selecting me to fill this important role.
    I certainly want to thank Secretary Ray LaHood for his 
generous introduction. I loved working for him, and I learned 
so much about leadership serving under him at U.S. DOT. I want 
to introduce, I have with me today my husband, Mark Zuckerman, 
my stepdaughter Naomi, my stepson Noah. I am so grateful for 
their love and support. If I am honored enough to be confirmed, 
I pledge that I will work diligently to support Secretary 
Buttigieg and the extraordinary team at the Department as we 
seek to recover from COVID-19 and invest in our infrastructure 
and our future. I would also work closely with members of this 
committee to advance our Nation's transportation goals. The 
Department of Transportation's highest priority will always be 
safety across all modes, including aviation, roadways, mass 
transit, rail, waterways, and pipelines.
    In response to the pandemic, the Biden Administration has 
made the safety of the traveling public and the transportation 
workforce a top goal. At the Department, the strong team that 
the Secretary has assembled is building on the efforts of 
Secretary Chao and her team to respond to COVID-19. If 
confirmed, I look forward to supporting that effort. 
Transportation is essential to the President's build back 
better plan, which will connect people to jobs and opportunity, 
strengthen our Nation's small businesses, manufacturing, and 
agricultural sectors, revitalize communities that have not 
shared equitably in our Nation's prosperity, foster innovation 
and global competitiveness, improve resiliency, and help tackle 
climate change.
    To support this work, I believe in nearly three decades of 
operational, managerial, and policymaking experience, including 
the last 7 years as New York City's Commissioner of 
Transportation and my prior service at U.S. DOT has prepared me 
to serve the American people. During my time in New York, as 
you heard, I was responsible for managing a multibillion dollar 
transportation agency that impacted the daily lives of the 
city's 8.6 million residents. I prioritized roadway safety as 
the first U.S. city to adopt Vision Zero, a comprehensive and 
data driven program to eliminate all traffic fatalities and 
severe injuries while increasing safe, sustainable, and 
equitable mobility for all.
    Even as traffic fatalities rose nationally, through our 
efforts in New York, we saw years of safer streets for all road 
users. I also focused on providing better mobility options, 
including more reliable bus service, particularly in 
underserved communities. I worked to expand cycling and bring 
in new technologies like e-scooters and cargo bikes, as well as 
growing our passenger ferry service. And we provided those 
options in very close collaboration with local communities and 
stakeholders, seeking their input and insights to make our 
projects even better, which I would do at the Department of 
Transportation if confirmed.
    I also worked with State and regional partners to find 
solutions to the larger transportation challenges the New York 
metropolitan region faced, growing congestion, aging highways, 
bridges and transit infrastructure, the urgent need to make our 
sidewalks and mass transit system fully accessible to people 
with disabilities, and to make our entire transportation system 
more equitable, sustainable, and resilient.
    On the operational side, I prioritized innovation, better 
project delivery, stronger agency planning, and transparency 
and value for taxpayer dollars. In my previous roles at U.S. 
DOT, I focused on policy aimed at creating a more robust, 
sustainable, accessible, and performance-based transportation 
system with strong partnerships at the Federal, state, local, 
tribal, and territorial levels. I helped implement the TIGER, 
now built, and High-Speed Rail Programs, working to address the 
needs of State and local transportation agencies on every type 
of project, from roads and bridges, transit and rail, airports, 
ports, and pipelines. I also focused on strengthening and 
investing in multimodal national freight network and bolstering 
the Department's credit programs to enable a broader range of 
projects to participate.
    Prior to U.S. DOT, I did have the privilege of serving as a 
Senate staffer for 12 years working on transportation 
legislation and have a deep understanding of the importance of 
this committee and how its members work to meet the needs of 
their constituents and their communities. I also know how 
important it is to listen to and work with Members of Congress 
and a broad range of stakeholders to find bipartisan solutions 
to the challenges we face. Throughout my career, I have always 
valued the ability to work with colleagues across the aisle on 
transportation issues and find bipartisan solutions.
    If confirmed, I look forward to working with you all. As we 
begin to emerge from the pandemic, we face a once in a 
generation opportunity to improve our transportation system and 
ensure that it equitably serves all Americans in communities 
both large and small. If confirmed, I look forward to working 
with you all to achieve these goals. In closing, I thank the 
Committee again for the opportunity to appear before you today 
and I welcome your questions.

stepdaughter Naomi, and my stepson Noah.
    If I am honored enough to be confirmed, I pledge that I will work 
diligently to support Secretary Buttigieg and the extraordinary team at 
the Department as we seek to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and 
invest in our infrastructure and our future. I would also work closely 
with the Members of this Committee to advance our Nation's 
transportation goals.
    The Department of Transportation's highest priority will always be 
safety, across all modes, including aviation, roadways, mass transit, 
rail, waterways and pipelines. In response to the pandemic, the Biden 
Administration has made the safety of the traveling public and the 
transportation workforce a top goal. At the Department, the strong team 
that the Secretary has assembled is building on the efforts of 
Secretary Chao and her team to respond to COVID-19. If confirmed, I 
look forward to supporting that effort.
    Transportation is essential to the President's Build Back Better 
plan, which will:

   Connect people to jobs and opportunity;

   Strengthen our Nation's small businesses, manufacturing and 
        agricultural sectors;

   Revitalize communities that have not shared equitably in our 
        Nation's prosperity;

   Foster innovation and global competitiveness;

   Improve resiliency; and

   Help our Nation tackle climate change.

    To support this work, I believe my nearly three decades of 
operational, managerial, and policymaking experience--including the 
last seven years as New York City's Commissioner of Transportation and 
my prior service at the U.S. Department of Transportation--has prepared 
me to serve the American people.
    During my time in New York, I was responsible for managing a multi-
billion-dollar transportation agency that impacts the daily lives of 
the City's 8.6 million residents. I prioritized roadway safety as the 
first U.S. city to adopt Vision Zero, a comprehensive and data-driven 
program to eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe injuries, while 
increasing safe, sustainable and equitable mobility for all. Even as 
traffic fatalities rose nationally, through our efforts in New York, we 
saw years of safer streets for all road users.
    I also focused on providing better mobility options, including more 
reliable bus service, particularly in underserved communities. I worked 
to expand cycling and bring in new technologies like e-scooters and 
cargo bikes, as well as growing passenger ferry service. And we 
provided those options in very close collaboration with local 
communities and stakeholders, seeking their input and insights to make 
our projects even better, which I would do at the U.S. Department of 
Transportation if confirmed.
    I also worked with state and regional partners to find solutions to 
the larger transportation challenges the New York Metropolitan region 
faced--growing congestion, aging highways, bridge and transit 
infrastructure, the urgent need to make our sidewalks and mass transit 
system fully accessible to people with disabilities, and to make our 
entire transportation system more equitable, sustainable and resilient. 
On the operational side, I prioritized innovation, better project 
delivery, stronger agency planning, and transparency and value for 
taxpayer dollars.
    In my previous roles at the U.S. Department of Transportation, I 
focused on policy aimed at creating a more robust, sustainable, 
accessible and performance-based transportation system with strong 
partnerships at the federal, state, local, Tribal and territorial 
levels. I helped implement the TIGER and High-Speed Rail programs, 
working to address the needs of state and local transportation agencies 
on every type of project: from roads and bridges, to transit and rail, 
to airports, ports and pipelines. I also focused on strengthening and 
investing in a national multimodal freight network and bolstering the 
Department's credit programs to enable a broader range of projects to 
participate.
    Prior to the U.S. Department of Transportation, I had the privilege 
of serving as a Senate staffer for 12 years working on transportation 
legislation and have a deep understanding of the importance of this 
Committee and how its Members work to meet the needs of their 
constituents and their communities. I also know how important it is to 
listen to and work with Members of Congress and a broad range of 
stakeholders to find bipartisan solutions to the challenges we face. 
Throughout my career, I always valued the ability to work with 
colleagues across the aisle on transportation issues and find 
bipartisan solutions. If confirmed, I look forward to working with you 
all.
    As we begin to emerge from the pandemic, we face a once-in-a-
generation opportunity to improve our transportation system and ensure 
that it equitably serves all Americans--in communities both large and 
small. If confirmed, I look forward to working with you all to achieve 
these goals.
    In closing, I thank the Committee for the opportunity to appear 
before you today and I welcome your questions.

    20. Given the current mission, major programs, and major 
operational objectives of the department/agency to which you have been 
nominated, what in your background or employment experience do you 
believe affirmatively qualifies you for appointment to the position for 
which you have been nominated, and why do you wish to serve in that 
position?
    Transportation has been a lifelong passion and career path for me, 
and I am deeply committed to helping lead a department that prioritizes 
safety for the traveling public and workforce, job creation, economic 
growth and competitiveness, environmental sustainability, equity, 
accessibility and improving the quality of life for all Americans. I 
have over 25 years of public sector experience at the Federal, State 
and local levels and have served in a number of relevant high-level 
transportation operational, managerial, and policymaking roles that 
qualify me to serve as USDOT's Deputy Secretary.
    For the past seven years, I have served as the Commissioner of the 
New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT), one of the 
Nation's largest and most complex municipal transportation agencies. At 
NYCDOT, I managed an annual operating budget of over $1 billion and a 
$17.3 billion 10-year capital plan. During my tenure, I focused on 
building a high-performing team that prioritized safety, environmental 
sustainability, accessibility and equity and a diverse, inclusive 
workplace and agency culture. Over the last year, I led NYCDOT through 
the COVID-19 response and recovery, with a focus on the safety of our 
5,800-person workforce and the traveling public.
    Prior to my role as the Commissioner of NYCDOT, I served for five 
years at USDOT in the Obama Administration, as the Under Secretary of 
Transportation for Policy, the third ranking official at the 
Department, and as Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy. I 
also have over 20 years of policy and managerial experience in the U.S. 
Senate working for three U.S. Senators as well as the Aviation 
Department of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the 
Department of Administration and Finance at the Massachusetts Port 
Authority, and in running an infrastructure non-profit focused on 
transportation.
    I am honored to be nominated by President Biden to be part of 
Secretary Pete Buttigieg's leadership team at USDOT. I believe that my 
high-level operational experience running a major municipal 
transportation agency, my previous service at USDOT, and my other 
professional experience at all levels of government have prepared me, 
if confirmed, to serve as Deputy Secretary.
    21. What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to 
ensure that the department/agency has proper management and accounting 
controls, and what experience do you have in managing a large 
organization?
    The Deputy Secretary has a primary responsibility for the 
management and accounting controls of the agency, as well as other 
major operational oversight duties. As noted above, I have extensive 
experience managing a large, municipal transportation agency with a 
world-class leadership team and a large and very diverse workforce, in 
a very complex political, fiscal and legal environment, especially 
during the COVID pandemic. I also have extensive experience as a senior 
appointed official at USDOT itself and am highly familiar with many of 
the agency's functions, procedures and challenges.
    22. What do you believe to be the top three challenges facing the 
department/agency, and why?
    The top challenge USDOT faces will always be safety. This challenge 
is particularly urgent in the face of COVID-19 and its devastating toll 
on the operations and financial condition of our Nation's 
transportation system and its direct impacts on the transportation 
workforce as well as the traveling public. USDOT has a central role in 
creating a safe and healthy transportation system, particularly through 
its operational role in the Nation's air traffic control system and its 
safety regulatory role for aviation, rail, transit, roadways, motor 
vehicles, trucks and buses, and pipelines.
    USDOT also has a crucial role to play in the challenge of economic 
recovery from COVID and in the Nation's overall job creation, economic 
growth and manufacturing competitiveness. And we have the potential to 
deliver an environmentally sustainable transportation system, which 
will address climate change and create jobs, foster innovation and new 
technologies, and provide equity and opportunity for all Americans.
    Finally, USDOT faces the managerial challenges of a complex 
operating environment and in administering a growing number of 
resource-intensive grant and credit programs. USDOT also faces 
challenges in managing a broad array of regulatory processes in a 
period of rapid technological change in the transportation sector.

    The Chair. Ms. Trottenberg, thank you so much for that 
statement, your willingness to serve, and again, for your work 
over many years here in the Senate and working in the 
Department of Transportation. So I have a basic question we ask 
all nominees. If you are confirmed, will you pledge to work 
collaboratively with this committee, provide thorough and 
timely response to our requests for information, and work 
together to address important policy issues?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I pledge to do so.
    The Chair. Thank you. I mentioned sound transit. I think 
this is a good place to start given your past years of 
experience. We are experiencing $1 billion shortfall. The 
problem is, you know, this program originally was intended to 
build a spine up and down Puget Sound from Tacoma to Everett. 
And obviously various things have changed along the project. 
But the bottom line is that the COVID pandemic has left us with 
a big shortfall. And so we want these projects to continue. We 
want these major hubs of manufacturing to be connected.
    So do you believe we need to provide additional transit 
agencies nationwide with revenues to help deal with the 
shortfall from the pandemic? And what do you think we can do to 
help give tools to these agencies, so they continue their 
important work and make sure these projects are completed?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thanks for that question, Madam Chair. And 
look, it is no question the pandemic has had a devastating 
effect not only on the transit agencies in big cities like 
Seattle and New York, but in rural transit agencies too. You 
know, the plummeting ridership, the need to invest in more, you 
know, sanitation protocols and cleaning protocols and workforce 
protection has left a lot of transit agencies reeling. I know 
that Congress has already and some of its relief packages taken 
some great steps to help the transit agencies recover.
    I think we will probably need to continue to work together 
on that. We certainly, just as you are mentioning in sound 
transit, we don't want to see important capital projects 
derailed for all these systems all over the country. It would 
be very hard to come back and make up that lost ground. And I 
know the Department has a role to play in making sure we help 
to keep these projects moving to be as, you know, efficient and 
streamlined as we can so we don't lose ground.
    The Chair. Thank you. We must also address multimodal 
freight bottlenecks such as the West Seattle Bridge 
replacement, the I-5 Bridge replacement, which connects 
Washington, Oregon, the Apple capital loop in Wenatchee. These 
are major infrastructure investments that also need support. So 
do you support increasing the freight infrastructure program or 
lifting the caps that they have on the limits of multimodal 
projects?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I certainly do, Senator. Something we 
actually got to work together on in the Obama Administration. 
And, you know, one of the key areas that bring together so many 
parts of the country, I think during the pandemic. You know, 
certainly it hit home for all of us how absolutely crucial our 
supply chain was, our need to move freight to make sure we were 
keeping our supermarket stocked, our industries moving in these 
challenging times. You know, we really look forward to working 
with you all on that. I think there is a lot more we can do to 
strengthen the Nation's freight network and make sure we remain 
in a position of, you know, dominant global competitiveness 
when it comes to our supply chains.
    The Chair. A related issue, I believe, is at grade 
crossings. We have 128,000 public railroad crossings in the 
United States, 62 percent of which are in rural communities. 
And they are also a gateway to moving these products. Do you 
think we need to make some changes or dedicated funding to help 
relieve some of the blocked--challenges we are facing with 
safety and capacity at our railroad crossings?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Would certainly like to work with you all 
in that. I mean, I know there are two elements, particularly, 
as you know, freight movement on trains. The trains have gotten 
longer and that poses both safety challenges. And we are, you 
know, we are still losing too many lives in this country at 
grade crossings, and also just for communities bisected by 
those long freight trains and how that can, you know, slow down 
travel and impact emergency responses. So, yes, certainly an 
area we should work together and make investments.
    The Chair. And one of our other issues we have to deal with 
is obviously the impact on transportation on our salmon 
population in the Northwest. So as we are building highway 
projects, we want to make sure that the environmental impacts 
of these infrastructures are also considered. So I hope you 
will work with us on those issues and continuing the efforts of 
mitigation.
    Ms. Trottenberg. You have my commitment to do so.
    The Chair. Yes, thank you. Senator Wicker.
    Senator Wicker. Well, the distinguished Chair has yielded 
back 41 seconds. Thank you, Ms. Trottenberg, for being with us 
today. I appreciate your testimony. Let me just say I am 
delighted to hear the conversation about freight infrastructure 
improvements, about addressing the issue with grade crossings. 
It is something that is an issue in the Southeast as well as in 
the Northwest and all over the country. So glad to have that 
discussed. I think the freight and passenger rail can coexist 
and do just fine. It may not shock you that I am going to ask 
about restoring Amtrak service on the Gulf Coast between 
Mobile, the Gulf Coast counties of Mississippi, and New 
Orleans.
    You know, New Orleans, of course, one of our major 
metropolitan centers in the country, a metropolitan area of 1.2 
million people, and the service that was--has been interrupted 
now for 15 and a half years was from this major metropolitan 
area to Mobile County, which is about a county of over 400,000 
people and passing through the three most populous counties of 
South Mississippi being Hancock, Harrison, and Jackson 
counties.
    Have you looked at this and can you discuss whether or not 
you are committed to supporting the local and State Governments 
who have weighed in on behalf of restoring Amtrak service along 
the Gulf Coast?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thanks for the question, Senator, and I 
certainly am very familiar with your support for this project. 
I have looked into it. I am a big, enthusiastic supporter of 
passenger rail and certainly want to look forward to working 
with you and Amtrak and potentially the host railroads to make 
sure that we can restore the service. I understand that it is 
so important for that part of the country.
    Senator Wicker. Very important. And have you been down to 
the Gulf Coast of Mississippi lately?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I haven't been lately. I did get the 
opportunity to take actually a different train, the crescent 
train, all the way from New York down through the Gulf Coast to 
New Orleans. So I have ridden----
    Senator Wicker. Well, we are going to invite you back to 
look at this New Orleans to Mississippi to Mobile route. And I 
think you will be impressed by the beauty in the area, but also 
the potential there and the public support that we have. So I 
hope you will consent to accepting an invitation.
    Ms. Trottenberg. It would be a pleasure.
    Senator Wicker. Now, let's talk about the FAST Act. And, 
you know, Senator Cantwell and I struggle with funds. We 
appreciate the grants and the bill and things like that. But we 
had to do an abbreviated FAST Act last year, just a 1-year 
extension. We need to do better than that. And I hope you agree 
that we do. How do you think the Administration will propose to 
pay for a major multi-year FAST Act reauthorization?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you for that question, Senator. And 
certainly, again, in my time on the Hill, at U.S. DOT have been 
involved in a number of the big surface reauthorizations. And I 
certainly agree with you, having long term bills, I can speak 
now as a local transportation official, is so important for 
State and local transportation agencies to have some of that 
certainty in knowing, you know, what the Federal funding 
picture is going to look like for a number of years.
    I know that the Secretary, when he was before this 
committee, talked about the fact that the Administration is 
interested in, I think, a big important surface transportation 
reauthorization proposal. I am not in a position today to tell 
you exactly, I think, what they might be looking at in terms of 
funding. But I know the Secretary spoke about the fact that he 
very much wants to work with members of this committee and 
other committees of jurisdiction to find a way to make the kind 
of investments we need in our transportation system.
    Senator Wicker. Do you have any idea when the Secretary and 
the President will move toward actually coming up with a 
proposal? Because, you know, here we are now. We have a new 
President. We have a new Secretary. We will soon have you, 
undoubtedly. And we are going to need proposals. So when do 
you--what is your information about how the spending and the 
revenue part of it will be formulated?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Well, I am not in the Department yet, so I 
haven't been part of sort of those intimate discussions. But I 
certainly know that the Administration, obviously, their big 
immediate focus has been COVID relief and the reconciliation 
bill. But I know there are discussions underway about what will 
be in the President's budget. You know, what potentially 
looking at stimulus and a surface bill. And we understand loud 
and clear from members here on the Hill that there is a big 
desire for the Administration to come soon with proposals and 
ideas.
    Senator Wicker. Well, thank you and good luck to you, Ms. 
Trottenberg. Let me just say this, Madam Chair, you and I and 
every member of this committee knows that transportation 
programs have to be paid for and the scheme we've had over the 
last little while has not been adequate to pay for what we 
need, and we might as well fess up as adults that this is going 
to cost money and that there is, I think, a realization out 
there among the public that if you get a good, well built, 
solid asset, at the end of the day, the American people don't 
mind paying for something that's done well.
    But we are going to have to be realistic and I hope the 
Administration will be coming forward soon with a solid 
recommendation on how to pay for roads and bridges and other 
forms of transportation. And thank you for indulging me there, 
Madam Chair.
    The Chair. Senator Wicker, always, always, always. Thank 
you so much. Senator Schatz.

                STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN SCHATZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII

    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to 
Ms. Trottenberg for our good conversation yesterday and for 
being willing to serve again in the Biden Administration. I 
want to start with your experience in New York City, in the 
city's Vision Zero initiative that helped to increase the 
number of bike lanes and sidewalks and bus lanes. And I just 
wonder whether you couldn't describe to the Committee what 
lessons you take from your experience in New York City and how 
that might inform your work at the Department of 
Transportation.
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you for that question, Senator. And 
I think, look, New York City is a very unique place, but I 
think I did learn a lot of lessons that I hope will be 
applicable to my work at the national level. Vision Zero proved 
a program, I think, that supported New Yorkers across the 
board. There is such a desire out there for safer streets. And 
one of the most, I think, moving parts of my job was getting to 
know some of the families who had lost loved ones in traffic 
crashes and, you know, working closely with them to find ways 
to redesign our streets, to make them safer for all users, 
safer for people in cars, as well as for pedestrians and 
cyclists, safer for our seniors and for our kids near our 
schools.
    We took a very data driven and very comprehensive approach, 
and we worked very closely with local communities. And I think 
that is a key at the national level as well. I am well aware, 
again, New York is unique in a lot of ways, and there is 
certainly not a one size fits all, but roadway safety is such 
an important priority and something that I think there is such 
a shared desire in this country to do more on. I mean, we are 
losing now about 36,000 people a year on our roadways, and that 
is far too many.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you for that and I really appreciate 
the framing here. The complete streets sort of branding has 
become polarizing, unfortunately, even though all we are saying 
is that depending on the time of day and the time of year and 
one's individual circumstances, one may end up being a 
pedestrian or a public transportation user or a driver. And so 
the idea that we are going to pit one user against the other, 
you know, sort of doesn't pass the reality test of the fact 
that all of us are oftentimes multiple kinds of users.
    And so I am wondering in terms of the urban and rural 
divide as it relates to some of these transportation policies, 
whether you think the complete street's model and a desire to 
get safer streets can work in more rural communities. As an 
example, the town of Lihue, an old plantation town on the 
island of Kauai, got a TIGER grant and then a follow up BUILD 
grant to do a sort of redevelopment of downtown Lihue.
    And it was supported with tons of enthusiasm from the 
Department of Transportation and also our mayor and our city 
council on the island of Kauai. Can you talk about safer 
streets as a rural issue, especially in small towns?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you. It is a good question. And 
roadway safety is an issue all over the country. And I know 
certainly talking to some of the members in preparing for this 
hearing, we see far too many fatalities on our rural roadways 
as well. So I think this is--I found you, as you say, Senator, 
sometimes these issues can be a bit polarizing, but roadway 
safety is an issue that really brings people together. And 
there are so many ways, I think, techniques we can use. They 
work on city streets. They work on streets in small towns. And 
they can work on rural highways as well.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you. Final question, how do you see 
the Department of Transportation as a driver in terms of 
climate action? I know the President has asked his entire 
cabinet, the entire Administration, the entire Federal 
Government to understand that climate change is no longer 
confined to the Department of Interior, perhaps the EPA and the 
Department of Energy, but rather every single Department has to 
work on dealing with the impacts of climate change, but also 
the opportunities related to taking climate action. And where 
do you see the best opportunities within the Department of 
Transportation to fulfill that mission articulated by the 
President?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you for that question. And I know 
when the Secretary was before you all, he spoke about what we 
describe as the whole of Government approach to climate. The 
Biden Administration has made climate change a top priority. 
And I am sure as members of this committee know, the 
transportation sector is the largest carbon emitting sector in 
our economy.
    And I think the Secretary has spoken, as has the President, 
I think so eloquently about how in transportation, tackling 
climate change is something that can really be an opportunity, 
an opportunity to embrace new technologies for, you know, 
American leadership and some of the emerging vehicle 
technologies that are out there.
    Also technologies in aviation and in the maritime sector. I 
think there are ways we can reduce the carbon footprint of the 
transportation sector while also doing some things that will 
help our economy grow. I think the Department is very excited 
about those efforts and really looks forward to working with 
all of you on that.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you very much.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Schatz. Senator Thune are you 
ready to--Senator Thune.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA

    Senator Thune. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Trottenberg, 
together with my--by the way, welcome to the Committee.
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you.
    Senator Thune. Together with my colleague, Senator Peters, 
we have worked over the past several years to enact automated 
vehicle legislation, which I believe is the key to ensuring 
that AVs are tested and deployed under a safe and consistent 
regulatory framework. And I remain committed to continue to 
work with Senator Peters to advance this critical emerging 
technology. AVs have the potential to dramatically reduce 
highway fatalities, relieve congestion, and provide a safe and 
accessible transportation option for the elderly and disabled.
    And I have been pleased to see NHTSA's recent actions to 
improve the testing and deployment of AVs through the granting 
of exemption petitions and updates to relevant regulations and 
I hope that the Department will continue to build on this 
important work. You mentioned in your testimony your work in 
reducing traffic and pedestrian fatalities and the importance 
of programs like Vision Zero. Do you see AVs as part of the 
solution to reducing traffic and pedestrian fatalities?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I do, Senator. Thank you for the question. 
Certainly, I think the AV technology holds the promise and it 
is exciting to think about of dramatically reducing fatalities 
on a roadway, some would hope eliminating them altogether. I 
agree with you, the Department has an important role to play 
in, you know, obviously both making sure that the testing and 
deployment is done in a safe way, but also helping to make sure 
we are facilitating this technology. And I spoke with your 
colleague, Senator Peters, about it yesterday and look forward 
to working with you all on that.
    Senator Thune. I was going to say, OK. If confirmed, you 
would make modernizing motor vehicle safety standards and 
working with Congress to create a uniform regulatory framework 
for AVs a priority?
    Ms. Trottenberg. If confirmed, yes.
    Senator Thune. Thank you. I want to come back to, you know, 
obviously we have got to do a surface transportation bill 
reauthorization. Maybe it is part of an infrastructure package. 
Who knows at this point? But we did have broad bipartisan 
cooperation on the last highway bill, which was the FAST Act in 
2015. And it was widely popular not only here, big vote in 
Congress, but among states. And there was, you know, a big 
bipartisan highway bill reported out of the Environment Public 
Works committee in the last Congress. And I guess my question 
is, as we work toward a surface transportation reauthorization 
in this Congress, I hope we can do so in a bipartisan manner 
and recognize that our Nation's diverse and highly 
interconnected transportation system.
    And one of the things I will emphasize is the importance of 
rural areas where the vast majority of agricultural, industrial 
commodities originate. I have said it before and I will say it 
again, but the investments we make in infrastructure benefit 
the entire country, not just rural areas by keeping the 
national transportation system fluid and interconnected. And I 
am curious about your overall views on that and how we might be 
able to work in a bipartisan way. There is a lot of discussion 
right now about doing something on infrastructure through 
reconciliation, which would be sort of one party as opposed to 
working across the aisle, which we have historically done on 
these.
    And second, how would we--how would we finance it? And what 
are your views about how to pay for, which has been the issue 
that has eluded folks up here now for many, many highway bills, 
and in many cases, we end up just adding it to the debt and 
passing the bill to our kids and grandkids, which I don't think 
is a conservative position, but it shouldn't even be a position 
that anybody on either side of the aisle ought to support. We 
need to pay for infrastructure. So give me your thoughts on 
that as we approach a reauthorization bill.
    Ms. Trottenberg. I will tackle each of your questions in 
turn. First, the question of freight network, absolutely 
essential. And was saying to your colleague, I think in some 
ways this pandemic year drove it home more than ever. You know, 
we relied so crucially on the supply chain to keep our 
supermarket stocked, to keep, you know, certainly big cities 
like New York going. It has been long an area of focus for me 
at the national level, something I did a lot of work on during 
the Obama Administration. And, you know, having spent time in 
your part of the country, recognize how crucial it is to get 
agricultural products to market, manufacturing products.
    And certainly an area I had like to work with you all on. 
Next question, I think urban versus rural. Certainly recognize 
national needs all over the country. And again, in my time as 
both a Federal official in the Obama Administration and my time 
here on the Hill, got to work so closely with members and 
localities all over the country, and, you know, recognize we--
you know, one of the priorities that this President has talked 
about is making sure that we are serving, when he speaks about 
equity, making sure that we are serving communities all over 
the country that perhaps have not fully shared a national 
prosperity. That can be urban and sometimes that is rural 
communities as well.
    And I know that is going to be a big focus of our 
Administration. He has also spoken about bipartisanship, and I 
have had the privilege in my time on the Hill to work on two 
very bipartisan surface transportation reauthorization bills 
and certainly hope that we will be able to do that again. And, 
you know, if confirmed, we would welcome the chance to work 
with you all on that.
    Senator Thune. Right. The one thing you didn't answer was 
the financing piece.
    Ms. Trottenberg. Oh, I am sorry, Senator. You are right. I 
did not answer the financing--.
    Senator Thune. Nobody ever wants to answer that question.
    Ms. Trottenberg. Ranking Member Wicker also asked me about 
that, and I am afraid I am--you know, I haven't joined the 
Administration yet. Still hoping to get confirmed. And I can't 
speak yet as to what kind of proposals they might put forth on 
financing. I do know, I mean, certainly the President has 
spoken about the need to make major new investments in 
transportation. And I think he has been a strong supporter of 
that. And I certainly have heard from your colleagues today. I 
hope that, if confirmed, will be part of the discussions with 
the Administration and we will have proposals soon to start 
talking to Members of Congress.
    Senator Thune. And I would just add, as part of those 
proposals, too, was, how do we pay for it? I mean, I think that 
is something we have got to deal with, and we have been putting 
off for way too long. So, Madam Chair? Alright, I will call on 
Senator Fischer is up next, my neighbor from Nebraska.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DEB FISCHER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA

    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Senator Thune. Ms. Trottenberg, 
it is so nice to see you here. We had a great discussion a week 
or so ago, and I really enjoyed bringing to your attention a 
number of issues and then your response and your thoughts on 
some of the things that you have accomplished in your previous 
work and what you are looking forward to working on now. So 
thank you for being here today.
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Fischer. We discussed about an FMCSA rule that came 
out last year and it made targeted reforms to the truck hours 
of service requirements that are there. That is a challenge 
that we continue to see. It is a challenge to be able to get to 
a final rule. And I hope that we will be able to see the 
Administration and you, and your position be able to support 
that. So if confirmed, will you ensure that the final hours of 
service rule issued by FMCSA last year will remain in effect?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I will say, if confirmed, I am certainly 
going to get into the Department and I know we had a very good 
discussion about the importance of the FMCSA's rules, and I 
know it will be one of my early priorities to look into, you 
know, the steps the Department is taking and see what happens 
next with that rule.
    Senator Fischer. OK, thank you. Also, the COVID-19 relief 
package that was passed in December included $2 billion in 
funding to support the private motorcoach school bus and small 
passenger vessel industries. If confirmed, will you make that a 
priority to provide the guidance and the allocations for this 
funding as soon as possible?
    Ms. Trottenberg. As we discussed, Senator, I agree. A very 
big priority. That industry has been so hard hit by the 
pandemic. And I know that the program that DOT is working with 
Treasury on, and if confirmed, certainly want to make that a 
priority.
    Senator Fischer. OK. Thank you. Also, I have worked with my 
colleagues and the Administration on ways to provide truck 
haulers of agricultural commodities, including livestock 
haulers, flexibility in meeting their hours of service 
requirements. In our conversation, I have told you that I 
brought this to the attention of now Secretary Buttigieg when 
we spoke privately about it. He said that he would, of course, 
look into it and work with us on it to be able to really 
address a unique challenge that agriculture producers have when 
they are transporting their goods. Will you commit to me that 
you will work with me and also the stakeholders, our Ag 
producers, our livestock haulers to provide them with 
appropriate hours of service flexibility?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I commit to work with you, Senator. And 
your Senator across the aisle, Senator Tester also certainly 
brought that issue to my attention.
    Senator Fischer. Great. Yes. I have a bill which I spoke to 
you about, the HAULS Act, so I hope you will look that over and 
we will be able to work together. Thank you. Also, Senator 
Duckworth and I, as Chair and Ranking Member of the 
Subcommittee, we were able to get a bipartisan PIPES Act that 
was passed. It took a long time to get that done. A lot of hard 
work on it. There are a number of provisions in that bill that 
would enhance the safety provisions that we have for pipelines. 
It ensures that PHMSA is going to have a well-trained staff and 
the resources that it needs, among other things. If confirmed, 
will you ensure that PHMSA implements the provisions of that 
Act and make it consistent with PHMSA's safety mission?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I will, Senator. Thank you for your 
leadership on that legislation. I know it has been very well 
received and the agency is already underway in its efforts.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you. In January, NHTSA issued a 
final rule updating certain definitions in vehicle 
crashworthiness standards to account for automated and 
passenger-less vehicles. NHTSA said this is part of a series of 
actions it is taking to modernize Federal vehicle standards for 
new technologies. Have you had a chance to look at that final 
rule? And if so, what are your thoughts on that?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I am familiar with it, Senator, but I have 
to say I would like to, for that one if confirmed, I want to 
get into the building and really talk to the experts and make 
sure I have a deep understanding.
    Senator Fischer. You know, we are looking at a variety of 
modes of transportation, and you will be in your new position 
as well, that when we apply all of the new technologies that 
are out there as well, it is going to take really some serious 
study of the current frameworks that we have and what is going 
to be needed in future frameworks.
    So I wish you all the best, if you are confirmed, to be 
able to really dig into the exciting technology that is 
available, but also to recognize the need that we have for more 
traditional modes of transportation to really address the 
diversity that we have in this country with states that deal 
with vastness and also with more urban and congested areas.
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you. I agree with you. There are a 
lot of very exciting safety developments on the horizon and 
obviously safety is going to be a big focus and priority for 
the Department.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you very much. I appreciate you 
being here today. Senator Blumenthal, you are next for 
questions.

             STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT

    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you, Senator. And I want to thank 
Ms. Trottenberg, for your continued commitment to public 
service. Welcome back to the Senate. I know you spent a lot of 
years here, maybe the most number of years of any place in your 
career, so you are no stranger to this forum. And I want to 
ask, first of all, about the Gateway project and about the 
tunnel under the Hudson. You and I have talked about it a bit 
privately. I would like to know how big a priority you think 
this project should be, because clearly, in my view, without 
the Gateway project our rail and possibly the other 
transportation systems will collapse on the East Coast.
    As much of an exaggeration as it may seem to say it that 
way, it is literally true that the tunnel is decaying and 
increasingly decrepit. It poses a danger to transportation up 
and down the East Coast. It could literally cripple the 
transportation grid as we know it now. And yet there have been 
delays and foot dragging and finger pointing. I would like to 
know whether it will be a priority and what you view as 
necessary to cut through the obstacles that have plagued it so 
far?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you for that question, Senator. And 
yes, Gateway is going to be a priority. It is truly a project 
of national significance, and as you say, one that really would 
have just a massive rippling impact if we were to see those 
over one hundred year tunnels under the Hudson River for some 
reason need to be shut down.
    I know that the both the President and the Secretary have 
spoken about this project and that the Department is going to 
be hard at work and making sure that we are picking up the pace 
and expediting the environmental and the other approvals needed 
for this project, and working closely, I think, with the 
Congress as well to make sure we have a financing and funding 
scheme that can get the project done.
    Senator Blumenthal. The impact of this project on 
Connecticut and New York and New Jersey, literally all of our 
states, should bring us together and it should enlist the full 
commitment and energetic involvement of the Federal Government. 
What should Congress be doing?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I mean, I think, again, the 
Administration--I haven't been confirmed yet, I am not in the 
door, but my understanding is they are hard at work going 
through environmental and other approval processes and starting 
to talk to the project sponsors about what else might be 
needed, what kind of funding and financing might need to be in 
place, and that may be potentially a place where the 
Administration will be coming back to Congress for further 
discussion.
    Senator Blumenthal. I would like to ask you for a 
commitment that you will provide me, and whoever else is 
interested on this committee, with a report within a couple, 
four weeks of your being confirmed? I am very hopeful, indeed 
optimistic that you will be confirmed, and I would like to have 
a report from you on what the status is. What steps need to be 
taken. Because I think we are at the point now where we need to 
seize this moment.
    It is such an imperative for our transportation system. It 
is a test of our credibility as a Government whether we can get 
this done, whether infrastructure matters in a project that is 
at the core of our entire rail and transportation system for 
East Coast and indeed the nation, as you say. So will you 
commit to providing such a report?
    Ms. Trottenberg. If confirmed, I certainly will, Senator. 
And I agree. This is not a project that we can fail to 
complete. We are going to have to find a way to do Gateway.
    Senator Blumenthal. Let me ask you. On a broader note, I 
know that the Administration is committed to infrastructure. Do 
you envision innovative new ways to finance that infrastructure 
project? And if so, maybe you can allude to some of them.
    Ms. Trottenberg. I certainly think it has been a discussion 
here at the hearing today about how I think there is pretty 
bipartisan consensus, we need to find a way to invest more 
resources in transportation. And part of that is certainly, I 
think, looking at innovative financing, see if there are ways 
we can bring in private investment. I think the Department 
actually, we took some steps during the Obama Administration to 
try and make those credit programs more user friendly. I think 
the last Administration did as well.
    There is more work, clearly, that needs to be done there to 
make the programs user friendly, to make sure that the costs 
are low for potential applicants, to make sure we are tailoring 
them, that they really can help projects get off the ground and 
do it in a cost effective way. And I think there can be places 
where private sector innovation can play a greater role. 
Certainly something I am interested on working on if confirmed.
    Senator Blumenthal. Well, my time has expired. I appreciate 
your testimony today, and again, your commitment to 
transportation and public service. I look forward to working 
with you. Thank you very much.
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Blumenthal. Senator Cruz.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED CRUZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS

    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Senator Blumenthal. Ms. 
Trottenberg, welcome. Congratulations on your nomination. In 
your opening testimony, you mentioned that a focus of the Biden 
Department of Transportation will be to foster innovation and 
global competitiveness. I couldn't agree more with that 
objective. Innovation is pervasive in the transportation 
sector, from drones to autonomous vehicles to ride share apps 
to commercial space. I will say, however, that I am concerned 
that your record is inconsistent with that objective, and so I 
want to ask you a bit about that.
    One area where we have seen tremendous innovation is on 
demand vehicle for hire service, services like Uber and Lyft 
that have transformed Americans' access to transportation 
services. This is especially true for poor and minority 
communities where access to transportation has increased 
dramatically because of the availability of services like Uber 
and Lyft. However, these services almost immediately 
encountered hostile regulatory environments from big cities.
    And despite the fact that Uber first entered the New York 
City market in 2011 and Lyft entered in 2014, in 2019, New York 
City instituted a draconian crackdown on Uber and Lyft, which 
you published an Op-ed supporting while you were New York City 
Transportation Commissioner, limiting the number of vehicles 
that can operate at a particular time, mandating that drivers 
carry a passenger at least 69 percent of the time, while 
operating in Manhattan below 96th street.
    Why did you support draconian regulations on Uber and Lyft, 
and how is that consistent with promoting innovation in 
transportation?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thanks for the question, Senator. And I 
think, you know, I will speak to New York's experience. I think 
it has been true in other cities around the country, even 
around the world. You know, Uber and Lyft entered into New York 
and very quickly, dramatically changed the for-hire vehicle 
market, which admittedly had been very much a taxicab medallion 
kind of monopoly model.
    And Uber and Lyft came in and, you know, believe it or not, 
New York actually was a city that was both better able to 
regulate them, but also let them operate pretty liberally. Over 
the years, they grew to greatly outstrip the size of the taxi 
industry and they started to have impacts on the local streets, 
particularly congestion. And there is no question in New York. 
I think it became a, you know, sort of an issue of political 
controversy and a desire to see fewer vehicles on the streets, 
to see more people using mass transit, and so that was sort of 
New York City's approach.
    It is not a one size fits all, but in New York, that was 
where the I think the sort of the politics of Uber and Lyft 
wound up.
    Senator Cruz. So I am not sure the record is consistent 
with your description of allowing them to operate, I think you 
said quite liberally. The Deputy Mayor of Operations is quoted 
in a New York Daily News article, the title of the article is, 
``New York City to impose some of the world's toughest 
regulations on Uber and Lyft.'' And here is what the Deputy 
Mayor of Operations is quoted as saying, ``I think the 
regulations are very strict, considering that we are not 
allowing them to grow the industry.''
    We wanted to do the cap in 2015. That law, as you know, was 
later struck down by a New York State Supreme Court Judge who 
said ``there was no rational basis to calculate the time 
drivers spent looking for new passengers.'' How can this 
committee be confident in the regulatory approach you would 
take at the Department of Transportation on a Federal level 
given, to use the Deputy Mayor of Operations' term, ``the 
regulations on Uber and Lyft that were promulgated were very 
strict and focusing on not allowing them to grow the 
industry''?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Again, Senator, thanks for the question, 
and I think if you look at the record of Uber and Lyft, they 
did have a lot of growth in New York City, but there did come a 
time and again, not just out of the Mayor's Office, but our 
City Council as well, that there was a desire to see some 
limits on that growth. And I would note that I don't think that 
has prevented working with those companies on some innovative 
projects.
    For example, even as obviously we were having some 
disagreements on the for-hire vehicle side, New York City 
entered into a partnership with Lyft to grow our bike share 
program. Very innovative. We now have one of the largest and 
most successful bike share programs in the country. Lyft has 
been a terrific partner. We have expanded now throughout the 
four boroughs.
    So, you know, at any given time, I think a big city can 
have its different relationships with the technology companies, 
but we still found lots of opportunities to partner with that.
    Senator Cruz. So you described the previous means of public 
transportation in New York, the automobile as a monopoly style 
taxi medallion system. And New York's taxi medallion system is 
infamous for medallions costing hundreds of thousands of 
dollars and for a monopoly system, frankly, encouraging 
corruption, benefiting the rich and powerful, and strengthening 
the Government regulators at the expense of the little guy. You 
said you were concerned about congestion.
    Why is it that the regulatory effort wasn't targeting the 
monopoly style medallion system, but was instead going after 
small business owners, the individual who gets an Uber or Lyft, 
is out there making money for his or her family without a 
monopoly medallion gifted by the Government? Why did you target 
the small business owners in particular?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Well, I think it is a good question, 
Senator. Thank you. I think it is--you have to be a little 
careful to think about generalizing too much. There is a lot of 
overlap in the driving population for both medallion cabs and 
Uber and Lyft. A lot of drivers drive for both. There are 
certainly, you know, some sort of larger investors who own a 
lot of medallions, but a lot of drivers just individually own 
their own medallions. So it is a pretty diverse population of 
drivers.
    And, you know, look, I recognize New York City, I think had 
its own sort of forged its own path in dealing with these very 
new and growing technologies. But I think, you know, it did not 
mean that the city was unwilling. Again, as I mentioned, our 
partnership with Lyft on bikes, are not, you know, unwilling to 
work with these technology companies.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Senator Tester. Hey, thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate 
it. And, you know, I just want to point out to your staff that 
told me that I was going to be able to be the temporary Chair 
of this Committee, which would have been a very high honor for 
me. And I just want to thank your staff for that, but it is 
good to have you back. Ms. Trottenberg, thank you for being 
here. It is really important to, kind of, going off the 
questions of the previous questioner that we make sure that the 
regulation fits the communities.
    And when I go to New York City, I am also very concerned 
about congestion. We see more cars in a block than I see in a 
weekend in Montana. So I want to talk about that, because quite 
frankly I don't know that you will find a lot of Senators here 
that drove an 18 wheeler last week and is driving a Prius this 
week, OK. But the specific thing I want to talk to you about is 
rural America. We just got done talking about Manhattan. I want 
to talk about rural America. And we talked about this on the 
phone a little bit. The one-size-fits-all regulatory scheme.
    What might work in Manhattan, New York doesn't work very 
well in Manhattan, Montana, OK. And so I would just ask you 
that as you are working on an incredibly important issue called 
transportation in this country, that is amazingly important, I 
don't care where you live, it is critical to quality of life 
and community and to the economy that when we start doing 
things in rural areas, just pick up the phone and give me a 
shout, OK?
    And when we start doing things particularly with the large 
land based tribes in this country, that you just pick up the 
phone and give me a shout. I would just like you to respond to 
that and talk about your leadership style when it comes to 
developing policy.
    Ms. Trottenberg. Yes. Thank you for that question, Senator 
Tester. And, you know, I do certainly want to pick up the phone 
and talk to you on rural matters and matters involving tribal 
Governments. It has been my leadership style to really try and 
work with stakeholders. I don't have all the answers. I value 
the chance to collaborate with colleagues and stakeholders all 
over the country. And, again, particularly recognize, you know, 
we have a big, diverse country.
    And certainly I know what flies in New York City is going 
to be something very different than the issues you might face 
in rural Montana. But I think there are some things we all care 
a lot about, having safe roads, making sure that our economy is 
functioning, that people can get to work and have good quality 
of life. I think there are a lot of things we can work on 
together.
    Senator Tester. I appreciate that. I want to talk about the 
Highway Trust Fund for a minute, not to put you on a spot on 
how to make it solvent, although that is going to be my 
question in the end. But rather to figure out what we are going 
to do to make this trust fund solvent. Right now, highways are 
really important. I have got a little highway that goes south 
of my house. Goes 20 miles. It has been--it started in the mid 
60s and was finished in the mid 70s.
    It has literally saved me tens of thousands of dollars over 
the last 43 years that I have been on the farm and saved my 
folks money before that. My parents not so lucky because that 
infrastructure--my grandparents not so lucky because that 
infrastructure wasn't there. But the question I have for you is 
that was built due much in part to the Highway Trust Fund. And 
now the Highway Trust Fund is a couple of years away from going 
broke, and I may be generous when I say that.
    And when I look around, I do see more and more cars being 
run off electricity, which I think is a very, very good thing. 
So the question is, as we try to make the Highway Trust Fund 
solvent, how do we do that? Is it going to be a hybrid of gas 
tax and taxes on--I mean, it has got to be paid for something 
so we will call them taxes? We can call them something else if 
we want to in another time. But maybe tires or miles traveled, 
which would put a few red flags up for me, being from a state 
where it takes me, you know, 70 miles to get to the place I 
market my wheat. But just give me an idea.
    Ms. Trottenberg. I mean, Senator, you, of course, raised 
something that is now been a big challenge really for the past 
few decades and in the past 10 years, you were sort of speaking 
about when the Highway Trust Fund becomes insolvent. For the 
past 10 years, Congress has been transferring general funds in 
to sort of make up some of the shortfall in the Highway Trust 
Fund.
    So it has been a very long standing problem. And I said to 
some of your colleagues before you arrived, I have not been 
confirmed yet and not able to speak to exactly what the 
Administration might propose. As you mentioned, I think there 
have been a lot of good ideas on the table over the years, but 
it has proved--you know, finding political consensus has proved 
elusive. I know President Biden and the Secretary have spoken 
about, you know, their desire to make some really foundational 
investments in infrastructure. And have heard from your 
colleagues that they are expecting the Administration to bring 
some ideas to the table and potentially how we could pay for 
that in the near future.
    Senator Tester. That is--that is great. And I know when 
Buttigieg was in front of this committee a month or so ago, he 
talked about that a little bit. And I think that if we do get 
an infrastructure package out of the Administration and we are 
able to get it passed through Congress, I am certain that there 
will be significant dollars for highways in it. But moving 
forward, we certainly have to have a mechanism by which to 
maintain those highways, which is also very, very important. I 
want to thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you for being here, 
Ms. Trottenberg.
    The Chair. Thank you. And Senator Tester, we will 
definitely allow you to chair this committee many times and so 
appreciate your willingness to help stand by and certainly 
appreciate Senator Blumenthal filling in while we had to go 
vote on several other nominees. So I believe Senator Sullivan 
is next. Senator Rosen.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JACKY ROSEN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Rosen. Thank you, Madam Chair. Appreciate it. I 
hope, Senator Sullivan fixes his computer issues, if that is 
what it is. I appreciate you, Ms. Trottenberg, for being here, 
your willingness to serve, and I would like to just go right 
into it. Of course, in Nevada, we know members of this 
committee, Kyrsten Sinema and I will talk about the importance 
of expanding I-11. That is the number one infrastructure 
priority between Nevada and Arizona delegations. One of the few 
cities that don't have any interstate connecting are Phoenix 
and Las Vegas and parts beyond.
    And so Nevada has a booming population. We are one of the 
fastest growing states in America. We need to meet that highway 
infrastructure, that increased demand that we are seeing, and 
investments have to include that I-11 connecting Nevada, 
Arizona, U.S.-Mexico border runs through Phoenix all the way up 
to Reno and into Northern Nevada. So Secretary Buttigieg, he 
made a commitment to move on I-11.
    I would appreciate your commitment as well. And in addition 
to that, would you also commit to working to address congestion 
issues along the Interstate 15, which travels through Southern 
Nevada, connects to Utah and California through Nevada?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you, Senator. You have my commitment 
on those two projects. It is perhaps an interesting coincidence 
that the last vacation I got to take before COVID was a trip 
that started in Las Vegas and went to Sedona, Arizona, and then 
down to Phoenix. So I am certainly familiar with the highway 
issues there.
    Senator Rosen. And I can tell you that is a great drive and 
beautiful and I hope we all get a chance to start doing that 
again. And that leads me into my next question. Thank you. It 
is travel and tourism. And so travel and tourism related 
industries, well they just drive our job creation and economic 
growth across the country, but especially in Nevada where these 
kinds of industries are absolutely essential to our state's 
prosperity. During COVID-19, of course, the pandemic hit us 
particularly hard. We are top of the unemployment list. We are 
expected to be one of the last states to come back because of 
travel and tourism and we just have so much riding on that part 
of our economy.
    And so as Chair, I am so grateful. I am Chair of the 
Committee's new Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade and Export 
Promotion. I have the responsibility to lead the effort to 
rebuild these critical sectors for Nevadans and for the 
American people. So I would really love to work with you and 
the Department of Transportation toward this goal. In Nevada, 
we not only have a robust tourism along our Las Vegas Strip, 
but we have robust outdoor tourism. Like you said, you went to 
Sedona, Arizona. They have it in Arizona as well, Grand Canyon, 
Sedona.
    We have a wonderful recreation economy, and we need to be 
sure that we have COVID-19 safety protocols for people to 
explore our Great Basin National Park, many of our mountain 
ranges. I like to remind people that Nevada is the most 
mountainous state in the lower 48. And so our Outdoor Business 
Association, it really estimates outdoor recreation tourism in 
Nevada generates over $1.1 billion annually to our state and 
local revenue, responsible for nearly 90,000 jobs. We only have 
about 3 million people in Nevada, so that is a lot.
    And so I was hoping you would work with me to be sure that 
we move forward with infrastructure legislation, that we invest 
in COVID recovery that includes support for tourism. As Deputy 
Secretary, will you ensure that DOT prioritizes engaging on 
transportation issues that take into account the impact on our 
greater tourism economy?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you for that question, Senator. I 
got to also speak to your Ranking Member, Senator Scott, and 
would be very enthusiastic about assisting in the efforts to 
help, obviously, the tourism industry, which has been 
devastated by the pandemic. You mentioned Las Vegas and I spoke 
with him about Florida. And let me tell you, just coming from 
New York, of course, they are an enormous tourist industry and 
so many jobs lost and so much economic hardship. Very 
enthusiastic about joining you all in efforts to bring that 
industry back as we recover from the pandemic.
    Senator Rosen. I hope that there will be a lot of good 
bipartisan support because every state from the tip of Maine 
down to San Diego, up to Washington and back to Florida, 
everywhere in between, everyone has some form or fashion of 
tourism that their economies depend on, and we have to work 
hard on that. And working on that, thinking more for the 
future, we have an emerging transportation technology where 
Nevada is proud to be on the cutting edge of innovation, 
transportation technologies. We have hosted the only statewide 
FAA authorized drone test site. We participate in several 
autonomous vehicle and smart transportation pilot projects, and 
we are home to the Hyperloop One testbed.
    And so I can take these answers off the record. I see my 
time has expired. But I want to know how you can continue to 
help us encourage creativity and innovation in our 
transportation sector, like the Hyper-One Loop, like our drone 
programs, autonomous vehicles of vehicles, and who knows what 
is in our future. So we want to do that, and we want to see 
it--be sure that we attract underrepresented groups to 
participate in this type of innovation as well. And I will take 
my questions off the record for that. So thank you for being 
here today.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Rosen. Thank you so much. 
Senator Blackburn.

              STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE

    Senator Blackburn. Thank you so much, Madam Chair. And Ms. 
Trottenberg, thank you for your time on the phone this week. I 
want to tag right on to what Senator Rosen was saying about the 
drones and the domestic drone industry, because we are all very 
concerned about what is happening in China, what is happening 
with the standard setting as China is trying to really try to 
push with the setting of the standards. And recently we have 
had issues with the DJI.
    And I am certain that you are aware of the issues that have 
existed there. DJI present some serious cybersecurity risk 
because of their relationship with the Chinese Communist Party. 
So I would like to hear you elaborate just a little bit on 
this. Will you take steps, if you are confirmed, will you take 
steps to support the emerging domestic drone industry? And how 
will you guard against the influence from companies like DJI 
that have been closely linked with the communist Chinese?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you, Senator, for that question. And 
you know, look, I certainly know the drone industry growing has 
a lot of economic promise and familiar with some of the 
security issues that have been emerging and obviously want to 
make sure as we grow that industry here domestically that we 
are taking into account foreign competition and security 
issues. If confirmed, that is certainly an area, if I get to 
the Department, I want to dig into very quickly and really 
would welcome the opportunity to work with you on that.
    Senator Blackburn. And I think it is important to note for 
the record that the nature with which the Biden Administration 
has approached China, the friendliness, the hesitancy to hold 
them to account, is something that as we talk about drones and 
surveillance and cybersecurity risk, this is something that is 
bringing forward some questions.
    So we would want to continue conversations on that. You and 
I discussed motorcoaches. And for the record, I would like for 
you to just comment on that, making certain that the program 
that we discussed with the--with DOT and Treasury administering 
the funding for the motorcoaches, that you are going to 
remember that there are private motorcoaches that are--they 
have an impact on our tourism, on our entertainment, and they 
need to make certain that funding who gets to those private 
motorcoaches.
    And likewise, let me also highlight with you the motor 
carrier liability insurance issues. And we want to make certain 
that DOT will not circumvent Congress and mandate an increase 
through the regulatory process when it comes to the liability 
insurance for motorcoaches.
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you for those questions. And as we 
discussed Senator, I share your sense of urgency about the 
motor coach industry and if confirmed, really do want to work 
closely with Treasury and get those dollars out the door. That 
has been a very crucial industry. I know it has been in 
Nashville and parts of your state, up in New York as well, and 
all over the country. An important part of the--of the tourist 
industry and really suffering since the pandemic.
    As we discussed, they have seen their ridership plummet 
down to almost nothing. Certainly commit to work on that. And 
on the insurance issue, when I--if confirmed, need to get 
myself up to speed on and certainly would come back to you with 
what the Department is thinking on that front.
    Senator Blackburn. Yes, because they are--yes, let's 
continue the conversation on that and because we are concerned 
with those rates and we can discuss that further. Regulatory 
reforms is also something we touched on in our phone call and 
the importance of infrastructure, especially in our rural 
areas, and making certain that regulation is moved to a point 
that it can be more effective and more efficient for our local 
communities.
    Ms. Trottenberg. I mean, certainly one thing we have talked 
about at this hearing is having been a local official myself, 
admittedly of a big locality, really experiencing firsthand the 
challenge that you can have in dealing with through the 
regulatory burdens from the Federal level. And I know for 
smaller communities and rural communities, that can be 
especially challenging.
    It is an area that I certainly think we can do more to help 
local communities, and something, if confirmed, I really want 
to work on. I don't want excessive regulatory burdens to stand 
in the way of good projects. But of course, I always want to 
make sure we are prioritizing safety considerations and 
environmental considerations.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you. Yield back.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Blackburn. Senator Peters.

                STATEMENT OF HON. GARY PETERS, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN

    Senator Peters. Well, thank you, Madam Chair. And Ms. 
Trottenberg, it is wonderful to see you. Thank you for being 
here with us and congratulations on your nomination. And 
certainly want to thank you for your years of public service 
and your willingness to serve again in this capacity. It is 
certainly commendable. I want to start first by just thanking 
you. It is always a good way to start some questions, but I 
want to thank you for your commitment to me, and I know you 
made the commitment to Senator Thune as well, to work with us 
on legislation to provide a framework so that we can safely 
test and deploy autonomous vehicles.
    It is something Senator Thune and I have been working on in 
a bipartisan way, bringing folks together. Clearly to get that 
legislation through, which is essential, which I will mention 
and talk about in a moment, will require bipartisanship. And I 
am certainly grateful for the Administration's commitment and, 
if confirmed, your commitment to get that done. As we spoke 
earlier about this issue, and we agree that this is incredibly 
important technology from a safety perspective, given the fact 
that on our highways, unfortunately, we still lose close to 
40,000 people a year, we can do better. We know there are 
technologies that can provide solutions to that significant 
challenge.
    An autonomous vehicles is a way to get there. And so the 
quicker we can develop the technology, literally, the quicker 
we develop that technology, the more lives that are saved, 
which I know has been a commitment of yours throughout your 
career, but also from a competitive advantage. This represents 
the future of mobility, which means the future of the auto 
industry. And this technology is moving forward aggressively 
all over the world. If we are not the ones developing it here 
in the United States, I am confident we will see either Asian 
companies and economies or Europeans or others develop this 
technology, and we want to make sure it is made here.
    I have always had a commitment to American workers 
representing the great State of Michigan, and we want to make 
sure that technology is developed in the United States and 
American workers are building these vehicles and making sure 
the future of mobility rests with the technology that we have 
here in this country. But I have just a question for you, and 
this goes back in a different role prior to you sitting here 
and other positions that you have had. We worked together on 
Federal legislation related to AVs that we were working on at 
the time that would enable more of these AVs to be deployed and 
tested, but also understanding we wanted to protect the rights 
of cities, the City of New York City where you were 
representing at the time.
    And we did with the notion that we wanted to make sure that 
cities wouldn't have to rely entirely on the regulatory piece 
of NHTSA or just the will of a State legislature or a Governor, 
but that they would be at the table to be able to make sure 
that they had a constructive role to play.
    So my question to you is, I would just like to set the 
record straight for my colleagues, and may I have your 
acknowledgment that my office and this committee were 
responsive to your concerns on behalf of the City of New York, 
and we, in fact, did reach an agreement through those 
conversations?
    Ms. Trottenberg. We did, Senator. And I think we had a good 
back and forth. And I thank you for acknowledging it. In my 
role as representing New York City and speaking for some of the 
cities around the country, I think the cities feel like we can 
bring something to the table in developing AV technology.
    You know, local city transportation officials, we have a 
really good feeling for what is happening on our streets. And 
so we did want a seat at the table, but I think because we can 
add value to the process. And thank you, I think we did reach, 
you know, a good understanding of language that would work for 
us.
    Senator Peters. Right. And obviously, as we move forward 
with this legislation, we have to continue to build those kinds 
of coalitions to get everybody on board, particularly because 
of the importance of both from a safety perspective and our 
competitiveness, and the idea that these autonomous vehicles 
really represent the future of artificial intelligence and AI 
has a reach much broader than the auto industry and is critical 
importance for us in the country.
    Just briefly, in my remaining time, in order to drive that 
technology forward, plus other safety technologies, we need to 
have connected infrastructure so that vehicles are 
communicating with each other, infrastructures communicating 
with it. The last Administration, unfortunately, designated the 
lower 45 megahertz of the 5.9 spectrum, which was previously 
reserved for transportation, reserved for these types of 
applications to make vehicles safer, and they reallocated it to 
unlicensed use. And they went on to solicit comment to allocate 
even more of the spectrum.
    And I will be clear, this is a spectrum that can save 
people's lives. It is a safety feature versus perhaps allowing 
folks to download a movie quicker. I think in that kind of 
tradeoff, I would rather save lives and hope that the Biden 
Administration will continue to move in that direction, which I 
believe they will. And certainly I think the signal that was 
sent by then FCC Chairman Pai was inconsistent with where 
President Biden is and his commitment to build back better.
    So my question to you is, will you commit to working with 
the FCC to identify a path forward for spectrum within the 5.9 
band that protects transportation safety? It is absolutely 
critical we do that. Will you commit to work with me on that?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I will, Senator. And if confirmed, that 
has traditionally been an important area for the Deputy 
Secretary of the Department to show leadership and focus 
exactly on, you say, on those spectrum questions and making 
sure that we can use those new safety technologies. Incredibly 
important in the transportation sector.
    Senator Peters. Well, thank you.
    The Chair. Senator Sullivan. Do we have Senator Sullivan? I 
just want to make sure that we have other members who know that 
they can ask questions or not. So, Senator Warnock. Oh, great. 
Senator Sullivan. Thank you. Or we will give him a second if he 
needs to get situated here.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DAN SULLIVAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Sullivan. Madam Chair?
    The Chair. Yes. Senator Sullivan.
    Senator Sullivan. Yes, thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair, 
and Ms. Trottenberg, congratulations on your nomination. I 
think we are going to meet later today so I look forward to 
that. One thing that I always ask nominees, if confirmed, if 
you can get up to Alaska soon with me, with Senator Murkowski, 
Congressman Young, it is a very unique place. Have you ever 
been to Alaska? And the challenges that we have in my state are 
a little different than New York City, so it is good to get on 
the ground and see it.
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you, Senator. I have not actually 
had the pleasure of going to Alaska and certainly would welcome 
the chance to do so as soon as possible.
    Senator Sullivan. Good. Well, we have a huge list of unique 
challenges, one of which is, I always like to say we are a 
resource rich but infrastructure poor state. We have less roads 
than Rhode Island, paved roads, and we're 491 times the size of 
Rhode Island. I am sure we have a lot less roads in New York 
and yet we are, I don't know how much bigger but several times 
bigger than New York. So one of the challenges that we have 
with regard to building out infrastructure is permitting.
    And there was some executive orders that the Trump 
Administration put forward, one of which was a single Federal 
decisionmaking order. I think it was very welcomed by both 
Democrats and Republicans, because what it did, it didn't focus 
on cutting corners, it focused on streamlining, permitting for 
major infrastructure projects. You know, a lot of talk about 
big infrastructure. I think a lot of us certainly support that, 
but we have had situations in my state where it takes years, 
sometimes decades, to permit infrastructure projects.
    The Chair of this Committee, there was a, she might recall, 
there was a witness who testified a couple of years ago about 
the expansion of a new runway at SeaTac Airport. When I asked 
them how long it took to get the permits for that, mostly 
Federal permits, he said 15 years. 15 years, SeaTac expansion, 
runways. Can you give me a sense of your views on how we can 
address this? This is--we had a gold mine in Alaska, 20 years 
to permit. I mean, this is crazy. It is one of the reasons we 
are losing--you know, we have challenges addressing our 
economic competition with China. What is your view on the 
streamlining and permitting, not cutting corners, but to make 
it so we can build infrastructure with--in a timely manner?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thanks for that question, Senator, and I 
share your desire to do better on that front. And again, having 
been a local transportation official for a number of years and 
being responsible for delivering big projects, I know well the 
challenges of dealing with the Federal permitting process. And 
I think we can have a system, as you say, that doesn't cut 
corners, that doesn't skimp on considering environmental 
issues, that doesn't skimp on community participation and 
input, but that can be faster and more streamlined. And part of 
that, this is actually something we did start in the Obama 
Administration.
    And I agree that the previous administration, the Trump 
Administration also did work on this at the Federal level, 
making that process streamlined, accountable, so that you know 
where your project stands, which agency is looking at what and 
having, I think, sort of an ultimate point of contact to help 
get those projects over the finish line. It is an area I 
certainly think there is a lot more work to be done. A lot of 
ways we can do things better, and as you say, not cut corners 
in the process.
    Senator Sullivan. No, not cut corners. Do you agree with 
the idea of having a single, kind of, point-of-contact within 
the Federal Government? Look, I actually think it is positive 
coming from sometimes the State officials, city officials like 
New York City. You see the dysfunction at the Federal level on 
permitting. So what about this idea of like a single point of 
contact in terms of Federal permitting for big projects?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I think that would certainly be the ideal. 
And I know there are other countries, Canada comes to mind, 
where I think they are able to do more of that. I think 
something we need to work with you all on part of the 
complexities of the Federal permitting process is, you know, 
statutorily there are a variety of Federal, as you know 
Senator, there are a variety of different Federal agencies 
involved that have their own statutory mandates. But I 
certainly agree with you. I think this is an area where 
certainly local and State transportation officials all over the 
country would welcome the chance to try and make this process 
work better.
    Senator Sullivan. I want to talk to you really quickly 
about your oversight on aviation. A couple of things. This 
committee has had bipartisan support for essential air service. 
Can I get your commitment to continue to fund that important 
program, particularly for rural communities?
    Ms. Trottenberg. You have a commitment. I know the Biden 
Administration feels strongly that we want to make sure we keep 
that program robust.
    Senator Sullivan. And the FAA has been up to my state a 
number of times. We are again--over 82 percent of the 
communities in Alaska are not connected by roads. So you either 
have to get there by a river or a snow machine in the winter or 
aviation. And that is why essential air service is so critical. 
But the other thing, we lack the infrastructure in many of our 
airports that the vast majority of the communities in the lower 
48 would be shocked by.
    And for that reason, we have had--we typically have much 
higher accident rates than the rest of the country. Can I get 
your commitment to work with me and the FAA on bolstering the 
infrastructure and the safety that occurs in Alaska as it 
relates to aviation in a way that is on par with what the lower 
48 expects and gets and yet we don't have in my state?
    Ms. Trottenberg. You have my commitment on that, Senator. 
And I know you mentioned that at the Secretary's hearing and 
was very troubling to hear, you know, the safety challenges you 
have in the Alaska aviation sector. Certainly want to help work 
with you on that if confirmed.
    Senator Sullivan. Great, thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair, 
and I am going to submit some more questions for the record.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Sullivan. Senator Warnock.

              STATEMENT OF HON. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM GEORGIA

    Senator Warnock. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Trottenberg, 
according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
transportation sector generated about 28 percent of the 
greenhouse gases produced in 2018 and about 60 percent of that, 
those emissions were produced by family cars, SUVs, pickup 
trucks. Of course, President Biden has made a serious 
commitment to greening our transportation infrastructure as a 
top priority to meet his climate goals. That would include 
billions of dollars in Federal investments for a new generation 
of low carbon trucking, shipping, and aviation.
    And it also includes investments in clean electric vehicle 
charging infrastructure. Can you talk, Ms. Trottenberg, about 
the importance of that last piece and how you see it as a part 
of the larger climate goal? That is, the clean electric vehicle 
charging infrastructure, meeting the Administration's goals and 
what is needed to meet those goals?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you, Senator, for that question. And 
I think the President has had some big, bold goals on charging 
infrastructure, wanting to--he spoke about in his build back 
better plan, putting 500,000 new charging stations around the 
country. And doing those, I think, in all parts of the country. 
I have had experience with starting to put that electric 
charging infrastructure in at the local level in New York City.
    But also there is a lot we can do on our highway system 
throughout the country. I think it is an area where, you know, 
we can make the kind of investments that, as you say, will help 
make the transportation sector so much greener, reduce the 
carbon footprint, also produce new technologies and new 
investments in an area. I am very excited, if confirmed, to 
work with this committee on.
    Senator Warnock. Well, thank you so much. And related to 
that, we have a massive $2.6 billion electric vehicle battery 
plant that is under construction right now in Commerce, 
Georgia. This plant would produce car batteries to help 
accomplish President Biden's goals in increasing electric 
vehicles to fight carbon emissions and climate change. The cost 
of the plant again, $2.6 billion. It will produce or provide 
2,600 clean energy jobs in the short term, ultimately up to 
10,000 new clean energy jobs in Georgia.
    But an adverse ruling by the International Trade Commission 
threatens seriously the future of that project, whether it will 
happen at all. This would be one of the largest economic 
investment projects on this score in Georgia's history and a 
severe punch in the gut, if you will, for the folks who are 
counting on those jobs, not to mention President Biden's own 
goals. Can you--by law, President Biden has 60 days to review 
the ruling and could alter it or block it.
    If confirmed, will you ensure that the Department of 
Transportation will provide to President Biden an analysis of 
this ruling's effect on his green transportation goals as he 
makes the decision?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I will certainly commit to that Senator. 
And I know the Department is already aware of the issue with 
this plant and I think is starting to look into the issues.
    Senator Warnock. Thank you so much. This will be absolutely 
critical for the people of Georgia that we would lose 2,600 
clean energy jobs in the short term and 10,000 in the long 
term. It is difficult to overstate the importance of that, but 
also the facilitation of President Biden's own clean 
transportation goals. So thank you so much for that commitment 
and I look forward to working with you to come to a resolution.
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you, Senator.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Warnock. Senator Young.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. TODD YOUNG, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM INDIANA

    Senator Young. Thank you, Chairman. Ms. Trottenberg, 
President Biden recently issued an executive order on America's 
supply chains and called on the leadership of various agencies, 
including the Department of Transportation, to take action to 
further the Administration's goal of strengthening the 
resilience of America's supply chains. As you know, a strong 
domestic supply chain is essential for a competitive national 
economy, and the efficiency of the domestic supply chain is 
contingent upon the efficiency of our transportation networks.
    Given that more than 80 percent of U.S. communities rely 
exclusively on trucks for their freight transportation needs, 
Ms. Trottenberg, I am concerned about the trucking industry's 
growing driver shortage and its impact on the resiliency of our 
domestic supply chain. If confirmed, Ms. Trottenberg, will you 
commit to working with me to bolster the trucking workforce and 
stem the driver shortage to ensure that the trucking industry 
can continue to drive our domestic supply chain?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I will, Senator. Thanks for the question 
and couldn't agree with you more. I am actually coming from a 
city where we get over 90 percent of our goods via truck and 
certainly recognize what an absolutely crucial industry that 
is. We will work with you on the issues of not only drivers, 
but also retention. I know one of the challenges in the 
trucking industry now is drivers come in and get trained and it 
is often hard to retain them in the industry. So if confirmed, 
an area I had certainly like to work with you on.
    Senator Young. Fantastic. Well, I will just mention some 
legislation that Senator Tester and I have been working on for 
a period of time, it is the Drive Safe Act, and I would just 
flag that for your attention. And I think we provided what 
could be a very helpful piece of the overall solution there. In 
your testimony, Ms. Trottenberg, you also discussed the need to 
ensure our transportation system equitably serves all 
Americans.
    In my home state of Indiana, like many states represented 
on the Committee, out rural communities tend to find themselves 
at a competitive disadvantage in securing Federal support for 
infrastructure projects. Yet many of these same rural 
communities serve as vital transportation and manufacturing 
hubs that drive our Nation's economy. So everyone benefits from 
investment in these communities and their infrastructure. So, 
Ms. Trottenberg, what steps can the Department of 
Transportation take to leverage Federal dollars in more of our 
rural communities?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you for that question, Senator. And 
Senator, I will start, you know, for example, with both our 
discretionary grant programs and credit programs. I know that, 
you know, one of the challenges rural communities face and 
smaller communities face, it can be pretty daunting to compete 
and apply for those programs. And I know something we tried to 
do in the Obama Administration, I know the Trump Administration 
as well, is to make sure that the Department is available and 
accessible to help those smaller communities.
    I know the Trump Administration has created a whole toolkit 
for their youth to make sure that we sort of demystify the 
process of getting Federal dollars, of being on the ground to 
provide technical assistance before communities apply for those 
funds so that they can understand, you know, what the 
challenges are and the pitfalls and what the Department is 
looking for. And then, you know, if they compete and don't win 
in a particular round, that the team is there to debrief them 
and help them figure out how to do better.
    So that is important for rural communities. I also know 
that that can be an issue for tribal Governments as well. And 
we want to make sure if Congress is providing the Department 
with these dollars, that we are making sure that those dollars 
are getting to communities large and small.
    Senator Young. I am really encouraged to hear that. 
Consider me a partner of the Administration's to the extent you 
are working on optimizing the application for these programs 
and helping communities reapply perhaps for a grant or loans 
that they didn't originally receive. Last, Ms. Trottenberg, I 
would like to pivot to what I will call red tape. We need to 
ensure our taxpayer dollars are used efficiently. It is 
important that the Department of Transportation focuses on the 
regulatory red tape that delays projects and raises costs.
    As we look to boost our economy and improve our 
infrastructure, we need to ensure that Federal Departments and 
agencies modernize their rulemaking process. How will you 
reevaluate DOT's rulemaking process to ensure that red tape 
doesn't create undue administrative delay or raise costs?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thanks for that question, Senator. And I 
know your colleague--the Secretary spoke about this issue at 
his confirmation hearing and promised to take a fresh eye in 
looking at the regulatory process. And I will agree, I 
certainly know from my time at U.S. DOT, it is a process that 
has grown up under many decades. And look, it is important for 
the Department to use that process to achieve its important 
priorities, particularly safety and consumer protection and 
environmental protection. But I also agree that it is a very 
complex process.
    And again, speaking as a local official, when you are 
trying to navigate your way through that regulatory system, it 
can be very challenging. I think there are ways we can--we have 
had this discussion with your colleague, Senator Sullivan, 
where we cannot cut corners, but we can find ways to make that 
an easier and a more modern process. I think there are 
certainly some things we can do to modernize it. And if 
confirmed, it is certainly an area I intend to focus on.
    Senator Young. I look forward to working with you on that. 
Congrats on your nomination.
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you so much, Senator.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Young. Senator Hickenlooper.

             STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN HICKENLOOPER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you so much, Madam Chair. And 
Ms. Trottenberg, I appreciate your public service in the past 
and going forward. I wanted to bring up and ask you to kind of 
illuminate, because I do remember when we were--you know, 
Colorado is not a coastal state. Oftentimes in the past, we 
were, you know, we were not the highest priority for the 
Department of Transportation in many cases.
    And when we did our, not just our large project, fast 
tracks in Denver, but actually across the state while I was 
Governor, I thought it was remarkable the way DOT was to 
address a lot of what Senator Young just referred to it, making 
sure that the smaller communities in non-coastal states got the 
attention they deserved. And I thought you would particularly 
put a lot of effort into that. I want to make sure that you got 
a chance to talk about that for a moment.
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you, Senator. And it is something I 
really believe in. I mean, I do believe the Federal Government 
is there to serve all communities and recognize, particularly 
for smaller communities, it can be very daunting to interact 
with a big Federal agency. I would just say for the record, 
even coming from running a transportation agency in a big city, 
it can even be daunting for the big cities as well. So I think 
that is something any community large or small across this 
country has faced those challenges.
    I really do think, I know it is something that the 
President feels deeply, and I believe the Secretary does too, 
as he does come from a small city, not a rural community, but a 
small city. How can we be common sense and make sure that when 
communities come to us, we are helping them achieve their 
priorities? And I like to think of myself as someone who is 
there to be a problem solver. Certainly, that is how I viewed 
my role often in New York, where, you know, big projects don't 
happen without a lot of just practical problem solving.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Well, as someone who has done a lot 
of big projects with the Department of Transportation, you are 
exactly right. Problem solving is what is needed more often 
than anything else. And again, I thought while you were there, 
you did a remarkable job of hearing all sides of a disagreement 
and making sure that the problems that were brought to light 
got solved quickly, efficiently, and fairly. I want to ask you 
a moment about DBEs, disadvantaged business enterprises.
    And I know that this has been a focus when President Biden 
was campaigning, how do we make sure some of these large FAA 
contracts and other DOT contracts get out there in a way that 
does help those small business and historically women owned, 
minority owned businesses. Are you--something you are going to 
be willing to make a strong commitment behind?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Absolutely. And I am excited to say, and I 
know you have heard it from the from the Secretary and 
certainly the President himself, what an important focus of 
priority this is as we spend Federal dollars that making sure 
that those businesses, which traditionally have not benefited 
as they should from those Federal investments, have the 
opportunity to compete.
    And I am happy to say I know, not confirmed yet, but I know 
at the Department they have really been building up and 
standing up a very robust civil rights division that is going 
to have a big focus on this. And certainly it is an area that I 
intend to focus on, if confirmed. So important that we give 
those businesses an opportunity to compete, and we and we share 
the wealth of these Federal investments.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right, absolutely. In Colorado, we 
have a strong commercial and aerospace industry and are looking 
eagerly forward to commercial space flights. And I know that 
you have spoken on this a number of times and the President 
spoke on it as well.
    Are you comfortable, and I know there is a lot of work to 
be done, that we can make sure the FAA does sufficient 
streamlining so that our commercial space, private sector 
businesses can compete globally because it is going to be a 
global effort and it is going to push the Department of 
Transportation in ways that I think, well, in many ways it 
hasn't been pushed before?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Yes, thanks for that question. I think 
that is right. Look, it is obviously now a new sector that has 
tremendous economic promise. And I recognize it is exciting in 
your state of Colorado and exciting in other places around the 
country that we make sure we have U.S. leadership.
    But, of course, I think from the Department's point of 
view, safety of the airspace is going to be the top 
consideration. I think this is something new for the FAA to be 
working through, but certainly I know just you know, from my 
conversations with officials, there is something that they are 
excited about and that the Department is excited about as well, 
and something I know we can work together on so that we can 
have, you know, the exciting growth of this industry, but make 
sure obviously we are doing in a way that makes sure that our 
airspace is safe.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Perfect. Just couldn't ask for better 
said than that. One last question quickly because I am out of 
time, I did want to just--I think autonomous vehicles have the 
potential to make our highways dramatically safer. What do you 
see as some of the largest obstacles that we are going to face 
as we begin to evolve and move toward autonomous vehicles?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Good question, Senator. What I have been 
having here, discussion also with your colleagues, Senator 
Peters and Senator Thune. I think we need to achieve some 
consensus on what a national framework looks like that helps 
provide some consistency in a testing and deployment regime. I 
think we need to make sure, obviously, that safety is paramount 
and that all the stakeholders have a seat at the table.
    It is going to be, you know, if done well, I do think 
revolutionary in terms of safety and in job creation and 
creating a whole new industry. And Senator Peters spoke so 
eloquently about what that would mean in his state. But 
clearly, we have a Federal role in bringing the parties 
together and trying to have, you know, some universal 
regulatory schemes around it. And we have all the right 
stakeholders at the table.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Hickenlooper. Senator Lummis.

               STATEMENT OF HON. CYNTHIA LUMMIS, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING

    Senator Lummis. Thank you, Madam Chair. I am so pleased to 
have the opportunity to visit with you, Ms. Trottenberg. I 
looked at your record and it is obvious that you have extensive 
experience in urban transportation matters. But I represent a 
rural state, Wyoming, and our transportation needs are vastly 
different from those of the Northeast. So what experiences have 
you had dealing with rural transportation issues?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Senator, thank you for the question. And, 
you know, prior to my time at New York City DOT, I was for 5 
years an official at U.S. DOT and got involved in 
transportation projects all around the country, large and 
small, including some in the beautiful state of Wyoming, and 
also spent many years here on Capitol Hill and was involved in 
several of the transportation bills that really tried to bring 
together, I think, the interests of all parts of the country, 
cities, rural areas, small towns.
    I have had a lot of experience working on the surface 
transportation, roadway side issues all over the country, as 
well as aviation issues, which you have issues at large 
airports, but I know also very important issues in terms of 
making sure that you have robust rural service as well.
    Senator Lummis. Well, thank you. I am going to follow on 
that line of discussion because highways, surface 
transportation is the most important transportation opportunity 
in corridors in Wyoming. Roughly, I think 93 percent of those 
funds is distributed by the current highway funding formula. I 
will tell you that my state of Wyoming generally is very 
pleased with the current highway funding formula.
    It provides adequate flexibility within various categories 
for them to plan 5 years down the road and then some, as you 
know, is necessary. So my question is, do you believe the 
current highway funding formula provides the kind of parity 
between urban and rural areas that is ideal or at least can be 
retained by the incoming Administration at DOT?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I certainly think, Senator, the surface 
transportation program has over the years served the country 
well. I think it has been a compromise in terms of urban and 
rural, highways and transit. I know the Biden Administration is 
and I am not--I haven't been confirmed, but I know they are 
starting to look at what their priorities will be for 
reauthorization.
    I certainly know that the President and the Secretary want 
to make sure that when we are investing in surface 
transportation, that we are doing it in a way that serves all 
parts of the country and that there will be a focus on rural 
areas.
    Senator Lummis. Well, we will want to continue to work with 
you as those discussions emerge, and I also want to visit just 
briefly about the other 7 percent that is not distributed by 
the funding formula and that is the discretionary grant 
programs. Will you commit to review the discretionary grant 
programs to ensure that urban and rural areas have the 
opportunity to participate in parity within the eligible 
criteria?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I will, Senator. And one thing I was just 
speaking to your colleagues about, also making sure that the 
Department is being as helpful as it can be to communities 
large and small, urban and rural, tribal Governments as well, 
to help compete for those programs. That you can get the 
technical assistance that you need ahead of time to understand 
the requirements and the pitfalls.
    And to the extent that you have an application that isn't 
successful, that the Department works with you afterwards to 
understand what you could do better to help a given community 
or transportation agency compete successfully.
    Senator Lummis. That sounds great. Thank you. One last 
question, what efforts is DOT taking to identify the reasons 
behind cost increases and project overruns, and then to 
mitigate those costs and those issues?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I mean, it is something I think the 
Secretary spoke about. And I will echo his words and add my 
own. You know, he made a point of saying, you know, the 
Administration, and shared with Congress, has a lot of 
important transportation goals. But we also do have to make 
sure that we are doing things as efficiently as we can.
    And again, as someone who has run a local transportation 
agency, you feel that pressure to deliver your projects on time 
and on budget, and you are always looking for ways that you can 
be smarter and more efficient. I think there is a lot we can do 
in our transportation system to make those, you know, those 
very vital transportation dollars go further. An area, if 
confirmed, would certainly welcome the opportunity to work with 
Members of Congress on.
    Senator Lummis. And we with you, Ms. Trottenberg. I 
supported the nomination of the Secretary and look forward to 
working with him and with you going forward. So thank you very 
much. Ms. Chair, I yield back.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Lummis. Next, we have Senator 
Klobuchar.

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. Well, thank you very much, Chairwoman 
Cantwell. And thank you for your patience with this large 
committee, Ms. Trottenberg. I am very excited, as I told you 
when we talked, about your nomination. And I am just really 
excited because of your experience that I think is going to be 
so important. And we had a great hearing with Secretary 
Buttigieg.
    We think he is going to be a wonderful Secretary. So 
congratulations. I just wanted to start out with the poor 
conditions of our roads in Minnesota. No surprise. There is a 
lot of roads. We are home to a major rural area, and we are 
also home to many, many major companies. So we do a lot of 
freight transport as well as rail transport, as well as 
actually a barge transport.
    And could you talk about some of your ideas to reduce 
congestion on our roads? I think we have seen that right now 
during the pandemic, obviously, a little less use of those 
roads, but overall costs drivers nearly $1,600 a year and 
highway congestion adds nearly $75 billion each year to the 
cost of freight transport.
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you for that question, Senator. And 
you are right, certainly during the pandemic we saw in New York 
and all around the country congestion plummet. But I would say 
in a lot of places, driving levels are pretty much back to 
where they were. You know, public transit ridership, not so 
much, but people have gone back to the roadways. And obviously, 
you know, it has particularly become important during the 
pandemic to make sure that our freight networks can deliver 
goods. We have been so dependent on them during this 
challenging time. I think I am going to say for improving the 
movement of goods and tackling congestion, it is not a one-
size-fits-all challenge.
    I think we are going to need a lot of different solutions. 
We have been talking today in the Committee about some of the 
things we have done in New York. I certainly know looking at 
Chair Cantwell, a piece of that puzzle is going to be robust 
investments in mass transit as a way to give people 
alternatives to driving and making sure that our roadway 
infrastructure is in good condition. You know, I think we 
certainly saw in New York some chunk of what we see in terms of 
congestion is incidents happening on the roadway. Unexpected 
incidents can often be----
    Senator Klobuchar. And also--sorry, not to interrupt here, 
but I guess I did. The other piece of this in addition to light 
rail and that kind of transit, I think one of the things that 
is very important is rapid buses for the suburbs in Minnesota. 
We have developed a major rapid bus network. Could you comment 
on that?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I certainly will. It is something we also 
did some work on in New York. It is, I think, a terrific way to 
invest in mass transit. It can be done a lot more nimbly and 
at, you know, a lot less of a cost than building a whole light 
rail line or subway line. And it is proving, I think, a very 
effective way to move people around. And as we move into an era 
of using electric buses, it is going to be a very green way to 
move people around as well.
    Senator Klobuchar. One of the things that I am very focused 
on is distracted driving. Could you talk about that? I know 
Secretary LaHood thinks a lot about you. He was such a leader 
on this issue, and I hope you will be too.
    Ms. Trottenberg. I will be, yes. I had the privilege of 
serving under Secretary LaHood and he made that a big focus in 
the Department. And I think an area where we really raised 
public awareness. And, you know, through his--through his 
efforts and his bully pulpit, I think did a lot to help bring 
some, you know, some awareness of that issue and make our 
roadways safer. I am very committed to the cause of roadway 
safety. And, you know, I want to continue those efforts on 
distracted driving, on impaired driving, and a lot of other 
areas of roadway safety.
    Senator Klobuchar. Here is something I am not certain we 
discussed when we talked, but our reports have found that one 
in six vehicles used to transport Uber and Lyft passengers has 
at least one open recall, and neither app alerts passengers 
that this is the case.
    Last week, I introduced the Safe Ride Act to require the 
GAO in working with NHTSA to conduct a comprehensive study on 
the Uber and Lyft vehicles with open safety recalls and reports 
on ways to make recall notices more effective. How can you move 
quickly on this issue?
    Ms. Trottenberg. I am sorry, Senator. You cut out your 
little--.
    The Chair. I think she wants to know whether you would work 
with her on the recall issues?
    Ms. Trottenberg. Yes. Thank you, Senator. No, I was 
interested when you brought that issue to my attention. Happy 
to, if confirmed, dig in on that one and work with you.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK, very good. Well, again, 
congratulations. I have some aviation questions that I will put 
on the record, especially with some of our rural airports. And 
we talked about all the important projects in Minnesota, 
including the port up in Duluth to our roads in the rural 
areas, to all [technical problems] that is going on in the Twin 
Cities. So thank you very much for your service and I look 
forward to working with you.
    Ms. Trottenberg. Thank you, Senator.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. That is all the 
members that we have--that we believe want to ask questions. If 
anybody else knows of anything, anybody else who is there 
remotely that we don't know about, let us know. But otherwise, 
again, congratulations on your nomination. Thank you for your 
willingness to serve. Thank your family for the willingness to 
help make sacrifices so she can help with our transportation 
infrastructure.
    As you can see from the broad questioning that people have 
today, that it is a little bit of what we went with Secretary 
Buttigieg that here and now of COVID and the tomorrow of 
automating our system with more technology and obviously with 
other new investments that are going to help us and reducing 
fossil fuels. So you got the gamut. So, busy job. We so 
appreciate your willingness to do it.
    The hearing will remain open for two weeks until March 17, 
2021. Any Senators who would like to submit questions for the 
record, please do so for Ms. Trottenberg by March 10. And then 
we ask your responses to be in to the Committee by March 17. 
So, if we have no other members who would like to ask a 
question, that concludes our hearing for today.
    [Whereupon, at 12:11 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

                            A P P E N D I X

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell to 
                          Polly E. Trottenberg
    Multimodal Freight Investment. In 2018, the Nation's transportation 
system moved about $51.8 billion each day. By the end of the decade the 
value of freight transported is expected to increase by 40 percent to 
over $70 billion shipped each day. Multimodal freight accounts for 22 
percent of the $645 billion in goods transported through Washington 
state. However, Federal freight funding programs put a 10 percent cap 
on multimodal funding.

    Question 1. Do you think that the multimodal cap on the 
Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) grant program and the 
National Highway Freight formula program should be eliminated so that 
the most economically significant freight projects can be funded 
regardless of mode?
    Answer. I believe the Department plays an important role in 
ensuring the U.S. has a freight transportation system which supports 
job creation, economic growth and global competitiveness, using all the 
Department's authorities, including discretionary grant programs like 
INFRA. I commit to working with Congress to support a multimodal 
freight program that achieves National economic and sustainability 
goals.

    Question 2. Many freight stakeholders find the U.S. Department of 
Transportation's (DOT) siloed approach to freight policy to be 
frustrating. Without a specific office or element within DOT focused on 
freight, it has taken DOT far too long to enact freight-related 
provisions from the FAST Act--particularly establishment of the 
national multimodal network which is still outstanding. Would a 
multimodal freight office within the Office of the Secretary make 
national freight planning more effective and coordinated across the 
Department and ensure that freight activities receive the attention 
they need?
    Answer. With regard to freight policy within the Department, my 
understanding is that there is already considerable collaboration and 
coordination of freight-related policy and program activities among the 
Office of the Secretary and the modal administrations. If confirmed, I 
will assess this level of collaboration and coordination and commit to 
working with Congress to ensure that the Department takes a holistic 
and multimodal approach to strengthening our Nation's freight system as 
we support the President's vision for a strong economy.

    Amtrak Long-Distance Routes. The Trump Administration repeatedly 
proposed cuts to Amtrak's long-distance routes. This transportation 
network provides essential transportation services to many rural 
Americans that have few other public transportation options. 
Additionally, the Federal investment in the long-distance routes has a 
significant economic impact. According to the Rail Passengers 
Association, the long-distance Empire Builder route, which runs from 
Chicago to Seattle and Portland, contributes $327 million to the 
economies of the states it serves.

    Question 3. Will you commit to working to protect the viability of 
Amtrak's long-distance routes?
    Answer. In recent years, Amtrak had made impressive progress in 
improving its fiscal and operational health and in providing stable 
daily service on its long-distance routes, which serve as vital 
lifelines in so many rural communities across the U.S. Unfortunately, 
Amtrak has been hard hit by COVID-19, and if confirmed, I look forward 
to working with Congress to establish predictable, dedicated funding 
sources for Amtrak maintenance and expansion. I also commit to working 
with Secretary Buttigieg to help Amtrak return to financial stability 
and pre-pandemic service levels throughout the country.

    Question 4. Will you work with Amtrak and the freight railroads to 
ensure that Amtrak trains on the national network run reliably and 
improve on-time performance?
    Answer. I am committed to improving passenger rail and, if 
confirmed, look forward to working with you and your colleagues on this 
Committee to establish increased passenger rail service that runs 
reliably and on-time. It is very important to find the optimal and most 
efficient balance between moving people and freight around the country. 
I believe DOT plays a role working with safety and other stakeholders 
in determining that balance.

    Texas Pipelines. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration (PHMSA) faces a number of statutory limitations on its 
regulatory authority. However, the recent freezing of the natural gas 
infrastructure in Texas raises concerns about the lack of regulation 
over infrastructure that people rely on for basic necessities, such as 
heat during the winter.

    Question 5. If confirmed, will you review PHMSA's statutory 
authorities and provide any suggestions for improving PHMSA's authority 
over the reliable and safe operation of natural gas pipelines.
    Answer. If confirmed, I will certainly review PHMSA's statutory 
authorities and work with the Administration and Congress to offer 
suggestions for improving PHMSA's authority over the reliable and safe 
operation of natural gas pipelines.

    Passenger Rail Safety. Ensuring passenger rail safety must be a top 
priority of the Department of Transportation. In 2017, Amtrak train 501 
derailed in DuPont, WA, on the inaugural run of a new route when the 
train went around a curve 50 miles per hour over the posted speed 
limit. As a result of the derailment, three people died and over 60 
people were injured. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
found several failures that contributed to the incident including poor 
crew training, safety planning, and regulatory oversight.

    Question 6. If confirmed, will you review the NTSB's report on the 
DuPont derailment and work to ensure the Board's recommendations are 
implemented by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and Amtrak?
    Answer. The work NTSB does to investigate incidents and crashes to 
better understand what happened is an important means to advance 
transportation safety. If confirmed, I commit to working with NTSB, 
Amtrak, and the relevant program offices at the Department to address 
outstanding recommendations.

    Crude-by-Rail Safety. In December 2020, a mile-long train carrying 
heavy crude oil derailed at a railroad crossing in Custer, WA. Ten tank 
cars derailed and five cars caught fire resulting in the spillage of 
30,000 gallons of oil despite using retrofitted DOT-117 tank cars. This 
incident forced families half a mile away to evacuate for their own 
safety. Thankfully, no one was injured, however it was a stark reminder 
of the hazards posed by these trains.

    Question 7. If the FRA's review of the Custer incident indicates 
potential issues with the retrofitted DOT-117 tank cars, will you 
commit to conducting a comprehensive review of tank car standards and 
work with my office to identify improvements that may be needed to 
ensure tank car safety when transporting hazardous materials?
    Answer. My understanding is the Custer incident is still under 
investigation. If confirmed, I look forward to studying the 
investigation's findings once it has concluded. I share Secretary 
Buttigieg's commitment that safety is a top priority at the Department. 
I commit to working with the Secretary and the Committee to increase 
the safety posture across DOT and the transportation system.

    Question 8. Will you review current PHMSA regulations pertaining to 
the safe transportation of light and heavy crude oil to help prevent 
future dangerous incidents from occurring?
    Answer. If confirmed, I will certainly review current PHMSA 
regulations pertaining to the safe transportation of light and heavy 
crude oil to help prevent future dangerous incidents from occurring.

    Disadvantaged Business Enterprises. The Department of 
Transportation's Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program is 
designed to ensure businesses owned and controlled by socially and 
economically disadvantaged individuals have a fair opportunity to 
compete for federally funded transportation contracts. Although the 
program applies to transit and highway funds, the FRA does not 
currently have specific statutory authority for a DBE program. Section 
11310 of the FAST Act of 2015 required DOT to conduct a nationwide 
disparity study on the availability and use of small business concerns 
owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals and veteran-owned small businesses in publicly funded 
intercity rail passenger transportation projects. A report to Congress 
on the study was due within two years.

    Question 8. Based on your experience at the New York City 
Department of Transportation, how can the DBE program be expanded and 
improved?
    Answer. The DBE program, which aims to increase participation of 
women-and minority-owned businesses in federally funded transportation 
projects, is an important tool for advancing economic opportunity and 
wealth creation for small business owners. In my experience, there are 
steps that can be taken to strengthen the DBE program at the Federal, 
state and local levels. At DOT, we need to lead by example by expanding 
opportunities for DBEs, tracking our progress, and proactively and 
creatively addressing barriers to DBE participation where they arise.
    DOT also needs to work closely with state and local recipients of 
Federal transportation funds to ensure they are setting appropriate DBE 
participation goals and ensure that DBEs can compete for those 
projects. At NYCDOT, we worked proactively to identify potential DBEs, 
worked with them to get certified, and helped them understand the 
requirements for bidding on contracts with New York City, and to make 
sure they were aware of upcoming contract solicitations. We also worked 
closely with prime construction contractors to connect them to DBEs for 
joint ventures and subcontracting opportunities.

    Question 9. Will you commit to expeditiously completing the 
disparity study required by the FAST Act and reporting your findings to 
Congress?
    Answer. Addressing racial inequity and fostering economic recovery 
for all Americans is a priority of the Biden-Harris Administration. If 
confirmed, I commit to expeditiously completing the disparity study 
required by the FAST Act and reporting the findings to Congress.

    Question 10. If you are confirmed, will you commit to meeting with 
DBE companies and representatives to learn about barriers they face and 
ideas they may have to improve the DBE program?
    Answer. As mentioned above, supporting economic recovery, 
especially by those hardest hit by the pandemic, such as small and 
disadvantaged businesses, is a critical pillar of the Biden-Harris 
Administration's Build Back Better vision. If confirmed, I will 
certainly meet with DBE companies and representatives to learn about 
and address barriers they face and ideas they may have to improve the 
DBE program.

    Contract Tower Program. I have long supported continued investment 
in the Federal Aviation Administration's contract tower program-which 
provides critical air traffic control safety benefits to 256 smaller 
airports across the country.

    Question 1. What are your plans to help ensure that small rural 
airports have the resources they need through this program?
    Answer. In the near term, if confirmed, I will work to ensure 
expedient administration of funds included in the American Rescue Plan 
Act. As you know, this legislation included another much needed round 
of funding for the Nation's airports. This funding will benefit large 
airports and small rural airports, including those that operate 
contract towers. Additionally, I understand the FAA is actively 
processing funding payments under the Coronavirus Response and Relief 
Supplemental Appropriation Act (P.L. 116-260), which included a set-
aside for non-primary airports that participate in the Federal Contract 
Tower program. In the long term, I will work with Secretary Buttigieg 
to pursue necessary funding for the Federal Contract Tower program as 
well as funding for those programs that are critical to ensuring the 
viability of small rural airports.

    Question 2. What are your plans to improve the contract tower 
program?
    Answer. I look forward to working with Secretary Buttigieg and the 
FAA as well as Members of this Committee on this issue. I understand 
there continues to be interest in ensuring the availability of 
experienced controllers at Contract Towers and if confirmed, I will 
work within the Department to ensure a continued commitment to the 
program's funding and administration. I will work with Congress to 
determine how best to address the challenges that may remain for the 
program.

    Aviation Safety. Aviation safety is a top priority for me. The Safe 
Skies Act, which I introduced last Congress with Senators Cantwell, 
Blumenthal, Markey, and Duckworth, would ensure that America's cargo 
plane pilots have the same rest requirements as passenger pilots. I 
plan to reintroduce this bill this Congress.

    Question 3. What are your plans to help reduce fatigue-related 
incidents for cargo pilots?
    Answer. When it comes to air travel, the safety of our aviators, 
crews and passengers is most important to me and to the Secretary. I 
would expect DOT to require and uphold a high level of safety standards 
for our aviators and crews whether they are flying cargo or passengers. 
I look forward to further exploring the issue with this Committee and 
the industry to maximize safe air travel for all participants.

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Edward Markey to 
                          Polly E. Trottenberg
    Approach to Motor Vehicle Safety. In 2019, over 36,000 people were 
killed in motor vehicle crashes. There were nearly 7 million police-
reported crashes and more than 2.7 million people were injured as well. 
Tragically, similar numbers repeat year after year, revealing a public 
health crisis in automotive and traffic safety. These deaths and 
injuries are not inevitable, however, and they can be addressed using 
proven strategies as well as the latest safety technologies.
    That's why I introduced a robust legislative package in the last 
Congress with four bills that will collectively address the threats of 
seatback failure (S.4122), distracted driving (S.4123), ineffective 
recalls (S.4121), and insufficient oversight of the auto industry 
(S.4120). I am now fighting to ensure that these bills become law as 
part of Congress's next big transportation legislation.

    Question 1. As our next Deputy Secretary of Transportation, will 
you support the inclusion of these four bills in a comprehensive 
infrastructure package? In addition, what specific safety actions will 
you recommend the DOT take that will result in significant and 
sustained reductions in the fatality and injury toll on our streets and 
highways?
    Answer. I strongly support your commitment to advancing motor 
vehicle safety and was proud to make Vision Zero one of my highest 
priorities as Commissioner of the New York City Department of 
Transportation. If confirmed, I look forward to working with the 
Administration and this Committee on legislative efforts to make U.S. 
roadways safer. We are losing far too many lives and seeing too many 
life-changing injuries in preventable crashes. There are a number of 
areas where DOT can advance roadway safety, through AV technology and 
better vehicle designs that protect occupants as well as vulnerable 
roadway users, improving driver behavior, and addressing vehicle 
recalls with low completion rates. DOT can also work closely with state 
and local transportation agencies to promote safer roadway designs and 
use research, grants, data collections, performance standards, and 
other activities to advance national roadway safety.

    Approach to Truck Safety. Fatal truck crashes continue to occur at 
an alarmingly high rate. In 2019, over 5,000 people were killed in 
crashes involving a large truck. Since 2009, the number of fatalities 
in large truck crashes has increased by 48 percent. Additionally, 
159,000 people were injured in crashes involving a large truck in 2019 
and injuries of large truck occupants increased by 18 percent.
    Last fall, an investigation by the Boston Globe detailed these 
disturbing trends and revealed how the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration (FMCSA) has repeatedly failed to provide proper 
oversight of American's commercial trucking industry. In response, I 
wrote a letter to the FMCSA that urged the agency to implement stronger 
procedures for certifying new trucking companies, conducting regular 
oversight of the industry, and enforcing Federal safety regulations.

    Question 2. If confirmed, will you commit to significantly 
strengthening Federal oversight of America's commercial trucking 
industry? In addition, what specific actions will you recommend the DOT 
take to stem the rise in truck crash deaths and injuries?
    Answer. Making sustained progress will require a comprehensive 
approach to focus on trucking safety. The numbers you cite are a vivid 
reminder of how many families lose loved ones, and how many lives are 
altered because of traffic crashes on our streets and highways. If 
confirmed, I will work with FMCSA to identify improvement opportunities 
to ensure the Department effectively oversees the safe operations of 
the commercial trucking industry using the most appropriate policy 
tools. This could include better identifying high risk new trucking 
companies, ensuring current regulations are judiciously enforced, 
expanding education and outreach, and harnessing new technologies that 
save lives.

    Backup GPS. GPS has become vitally important for our country, 
providing position, navigation, and timing (PNT) services that underlie 
our economy and national security. Unfortunately, this system is 
increasingly threatened by disruption, jamming, and possible outright 
attack by malicious actors, creating a potentially devastating single 
point of failure. To address these concerns, Congress passed and the 
President signed the National Timing Resilience and Security Act of 
2018 (NTRSA), which I sponsored. The law requires the Department of 
Transportation (DOT) to provide for the establishment, sustainment, and 
operation of a resilient backup timing signal for GPS, which will pave 
the way for a full backup system of PNT services.
    Although the prior administration issued an important and 
comprehensive evaluation of alternative PNT technologies in January 
2021, it failed to implement the NTRSA or provide a full backup timing 
signal by the statutory deadline of December 2020.

    Question 3. If confirmed, will you commit to executing the NTRSA as 
a priority for the Department to deploy the congressionally required 
timing signal, as well as build on the DOT's January 2021 report to 
help ensure we finally have a full backup system for PNT services 
across our critical infrastructure, society, and economy?
    Answer. Resilient positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) 
services are not only important to supporting critical infrastructure 
in the transportation sector, but also are essential for national, 
homeland, and economic security through the integration of millions of 
Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers into our everyday lives. Key 
PNT applications include those used for emergency response, 
transportation safety, precision agriculture, machine control for 
construction and mining, timing signals for telecommunications and 
financial transactions, high-precision instruments for local-area 
climatology studies, weather prediction, surveying, general navigation, 
and scientific applications.
    The transportation sector has some of the most stringent 
performance requirements in terms of PNT accuracy, integrity, 
availability, and reliability. If confirmed, I will continue to work 
with Congress, our Federal partners, and our stakeholders to implement 
GPS backup and complementary PNT technologies to deliver resilient PNT 
capabilities.

    Amtrak Southwest Chief and Sunset Limited. In my home state, the 
Southwest Chief provides service to Flagstaff, Kingman, and Winslow, 
Arizona. The Sunset Limited serves Tucson, Benson, Maricopa, and Yuma, 
Arizona. In these communities, Amtrak service is a significant 
financial driver. For example, over 50,000 riders disembark in 
Flagstaff each year and provide more than $12 million in tourism 
dollars to the city.
    The current service cuts to three times per week on long-distance 
routes, such as the Southwest Chief and the Sunset Limited, impacts 
both local workers and local economies.

    Question 1. Can you commit to supporting long-distance Amtrak 
service such as the Southwest Chief and the Sunset Limited?
    Answer. In recent years, Amtrak had made impressive progress in 
improving its fiscal and operational health and in providing stable 
daily service on its long-distance routes, which serve as vital 
lifelines in so many rural communities across the U.S. Unfortunately, 
Amtrak has been hard hit by COVID-19, and if confirmed, I look forward 
to working with Congress to establish predictable, dedicated funding 
sources for Amtrak maintenance and expansion. I also commit to working 
with Secretary Buttigieg to help Amtrak return to financial stability 
and pre-pandemic service levels throughout the country, including the 
Southwest Chief and Sunset Limited.

    Phoenix Amtrak Service. Phoenix is the fifth largest city in the 
United States and the largest city in the country not served by Amtrak 
passenger service. Arizona is also one of the fastest growing states in 
the country. Amtrak service to Phoenix ended in 1996, and the closest 
current Amtrak service to the Phoenix region is in Maricopa, about 
thirty-five miles south. At a September presentation to the Rail 
Passenger Association, Amtrak included Los Angeles--Palm Springs--
Phoenix--Tucson as an option for corridor expansion.

    Question 2. What factors would you consider when deliberating about 
future proposals to expand Amtrak service, such as returning service to 
Phoenix?
    Answer. The opportunity to expand intercity passenger rail in fast-
growing and underserved regions such as Arizona is one that I look 
forward to exploring further, if confirmed. I stand ready to work with 
you, as well as our partners at the state, local, Tribal, and 
territorial level, the private sector, and Amtrak to improve and expand 
our passenger rail system in order to advance these important goals.

    Contract Tower Program. The Contract Tower Program has a strong 
track record of enhancing aviation safety at more than 250 airports in 
the country including seven in Arizona. Phoenix Mesa-Gateway--one of 
the busiest contract towers in the country--is in the process of 
building a new tower that will help address complex airspace management 
challenges.

    Question 3. Can we count on the Department and the FAA to work with 
us to ensure contract towers will continue to play a critical role in 
our national air traffic control system?
    Answer. I look forward to working with Secretary Buttigieg and the 
FAA as well as Members of this Committee on this issue. I understand 
there continues to be interest in ensuring the availability of 
experienced controllers at Contract Towers and if confirmed, I will 
work within the Department to ensure a continued commitment to the 
program's funding and administration. I will work with Congress to 
determine how best to address the challenges that may remain for the 
program.

    Autonomous Vehicles. Automated driving system technology is rapidly 
evolving.

    Question 4. How will the Department ensure that its workforce has 
the appropriate expertise to develop and enforce rigorous safety 
standards for the continued development and eventual safe deployment of 
AV technologies?
    Answer. If confirmed, I am eager to work with you and your 
colleagues in Congress to ensure that the Federal government is leading 
the way on ensuring safe autonomous vehicle operations nationwide. I 
will work with our operating administrations to assess our capacity 
building programs, the DOT-funded University Transportation Centers, 
and partner with safety organizations, industry, and other stakeholders 
to make sure our workforce is prepared and advance deployment of safe 
AV technologies.

    Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). In the past year, we have seen UAS 
(or drones) provide significant benefits to society, particularly 
during the pandemic. Drones have provided contactless delivery of food, 
medicine and other essential items. They have helped small businesses 
reach customers, engineers evaluate bridge safety, insurance agents 
evaluate storm damage, and inspectors to review infrastructure. Drones 
have done this all while increasing safety and reducing environmental 
impacts.

    Question 5. If confirmed as Deputy Secretary of Transportation, 
will you prioritize advancing drones and ensure the regulatory 
framework in the United States keeps pace with evolving drone 
technology?
    Answer. The main priority of the FAA is aviation safety. When it 
comes to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), safety is not just about the 
aircraft itself, but how that aircraft can safely integrate into our 
shared airspace and ensure the safety and security of our communities. 
There are still many challenges, but we are very focused on encouraging 
the progress of clean aircraft technologies and job creation here in 
the U.S. I look forward to working with Congress and the FAA to help 
the Department solve the remaining safety barriers so UAS can become a 
vital part of a cleaner, robust, domestic economy.

    Interstate 11. A transportation priority for Arizona is I-11, which 
will run from the U.S./Mexican border to Phoenix, Las Vegas, and north 
through Nevada. Interstate 11 will be an important link between two of 
the largest cities in the county, will increase trade and commerce with 
Mexico and Canada throughout the region, and will relieve air pollution 
and congestion in downtown Phoenix.

    Question 6. Can you commit to reviewing this project and working 
with the Arizona and Nevada delegations to continue to advance this 
project?
    Answer. If I am confirmed, I commit to reviewing and working with 
the Arizona and Nevada delegations on this project.

    Hyperloop. Hyperloop is a new mode of transportation that is 100 
percent electric with zero direct carbon emissions. In addition to 
these benefits, it offers high-speed transportation that increases 
mobility options for travelers, reduces congestion, provides safety 
advantages, and creates economic growth with new high-tech 
manufacturing jobs.

    Question 1. With the Biden Administration's focus on climate change 
and the role the Department of Transportation will play in advancing 
our Nation's climate policy, what steps do you plan to take to help 
develop new modes of transportation that support these efforts, like 
hyperloop?
    Answer. If confirmed, I will ensure that the Department works with 
you and other external stakeholders in clean technology and fuel 
industries, including unions, industry, and local, state, Tribal, and 
territorial governments, to determine how to develop new programs and 
use existing programs to reduce pollution, address climate change, and 
provide high-quality transportation options for all Americans.

    Innovation and Equity. Nevada is proud to be on the cutting edge of 
innovative transportation technologies--including hosting the only 
statewide FAA-authorized drone test site, participating in several 
autonomous vehicle and smart transportation pilot projects, and being 
home to a Hyperloop One test bed.

    Question 2. Can you share your thoughts on how the Department under 
your leadership as Deputy Secretary can continue to encourage 
creativity and innovation in our transportation sector?
    Answer. If confirmed, I will ensure that the Department works with 
you and other stakeholders to further innovations in safety and 
mobility technologies. This includes working with unions, industry, and 
local, state, Tribal, and territorial governments, to determine how to 
develop new programs and use existing programs to create innovative 
transportation solutions that address climate, equity, economic growth 
and safety.

    Question 3. How can we attract traditionally underrepresented 
groups such as women and people of color to the transportation tech 
sector, and how can DOT partner with other agencies to promote and 
create training opportunities to build the people pipeline for 
transportation jobs?
    Answer. A diverse and inclusive workforce contributes to our 
ability to better serve the American public and supports our vision for 
innovation and equitable transportation systems. If confirmed, I will 
work in collaboration with state, local, Tribal, and territorial 
governments as well as transportation equity organizations and 
underrepresented communities, to create a more diverse transportation 
workforce that better represents our Nation. These efforts will include 
analyzing trends specific to recruitment, retention and promotion of 
underrepresented groups, listening to and engaging with Employee 
Resource Groups as the Department establishes new workforce development 
initiatives, and training managers and holding them accountable to our 
civil rights and equity commitments.

    Question 1. Surface Transportation Reauthorization
    With the pending expiration of the current surface transportation 
authorization, do you commit to working on bipartisan legislation to 
address infrastructure needs across the country, both rural and urban?
    Answer. I understand that rural communities have unique needs, 
including resource challenges and extensive unmet maintenance. I also 
know that infrastructure investments in rural America are key to 
supporting economic growth and to ensuring that residents have access 
to jobs, education and essential basic services like health care. If I 
am confirmed, I will work closely with this Committee and with the 
other key Committees as Congress works to craft a multi-year

    Question 4. Critical Freight Network
    President Biden recently issued an Executive Order on America's 
supply chains and called on the leadership of various agencies, 
including the Department of Transportation, to take action to further 
the Administration's goal of strengthening the resilience of America's 
supply chains. As the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored, our country is 
reliant on its freight network. To avoid potential supply chain 
disruptions, it is imperative that the Administration and Congress 
ensure that essential workers, such as truck drivers, and the 
transportation network have the resources and support necessary for the 
safe and efficient movement of goods. Will you commit to working with 
the Committee to monitor and support our supply chains as we continue 
to navigate through the pandemic?
    Answer. I agree that transportation workers are critical to 
providing essential passenger travel as well as supporting freight 
transportation throughout the U.S. and worldwide during the COVID-19 
pandemic. These workers provide critical services such as transporting 
individuals to testing and vaccine sites, and ensuring other essential 
workers such as healthcare professionals have access to their 
workplaces. Transportation workers also support the essential domestic 
and global supply chains by ensuring that medical supplies reach 
hospitals and health care facilities in a timely way. I am aware that 
the Department supports the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention's (CDC) recommendation to support vaccinations for critical 
infrastructure workers, like those in the maritime, transit, aviation, 
and other transportation industries. I commit to working with 
interagency partners, as well as state, local, Tribal, and territorial 
authorities, to promote expedient vaccination of transportation workers 
and to avoid potential supply chain disruptions. I look forward to

continue to meet the Nation's needs.

    Question 5. Tanker Security Program
    Within the Department of Transportation, the Maritime 
Administration serves an important national security role by supporting 
U.S.-flagged ships for strategic sealift. The National Defense Act for 
Fiscal Year 2021 authorized a Tanker Security Program to support 
strategic sealift so that the U.S. military is not forced to rely on 
foreign-flagged vessels for fuel logistics during national emergencies. 
Will you commit to following the law and standing up the Tanker 
Security Program in the time-frame and manner described in Chapter 534 
of Title 46 of the U.S. Code, so that our U.S. troops can rely on fuel 
from U.S.-flagged vessels?
    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to learning more about the goals of 
the Tanker Security Program, consistent with our authority and 
available resources.

    Question 6. U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) Recapitalization
    The U.S. is significantly short of the mariners needed for 
sustained strategic sealift in a national emergency. A prime source for 
training of these mariners is the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. 
However, the Academy desperately needs improvements to its campus to 
meet the training needs of a 21st century merchant marine. Will you 
commit to making the recapitalization and modernization of the U.S. 
Merchant Marine Academy a priority?
    Answer. Congress and DOT have been strong supporters of the U.S. 
Merchant Marine Academy's recapitalization efforts. I understand the 
critical role the maritime academies play in preparing the majority of 
entry level licensed mariners with unlimited credentials for service in 
the U.S. Merchant Marine, the U.S. Armed Forces, and the Nation's 
intermodal transportation system. If confirmed, I look forward to 
continuing this important work.

    Question 7. Travel and Tourism, National Advisory Committee on 
Travel and Tourism Infrastructure
    The COVID-19 public health emergency has significantly impacted the 
travel and tourism industry; the decline in travel and tourism spending 
in 2020 is estimated to have caused more than $500 billion in 
cumulative economic loss, which translates into a loss of millions of 
jobs and thousands of businesses. As the COVID-19 vaccine reaches more 
of the population and states modify restrictions, people will once 
again begin to travel more and go to restaurants, hotels, and vacation 
rentals in increasing numbers. Now is the time to prepare for the safe 
return of large-scale travel and tourism. The FAST Act created the 
National Advisory Committee on Travel and Tourism Infrastructure 
(NACTTI) to provide information, advice, and recommendations to the 
Secretary of Transportation on matters relating to travel and tourism 
activities. In their final report, NACTTI made five key recommendations 
to USDOT. Are you familiar with these recommendations? If so, do you 
agree with them? If confirmed, how will you--as Deputy Secretary--
prioritize investment in transportation and infrastructure projects 
that safely restart travel and tourism?
    Answer. The travel and tourism industry has been devastated 
nationwide by the COVID-19 pandemic, as I have seen firsthand in New 
York, and DOT can play an important role in its recovery. I am familiar 
with the NACTTI's work authorized under the FAST Act and the final 
report and recommendations. If confirmed, I look forward to working 
with this Committee and Secretary Buttigieg to execute President 
Biden's promise on economic recovery and helping the travel and tourism 
industry rebound.

    Question 8. Essential Air Service
    The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created challenges for 
communities receiving air service through the Essential Air Service 
(EAS) program because passenger air traffic has drastically fallen. The 
FY 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act requires the Department of 
Transportation to waive some of the subsidy eligibility restrictions 
given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. What is your perspective on 
how to ensure these and other smaller communities can receive adequate 
air service?
    Answer. I recognize the financial challenges the EAS program has 
faced under COVID-19 and that the relief provided by the suspension of 
certain eligibility requirements under the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act for FY 2020 and FY 2021 will enable this important program to 
continue to provide support to these communities. As we continue to 
recover from the economic effects of the pandemic, I am committed to 
working with Congress to ensure that the EAS program continues to serve 
small and rural communities.

    Question 9. Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act
    As you may be aware, the FY 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act 
included the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act, 
which contained numerous important reforms to the FAA's aircraft 
certification process. As the FAA works towards implementing the 
requirements in this Act, will you commit to ensuring they are 
implemented on time?
    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to working with the FAA in 
implementing the recently enacted Aircraft Certification, Safety, and 
Accountability Act as expeditiously as possible. Safety in aviation is 
paramount, and I will work with the Secretary and keep Congress updated 
on our progress as we work with the FAA to implement the Act.

    Question 10. Alliance for System Safety of UAS through Research 
Excellence (ASSURE)
    The integration of unmanned aircraft systems, known as UAS or 
drones, into the national airspace system is one of the most important 
ongoing efforts at the FAA. Unlocking the potential for UAS operations 
will be a key aspect of keeping the U.S. at the forefront of aviation, 
and robust Federal research programs will be a big part of that effort. 
The FAA's Alliance for System Safety of UAS through Research 
Excellence, known as ASSURE, is a Center of Excellence, comprised of 24 
renowned research institutions, including Mississippi State University, 
which conducts important research on integrating UAS into the National 
Airspace. Do you pledge to familiarize yourself with ASSURE as you get 
up to speed on UAS issues?
    Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I look forward to learning more about 
the FAA's ASSURE and its work on UAS operations. I also look forward to 
working with safety experts, academic researchers, industry innovators, 
and partners from Federal, state, local, Tribal, and territorial 
governments on this important technology.

    Question 11. FAA National Airspace System Commercial Space 
Integration
    As you may be aware, the number and frequency of space launches and 
re-entries from U.S. spaceports has increased dramatically. In 2020, 
the Eastern Range at Cape Canaveral, Florida, hosted 31 launches. This 
year, there are 53 launches on its schedule. As this trend continues, 
integrating these launches into the national airspace system will be 
critical to maintaining safety and maximizing airspace use. The FAA is 
working on tools such as the Space Data Integrator and Hazard Risk 
Assessment and Mitigation framework. Can you commit to ensuring that 
this important work continues?
    Answer. Should I be confirmed, I am committed to working with the 
FAA and the commercial space industry to ensure the safe operation of 
commercial space flights in our National Airspace System (NAS). We need 
to manage the airspace to ensure the NAS is safe for both passenger and 
commercial spacecraft. I look forward to better understanding and 
further developing how these tools can ensure safety while promoting 
greater efficiency.

    Question 12. FAA Commercial Space Licensing
    Last year, the FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation 
issued a final rule to streamline space launch and reentry licensing. 
As the FAA works to implement this rule, responsiveness to industry is 
key, especially given the rapid pace of innovation. If confirmed, will 
you work with industry to ensure optimal outcomes for the safety and 
growth of America's space enterprise?
    Answer. If confirmed, I am looking forward to working with the FAA 
and our commercial spaceflight operators to help build this remarkable 
new industry in the U.S. I understand the FAA is working on Advisory 
Circulars to help industry best use the streamlined rule. If confirmed, 
I commit to working with industry and continuing to focus on safety 
outcomes.

    Question 13. FAA Commercial Space Licensing
    The Office of Commercial Space Transportation is a small office 
within FAA with roughly 120 employees. Given the significant work ahead 
to implement the new launch and reentry rule, do you believe that it 
would be prudent to prioritize resources for these immediate 
implementation activities?
    Answer. If confirmed, I am interested in engaging with the Office 
of Commercial Space Transportation and assessing their capabilities and 
needs. I understand that a recent reorganization was implemented to 
ensure a more efficient connection with industry. There may be 
additional ways that DOT can help, and I intend to explore those with 
Secretary Buttigieg, the FAA, and Congress.

      Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Roy Blunt to 
                          Polly E. Trottenberg
    Question. Backup GPS
    On December 4, 2018, the Frank Lobiondo Coast Guard Authorization 
Act of 2018 was signed into law (PL 115-282). Section 514 of this law 
(49 USC 312), included a provision which was introduced in both 
chambers of Congress, titled the ``National Timing and Resiliency 
Act.'' This section of law requires that the Department of 
Transportation enter into a private-public-partnership for the purpose 
of overseeing the establishment of a terrestrial backup to satellite-
based Global Positioning System services; the purpose of which would be 
to supplement and harden precision timing capabilities.
    The statutory time requirement for implementation of this provision 
has already passed. The Department of Transportation is now two months 
late on delivering a system, as the law required a system be 
operational in two years. In order to further direct the Department of 
Transportation to implement this provision, report language was 
included in the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act (PL 116-260), 
directing the agency to fill staff vacancies for the purpose of 
implementing these statutory requirements.
    Congress could not be any clearer in the directive it has given the 
Department of Transportation regarding the implementation of this 
provision. A disruption of GPS would have wide-ranging and disastrous 
effects on the United States' national security and the broader 
economy. In 2014 the Department of Homeland Security defined GPS as a 
significant vulnerability for our Nation's economy. They stated that of 
the 16 critical infrastructure sectors of the U.S. economy, GPS was 
used by 15 and that for 13 of these sectors, GPS was a single point of 
failure.
    However, I have not received any substantive information from DOT 
on its intention to implement the requirements of PL 115-282. The only 
attestation from DOT that my staff or I have received is related to 
reporting requirements and technology demonstrations which were 
authorized through other previous legislative measures.

   If confirmed, will you implement the requirements provided 
        to DOT through PL 115-282?

   Will you provide the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senate 
        Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and my 
        personal office with a timely update on the status of this 
        provision's implementation?

   Will you provide the Senate Appropriations Committee with 
        the agency's funding needs related to the procurement of a 
        terrestrial backup GPS system?

    Answer. Resilient positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) 
services are not only important to supporting critical infrastructure 
in the transportation sector but also are essential for national, 
homeland, and economic security through the integration of millions of 
Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers into our everyday lives. Key 
PNT applications include those used for emergency response, 
transportation safety, precision agriculture, machine control for 
construction and mining, timing signals for telecommunications and 
financial transactions, high-precision instruments for local-area 
climatology studies, weather prediction, surveying, general navigation, 
and scientific applications.
    The transportation sector has some of the most stringent 
performance requirements in terms of PNT accuracy, integrity, 
availability, and reliability. If confirmed, I will continue to work 
with Congress, our Federal partners, and our stakeholders to implement 
GPS backup and complementary PNT technologies to deliver resilient PNT 
capabilities. If confirmed, I will work with the Secretary and the 
Office of Management and Budget to keep Congress informed of the 
Department's progress and funding needs.

    Question 1. Rideshare Services
    On-demand vehicle-for-hire services such as Uber and Lyft 
transformed how Americans access transportation services. As of last 
year, Uber operated in over 900 cities around the world, providing 
income for more than 5 million drivers.\1\ Uber, and services like it, 
almost instantly encountered hostile regulatory environments from big 
cities.\2\

    \2\ ``E-Hail Regulation in Global Cities.'' NYU Wagner Graduate 
School of Public Service. November 4, 2019.

   In New York City, the taxi medallion system created a 
        distorted market prone to corruption that was upended by the 
        rideshare industry. Do you believe it is the responsibility of 
        government, at any level, to prop up a quasi-governmental 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        industry at the expense of a more innovative alternative?

   Do you agree with, and if confirmed would you be supportive 
        of, the NYC taxi drivers' demand for a $500 million bailout 
        fund, largely due to a broken and distorted medallion system?

        Biden could intervene and provide assistance to NYC taxi 
        drivers.\4\ If confirmed, would you support U.S. taxpayers 
        bailing out the NYC taxi system? If so, what about other taxi 
        systems across the country?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ ``NYC taxi drivers block streets near City Hall to demand debt 
relief.'' Fox 5 New York. August 20, 2020.

    Answer. From 2014-2020, I served as the Commissioner of New York 
City's Department of Transportation, which does not oversee or regulate 
for-hire vehicles, but does play a role in analyzing the impact of the 
industry on the safety, sustainability and congestion levels of city 
streets.
    Historically, Federal officials have had no role in the state and 
local regulation of the taxi and for-hire vehicle industry, including 
with regards to any financial agreements or arrangements. If confirmed, 
I do not anticipate that DOT will be involved in any city's regulatory 
or legislative deliberations involving the for-hire vehicle industry.

    Question 2. Since 2015, revenue for yellow cab drivers has fallen 
more than 35 percent, a trend that also occurred in cities like 
Philadelphia, Chicago, and Los Angeles. As you know, in an effort to 
remedy this, in 2018 New York City attempted to regulate the amount of 
time a rideshare driver can spend searching for passengers.

   Was a similar proposal ever considered for traditional taxis 
        under the medallion system?

   New York Supreme Court Judge Lyle Frank called the rule 
        ``arbitrary and capricious'' when he annulled the rule.\5\ In 
        your written testimony to this committee, you noted that a 
        central part of President Biden's ``Build Back Better'' plan, 
        which you support, is ``foster[ing] innovation and global 
        competitiveness.'' As a general matter, do you believe 
        ``arbitrary and capricious'' rules and regulations foster 
        innovation?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ ``Judge blocks NYC's law limiting Uber drivers `cruising' for 
new passengers.'' The Verge. December 23, 2019.

   How do you reconcile your written testimony, where you say 
        you will help foster innovation if confirmed, and your history 
        in New York City of supporting rules and regulations that 
        heavily discouraged innovation and which, had they not been 
        thrown out by Judge Frank, would have disproportionately 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        negatively impacted poor and minority communities?

    Answer. In August 2018, in response to concerns about the economic 
hardships faced by taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers and growing 
traffic congestion, the New York City Council passed, by a vote of 39-
to-6, legislation authorizing the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) 
to establish and revise vehicle utilization standards for high-volume 
for-hire services and to regulate the issuance of new licenses to for-
hire vehicles. The City proceeded with minimum pay per trip rules 
immediately after the 2018 legislation.
    The legislation also tasked the TLC and NYCDOT with reviewing the 
impacts of the industry and proposing longer-term policy solutions to 
address congestion. The TLC then proceeded with a cap on cruising, 
requiring apps to maintain a minimum utilization rate in the Manhattan 
Central Business District, which had seen steep increases in congestion 
and travel speeds dropping below 5 miles per hour. The TLC did not 
propose a utilization rate for traditionally underserved areas. This 
cap on congestion was determined to be arbitrary and capricious in 
litigation brought by for-hire vehicles, but the City prevailed on 
challenges to the minimum pay per trip rules.
    As many cities, New York included, have grappled with the for-hire 
vehicle sector, NYCDOT has been deeply involved in integrating a number 
of new transportation technologies. NYCDOT has partnered with Lyft to 
create North America's largest bike share system. NYCDOT has also 
worked with a number of other transportation technology companies to 
pilot car share, dockless bike share, shared mopeds, and soon, shared 
e-scooters, as well as pay-by-cell parking.
    NYC, along with Tampa, FL and the State of Wyoming, is currently 
part of a DOT pilot program to test and deploy V2V and V2I connected 
vehicle technology to promote safer streets and reduce congestion. The 
City also partners regularly with the private construction industry on 
new technologies and advanced materials to reduce costs and improve the 
delivery of infrastructure projects.
    But even as the City embraces technological advancements, like 
other localities, it does also need to manage the safety, efficiency, 
sustainability and equity of its roadway and mass transit systems, as 
well as protecting both the public and private transportation 
workforce.

    Question 3: Can you please detail any involvement you or the NYC 
Department of Transportation had, while you were Commissioner, in the 
implementation of regulatory actions against rideshare services?

   Were any of the government officials involved in drafting or 
        passing legislation or rulemaking--either in the Mayor's 
        office, NYC DOT, or the Taxi and Limousine Commission--also 
        recipients of political donations from the NYC taxi industry?

    Answer. As noted above, as NYCDOT Commissioner I did not have a 
direct role in the regulation of rideshare services. To the best of my 
knowledge, non-elected City officials in the Mayor's Office, TLC, 
NYCDOT or elsewhere do not receive political donations of any kind. For 
elected officials, I believe that the relevant information on political 
donations in New York State is publicly available on the New York State 
Board of Elections website.

    Question 4. Disruptive Technology
    In the last decade, new transportation services and technologies 
have disrupted the status quo, particularly in urban areas. The 
Department of Transportation has had and will continue to have a 
considerable role in shaping the regulatory environment in which many 
of these innovative technologies will operate.

   In your assessment, has the Federal government's regulatory 
        approach the last four years encouraged innovation in the 
        transportation sector? What was done right and what should be 
        changed?

   If confirmed, what would your approach be to the regulatory 
        environment for innovative technologies like rideshare and 
        autonomous vehicles?

   What policy changes do you believe need to be made by 
        congress in order to provide an environment which allows 
        innovative and disruptive technology to mature and grow?
    Answer. If confirmed as Deputy Secretary, like Secretary Buttigieg, 
safety will also be my top priority, especially as it relates to new 
transportation services and technologies. I commit to advancing the 
integration of technology that improves safety for all users, and to 
working with safety advocates, industry stakeholders, and labor groups 
to reduce fatalities on our roadways. I am eager to work with you and 
your colleagues in Congress to ensure that the Federal government is 
leading the way on creating a regulatory environment that enhances 
safety and addresses climate change. Further, I will work with the 
stakeholders who have equities in the transportation innovation space, 
which includes American workers, safety advocates, industry, 
environmental groups, and others to determine how to create American 
jobs and advance American technological leadership.

    Question 5. Disruptive technology is not limited to ridesharing or 
autonomous vehicles, nor is it limited to urban areas. Unmanned aerial 
vehicle (UAV) technology could potentially provide delivery service to 
very remote, underserved areas of the country. Especially promising is 
how UAV technology could transform access for these areas in things 
like medicine and food. For example, just last year, a UAV company 
partnered with a healthcare provider to distribute personal protective 
gear and medical equipment in North Carolina.

   What do you believe is the proper approach to integration of 
        UAV technology into the national airspace system?

   Would you agree that the Integrated Pilot Program (IPP) and 
        BEYOND program, both administered under the last 
        administration, encourage long-term innovation?

    Answer. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) technology has tremendous 
potential, but the challenge for the FAA will be to ensure it is safely 
integrated into our shared airspace and at low altitudes over 
communities and residences. If confirmed, I look forward to working 
closely with Congress, the FAA, industry, state, local and tribal 
governments and other stakeholders to address the advance a thriving, 
safe UAS industry. If confirmed, I commit to familiarizing myself more 
deeply with the results from the UAS Integration Pilot Program and the 
ongoing work of BEYOND and its partners.

    Question 6. In recent years, short-range autonomous vehicle 
services have deployed across the country. They have been used for food 
delivery, medical goods, and retail. These are not traditional, full-
size automobiles, rather they are much smaller vehicles, traveling much 
shorter distances.

   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration continues 
        to solicit public comment on a delayed framework for automated 
        driving system safety (RIN 2127-AM15). Without compromising 
        roadway and pedestrian safety, what should the Department of 
        Transportation do to expedite permissions for products like 
        this, and if confirmed will you commit to working to move this 
        framework along?

    Answer. The Department recognizes that advancements in 
transportation technologies, such as autonomous vehicles, could lead to 
increased safety benefits. If confirmed, I will commit to exploring how 
these technologies can be safely integrated in our roadways and 
communities and how DOT can work with stakeholders nationwide to 
realize the benefits of autonomous vehicle technologies.

    Question 7. LNG by Rail
    The state of New York, your home state, produces less energy per 
capita than any other state in the Nation except for Rhode Island. The 
state relies heavily on natural gas for consumption, however. According 
to the Energy Information Administration, New York was the sixth-
largest natural gas consumer in 2018. In 2019, three out of every five 
households heated their homes with natural gas.
    In June 2020, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration (PHMSA) finalized a rule authorizing the bulk 
transportation of liquefied natural gas by rail. The final rule was 
based on ``an evidence-based approach to the safety of the tank cars 
designed and used to transport flammable cryogenic materials.'' New 
York State imports three-quarters of its energy needs from other 
states, suggesting New Yorkers would benefit greatly from additional 
avenues of energy transportation.

   When I asked now-Secretary Buttigieg about his commitment to 
        this rule in his nomination hearing, despite acknowledging the 
        benefits of natural gas and the fact that his city had 
        transitioned a portion of city vehicles to natural gas, he 
        refused to affirm the rule would stand. Will you commit to 
        advocating to keep the current rule in place and continuing to 
        allow LNG transportation by rail?

    Answer. With regard to LNG-by-Rail, the Administration understands 
that concerns have been raised about LNG-by-rail by many communities. 
If confirmed, I commit to reviewing the rule and ensuring that safety 
is at the forefront of any decision.

    Question 8. Infrastructure Projects
    The NYC Department of Transportation operates a $19.7 billion ten-
year capital improvement program. When you stepped down as 
commissioner, the NYC Streetsblog criticized you for a $200 million 
``foolish waste of money'' on one project, as well as ``a plan for 
fixing [an expressway] that was so bad she and the mayor had to abandon 
it.''

   Between INFRA and BUILD grants, the U.S. Department of 
        Transportation awards billions upon billions of infrastructure 
        grants each year. What lessons did you learn in New York City 
        that will prevent wasteful delays and failed projects from 
        occurring at the Federal level?

    Answer. Having participated in discretionary grant processes at 
both DOT and as a competitor in the process, I know that the Department 
places a lot of emphasis on selecting projects that are high priorities 
for the project sponsor's community, produce significant public 
benefits, and are ready to move forward within statutory timelines. As 
a local government leader, I recognize the importance of improving the 
project delivery process and exploring opportunities to make that 
process more streamlined and flexible. If confirmed, I will apply my 
experience to ensure that the Department commits to transparency and 
continues to prioritize the strongest projects for the available 
discretionary funding.

    Question 9. The American Rescue Plan, as originally passed by the 
House of Representatives, prioritized urban pet projects like a 
California subway expansion and a bridge to Canada in upstate New York. 
Correctly, the projects were ruled out of order by the Senate 
Parliamentarian and were not included in the measure which passed the 
Senate. Nonetheless, the projects were clearly unrelated to COVID 
relief and never belonged in the package in the first place. This is 
very concerning given that Congressional Democrats are preparing a 
return to earmarks and potentially the pork-barrel spending which they 
invite.

   If confirmed, what criteria would you use to evaluate 
        requests for multi-million-dollar grants to ensure the most 
        suitable candidate is chosen and taxpayer dollars aren't 
        wasted?

    Answer. If I am confirmed, I commit to using the criteria that 
Congress sets forth to evaluate all grant applications in the 
Department. It is important every discretionary grant application 
receives a fair and impartial evaluation according to the criteria, and 
that our evaluation and selection process is fully documented according 
to Departmental guidance. I commit to ensuring and enforcing 
transparency in all project selection processes.

    Question 10. As discussions about an infrastructure package have 
picked up, some have suggested Congress employ the reconciliation 
process, which as you know is a strictly partisan exercise, instead of 
going through regular order.

   Given your experience in the Senate, do you believe 
        reconciliation is the correct vehicle for an infrastructure 
        package, even if that means passing it with only partisan 
        support?

   Should you be confirmed, how will you use your position and 
        the DOT to engage with non-urban stakeholders and ensure their 
        needs are met in whatever package comes together?

    Answer. In my years in the Senate and at DOT, transportation 
authorization and appropriations legislation was drafted, negotiated, 
and passed with significant bipartisan support. If confirmed, I very 
much look forward to working with Secretary Buttigieg and the relevant 
congressional Committees to on transportation legislation that 
addresses the needs and priorities of states and localities across the 
country
    If I am confirmed, I also look forward to working with stakeholders 
from all parts of the country, ensuring that the Department is 
accessible to and proactively engaging directly with small and rural 
communities and tribal governments and the elected officials who 
represent them.

    Question 11. Congress has now passed five laws related to COVID 
relief. Combined, the legislation provides tens of billions of dollars 
for transit agencies, airlines, Amtrak, and other forms of public 
transportation.

   Governors of both red and blue states are lifting COVID 
        restrictions as more Americans are vaccinated, and life could 
        soon return to normal across the country. Given this, do you 
        believe there is a sound rationale for continuing to throw 
        taxpayer dollars at corporations and transit agencies that have 
        already received billions, and whose operations could soon be 
        somewhat normal again? If so, please provide that rationale, as 
        well as when you believe the Federal government will be able to 
        stop propping up these transit sectors.

    Answer. The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the transportation 
sector, particularly those industries like aviation, transit, passenger 
rail and intercity buses, which are heavily dependent on passenger 
revenues to operate and now face major new expenses to keep their 
systems safe for workers and the traveling public. The COVID relief 
that Congress has provided over the past year has been crucial in 
enabling our transportation system to continue to serve the public, 
particularly front line workers, and minimizing job loss and economic 
dislocation. For many of those systems, it may still be years before 
their revenue and expenditure levels return to pre-pandemic levels. But 
if confirmed, I am committed to helping restore public confidence in 
transportation and helping that industry recover financially as soon as 
possible.

    Question 12. Backup GPS
    GPS has become a part of our everyday lives. It is vitally 
important for our country's economy, including our transportation 
systems, telecommunications, financial sector, and emergency services, 
to name a few. Unfortunately, this system has increasingly come under 
threat from jamming and possible outright attack by international 
actors and has no resilient, independent backup. A disruption of GPS 
would have wide-ranging and disastrous effects on the United States' 
national security and the broader economy. In 2014 the Department of 
Homeland Security defined GPS as a significant vulnerability for our 
Nation's economy. They stated that of the 16 critical infrastructure 
sectors of the U.S. economy, GPS was used by 15 and that for 13 of 
these sectors, GPS was a single point of failure. In 2018, Congress 
passed, and the President signed into law my bill that I introduced 
with Senator Markey, the National Timing Resilience and Security Act 
(NTRSA). This legislation originated in this Committee and had 
bipartisan support from many of my fellow Committee members and the 
full Senate. The law required the Secretary of Transportation to 
establish a terrestrially based backup system to GPS by December 2020--
however that deadline has come and gone. As noted by the February 25, 
2021 letter to Secretary Pete Buttigieg from House of Representatives 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Pete DeFazio 
and the March 1, 2021 letter to acting OMB director Rob Fairweather 
from Ranking Member Sam Graves, protecting GPS, the U.S. economy, and 
our broader national security is something we can no longer afford to 
miss or delay executing.

   If confirmed, will you commit to move expeditiously to 
        complete the necessary steps to establish an operational 
        terrestrial backup GPS system, per the law Senator Markey and I 
        authored?

    Answer. Resilient positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) 
services are not only important to supporting critical infrastructure 
in the transportation sector but also are essential for national, 
homeland, and economic security through the integration of millions of 
Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers into our everyday lives. Key 
PNT applications include those used for emergency response, 
transportation safety, precision agriculture, machine control for 
construction and mining, timing signals for telecommunications and 
financial transactions, high-precision instruments for local-area 
climatology studies, weather prediction, surveying, general navigation, 
and scientific applications.
    The transportation sector has some of the most stringent 
performance requirements in terms of PNT accuracy, integrity, 
availability, and reliability. If confirmed, I will continue to work 
with Congress, our Federal partners, and our stakeholders to implement 
GPS backup and complementary PNT technologies to deliver resilient PNT 
capabilities.

    Question 13. COVID-19 Vaccine Passport
    Recently, the Department of Transportation and Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention debated requiring passengers provide proof of a 
negative COVID test prior to being allowed to fly domestically. Such a 
requirement would be impossible to implement, destroy domestic air 
travel, and runs counter to multiple scientific studies that conclude 
the risk of transmitting COVID while flying is very very small (less 
than .003 percent). There are also significant privacy concerns about 
requiring proof of a medical procedure. Such a mandate would be a 
mistake.

   Millions of Americans are now receiving COVID vaccines every 
        day, suggesting the pandemic may soon be behind us. I remain 
        concerned, however, that public accommodations, as defined by 
        U.S. code, will be allowed and encouraged to require proof of 
        vaccination or perhaps develop some sort of ``vaccine 
        passport'' a consumer must present prior to entering a store, 
        renting a hotel room, or using public transportation like a 
        city subway, Amtrak, or board a plane. Do you agree it would be 
        wrong to invade Americans' personal privacy and infringe on 
        their freedoms by impeding their right to travel by requiring 
        them to produce proof of COVID vaccination prior to reentering 
        society?

    Answer. I am aware that DOT has been working with industry and 
other stakeholders to determine what it will take to restore public 
trust in public transportation in a way that is practical, broadly 
supported, and meets public health standards. I look forward to working 
with Congress and the Administration to determine sensible solutions 
for the safety and viability of the U.S. transportation sector while 
protecting transportation workers and the traveling public.

    Question 14. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards
    As you are aware, the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) regulates fuel economy and greenhouse gas 
emission standards for passenger vehicles. It is widely expected that 
the Biden administration will review the Trump administration's Safer 
Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule and replace it with 
standards that are more stringent--potentially increasing costs for 
consumers. Raising the cost of producing passenger vehicles, and by 
extension raising the price of vehicles for consumers during a 
pandemic, is a terrible idea.

   If confirmed, can you promise to oppose regulations that 
        will raise the cost of passenger vehicles for consumers?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit that I will review proposed 
rulemakings and review the required analysis on estimated costs and 
benefits for consumers.

    Question 15. Aircraft CO2 Rule
    In 2016, under the Obama administration, more than 190 countries 
reached a historic multilateral agreement on aircraft CO2 
emission standards and a carbon offset scheme for international 
flights. The agreement reached at the meeting organized by 
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) meeting was 
characterized by ICAO Council President Dr. Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu as 
``practical'' in a press release, in which he also said it would 
``serve as a positive and sustainable contributor to global greenhouse 
gas emissions reduction.'' \6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ https://www.icao.int/Newsroom/Pages/Historic-agreement-reached-
to-mitigate-international-aviation-emissions.aspx
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Since the agreements were signed, the European Union and United 
States have both adopted domestic CO2 emission standards 
that are compliant with the agreement and provide the basis for 
aircraft manufacturers to demonstrate compliance with the new 
requirements. However, the FAA has still not completed the rule to 
provide the framework and process for U.S. manufacturers to certify 
their aircraft so they can be exported and operate internationally.

   If confirmed, will you commit to moving forward and 
        finalizing this important rule in 2021? Further, if confirmed 
        will you commit to adhering to the agreement previously reached 
        and not re-opening it to add additional burdensome regulations?

    Answer. I am aware the DOT collaborated closely with the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the development of the EPA's 
final rule to implement the ICAO standard, published on January 11 of 
this year. As customary for implementation of international aviation 
emissions standards, the EPA first publishes a rule under the Clean Air 
Act, followed by an FAA rulemaking to establish airworthiness 
certification requirements. Under Executive Order 13990, I understand 
the EPA rulemaking is currently under review, and subject to the 
outcome of that review, if confirmed, I commit to working with FAA to 
finalize the rulemaking as expeditiously as possible.
    As to the second question, the U.S. led the efforts to reach a 
landmark resolution on climate change at the General Assembly of the 
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016, and supported 
the ICAO Council adoption of Standards and Recommended Practices for 
the Aircraft CO2 standard. I commit to continued support for 
those outcomes and for continued U.S. engagement to support ICAO's 
ongoing efforts to address the climate impacts of aviation.

  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Marsha Blackburn to 
                          Polly E. Trottenberg
    Question 1. Mineral Definition
    Mrs. Trottenberg: The raw materials provided by the aggregate 
industry are necessary for virtually every public works project across 
the country, and these raw material operators adhere to various Federal 
agencies concerning the rocks they quarry.

   How would you support the need for accurate mineral 
        definitions to maintain an efficient construction supply chain 
        and deliver infrastructure projects in a timely manner?

    Answer. There are a limited number of existing aggregate resource 
sites in our nation, and we need to take coordinated efforts to ensure 
the availability and reasonable price of these resources without 
compromising our commitments to safety or environmental protection. If 
confirmed, I look forward to working with you, your colleagues, and 
other stakeholders to explore what actions can be taken to sustain our 
supply of aggregates.

    Question 2. Transportation Systems
    Mrs. Trottenberg: Many cities have access to a wealth of 
information and data for planning purposes, but it is often siloed 
within different city departments and agencies.

   How can DOT help drive efficiencies and work to see that 
        data is adequately and safely shared between different public 
        agencies, the private sector, and stakeholders to ensure 
        delivery of better transportation systems?

    Answer. In my experience, transportation is an increasingly data 
and technology driven field and advances in data analytics are enabling 
transportation agencies to dramatically improve how they design and 
manage their systems. But cities and states often face enormous 
challenges in managing and analyzing the growing volume of data streams 
and integrating that data with their many legacy IT systems in and 
among different agencies. If confirmed, I look forward to working with 
State, local, Tribal, and territorial officials, community 
stakeholders, and the private sector to support and disseminate best 
practices for managing, analyzing and sharing data for the 
transportation system, while also focusing on security and privacy 
protection.

    Question 3. Truck Driver Shortage
    Mrs. Trottenberg: The U.S. truck driver shortage is worsened by the 
industry's struggles to recruit new drivers.

   Will you commit to working with me to fix the regulatory 
        barriers that prevent or deter capable drivers from entering 
        the trucking workforce?

    Answer. I know there are significant concerns about truck driver 
shortages, driver retention and an aging driver population at a time 
when our economy is increasingly dependent on freight movement by 
truck. If confirmed, look forward to working with all the relevant 
stakeholders on this challenge, with a focus on safety and working 
conditions and how to best recruit, train and retain drivers.

    Question 4. Pipelines
    Mrs. Trottenberg: As you know, pipelines are the safest and most 
efficient method of transporting energy in America.

   Will DOT and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
        Administration (PHMSA) provide a transparent process for 
        pipeline operators for the safe and continued operations of 
        America's essential pipelines?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with Secretary Buttigieg to 
ensure DOT and PHMSA provide a transparent process for pipeline 
operators for the safe and continued operations of the U.S. pipeline 
network. I think it is essential that DOT promotes research and 
development initiatives aimed at deploying new technologies to enhance 
pipeline safety and reliability while addressing potential 
environmental impacts.

    Question 5. Motor Carrier Liability Insurance
    Mrs. Trottenberg: Can you ensure DOT will not circumvent Congress 
and mandate an increase in insurance requirements through the 
regulatory process, given the absence of data indicating it would 
improve safety?
    Answer. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-
21) required the Department to report to Congress, every four years, on 
the current minimum financial responsibility requirements for motor 
carriers of property and passengers. It is my understanding that the 
Department will be sending its latest iteration of that report to 
Congress this year. I am gaining familiarity with this issue, but I do 
recognize it is an issue of great importance to many of the 
Department's key stakeholders. Both the Secretary and I will listen to 
our partners in industry and in the safety community before developing 
a path forward and will keep Congress informed.
                                 ______
                                 
      Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Mike Lee to 
                          Polly E. Trottenberg
    Question 1. Ms. Trottenberg, has the Federal government 
overextended itself in funding infrastructure projects? Should we 
expand or reduce the scope of the Federal government in funding 
infrastructure projects?

   What is the appropriate role of the states, and what is the 
        appropriate role of the Federal government in handling these 
        types of projects?

   You and Secretary Buttigieg will be advising President Biden 
        and Congress as we approach FAST Act reauthorization. What FAST 
        Act Programs would you recommend prioritizing in level of 
        importance, if confirmed?

    Answer. If confirmed, I am committed to working with Secretary 
Buttigieg and Congress to realize President Biden's vision for a 
transformational investment in American infrastructure, to make it 
safer, more equitable, more sustainable, and one that will create 
millions of good-paying jobs. That includes leveraging the funding and 
financing resources of the Department to work with Congressional, 
state, local, Tribal, territorial, and other partners to help build 
projects that achieve these goals. The Department is committed to 
making the funding and financing pipeline for transportation projects 
as streamlined and transparent as possible. With the FAST Act expiring 
at the end of this Fiscal Year, DOT and the Biden Administration look 
forward to engaging with Congress and other key stakeholders on the 
next reauthorization. If confirmed, I am committed to providing the 
Department's expertise and experience in implementing the FAST Act and 
working closely with Congress on legislation that addresses 
transportation needs across the country.

    Question 2. Ms. Trottenberg, how would you describe the current 
state of the Highway Trust Fund?

   Can we continue to afford spending more than we are taking 
        in?

   As we approach FAST Act reauthorization, will you oppose a 
        reauthorization plan that requires more irresponsible deficit 
        spending in our surface transportation programs?

    Answer. Since 2008, the ongoing and growing imbalance between 
Highway Trust Fund spending and receipts has remained a significant 
issue. If confirmed, I will work with Federal partners, the Committee 
and with the other key Committees to address our long-standing funding 
challenges.

    Question 3. Ms. Trottenberg, some have proposed addressing our 
Highway Trust Fund shortfalls by increasing revenue. A Federal gas tax 
raise is often thrown around as one means to increase this revenue. The 
Biden administration has said they will not raise taxes on middle-
income Americans, which, as Secretary Buttigieg said recently, ``rules 
out approaches like the old-fashioned gas tax.'' \7\ Can you give us a 
clear commitment, as Secretary Buttigieg has done, that you will not 
support raising the gas tax?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/buttigieg-
says-gas-tax-hike-would-violate-biden-campaign-pledge

   Gas taxes hit the hardest on those who cannot always 
        purchase the newest, most fuel-efficient vehicles or expensive 
        electric cars. It also harms rural drivers who rely more on 
        their vehicles to travel and have less access to electric 
        charging infrastructure. Do you agree that the gas tax is a 
        regressive tax and raising it would unfairly impact rural and 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        low-income Americans?

    Answer. My role is to advise the Secretary on all aspects of 
transportation policy and advocate for the decisions he makes. I think 
it is important that as we transition to cleaner, sustainable and more 
efficient methods of transportation, we decide together how to best 
address that transition. This includes not only figuring out how to 
fund that transition, but also to make sure it occurs equitably so that 
rural and low-income Americans are not left behind. If confirmed, I 
will work with the Secretary, our interagency partners, the Committee 
and with the other key Committees to address our long-standing funding 
challenges.

    Question 4. Ms. Trottenberg, the Department of Transportation is 
responsible for regulating aviation in the United States. One debate 
taking place at the FAA is the issue of drone regulation. Low-altitude 
drones are a major focus for the states, who through their inherent 
police powers, govern matters such as property rights, land use, 
trespass, privacy, and local safety issues. When Secretary Buttigieg 
came before this Committee, he agreed with me that there should be a 
clear role for authorities outside of the Federal government, such as 
state and local authorities, to regulate drones in some of these 
matters. You have an interesting background as Commissioner of the New 
York City Department of Transportation. Would you agree with Secretary 
Buttigieg? Do you think that state and local governments have a clear 
role to play in the regulation of low-altitude drone operations?

   In the context of drone operations, the FAA has taken the 
        position that they control the airspace from the ground up. Do 
        you think the Federal government has the ability to regulate 
        the airspace a couple of feet above your lawn? What about mere 
        inches above the blades of grass? In other words, should air 
        inches above your backyard or front lawn be considered Federal 
        airspace?

    Answer. It is my understanding that the FAA is proactively engaged 
with communities and local law enforcement as it develops its 
regulations. If confirmed, I will continue to encourage collaboration 
with state, local and tribal governments as I know firsthand what an 
essential role they play. I will work with Congress to develop a path 
forward that prioritizes safety and enables us to benefit from 
innovations like UAS.

    Question 5. Ms. Trottenberg, do you believe the Department of 
Transportation has authority to regulate ``intrastate'' transportation? 
If so, to what extent?

   Recently, the Department of Transportation and the CDC 
        issued a COVID-19 mask mandate to require masks be worn on some 
        intrastate transit preempting state decisions. Is this an 
        appropriate use of the Federal government's authority?

    Answer. The Administration has acted swiftly to combat COVID-19, 
including numerous Executive Orders aimed at protecting travelers and 
reducing the spread of COVID-19. I am aware of the Department's ongoing 
efforts, including implementing CDC's mask mandates for public 
transportation, protecting transportation workers, and working with 
interagency partners, under the Department's existing legal authority. 
I am fully committed to continuing to leverage the Department's 
resources to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, including supporting the 
President's American Rescue Plan and the broader response.

    Question 6. Ms. Trottenberg, during his questioning at your 
hearing, Senator Hickenlooper asked you about the streamlining of 
commercial space launch and reentry regulations \8\ at the FAA, which 
are currently set to take effect on March 10, 2021. Do you support the 
new streamlined launch and reentry licensing requirements?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/10/2020-
22042/streamlined-launch-and-reentry-license-requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer. If confirmed, I am looking forward to working with the FAA 
and our commercial spaceflight operators to help build this remarkable 
new industry in the United States. I understand the FAA is working on 
Advisory Circulars to help industry best use the streamlined rule. If 
confirmed, I commit to working with industry and continuing to focus on 
safety outcomes.

    Question 7. The Office of Commercial Space Transportation was 
established for two purposes: (1) to protect public health and safety 
through regulation and (2) to promote the economic development of space 
by facilitating and encouraging space launches by the private 
sector.\9\ This dual mandate--safety and promoting commerce--is unusual 
for DOT agencies, which usually just are charged with public safety. If 
confirmed, how will you appropriately balance the carrying out of these 
dual mandates?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to discussing with the FAA how 
those missions are balanced today and better understanding how we can 
enhance that balance, both in terms of avoiding conflicts of interest, 
but also in terms of the appropriate resources dedicated to these 
missions. I am committed to working with FAA and industry to ensure 
safe operations in our National Airspace System, should I be confirmed.
                                 ______
                                 
Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Shelley Moore Capito to 

                          Polly E. Trottenberg
    Question 1. In the past, the Department of Transportation has 
allocated Department resources to large urban projects and often times 
left rural areas underfunded. Secretary Chao did a very good job 
recognizing that and making a concerted effort to use the Department's 
discretionary authority and discretionary grant programs, like BUILD 
and INFRA, to help rural America. And I look forward to working with 
Secretary Buttigieg on ensuring rural communities don't get left behind 
again.

   Will you commit, if confirmed, to address the unique 
        transportation needs of rural parts of our country?

   Will you commit to making sure that eligible projects in 
        rural areas receive their fair share of resources from the 
        Department's discretionary grant programs, such as BUILD and 
        INFRA?

    Answer. I understand that rural communities have unique needs, 
including resource challenges and extensive unmet maintenance. I also 
know that infrastructure investments are key to supporting economic 
growth and to ensuring that residents in rural communities have access 
to jobs, education access and essential basic services like health 
care. If confirmed, I will commit to making sure that eligible projects 
in rural areas receive their fair consideration for competitive 
discretionary grants.

    Follow-Up Question. Currently, both INFRA and BUILD grants set 
aside a certain percentage of funding for rural projects. Most 
recently, DOT issued a notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) for FY2021 
INFRA grants, with a new emphasis on climate change and racial equity.

   If confirmed, do you commit to being transparent with this 
        Committee on the decision-making process for awarding 
        competitive grants from programs, such as INFRA and BUILD?

   Do you commit, if confirmed to ensuring that the policy, 
        regulatory, and funding decisions made by the Department 
        consider the unique transportation needs of both rural and 
        urban communities?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work with the Secretary to ensure that 
the DOT implements a balanced investment program that meets the needs 
of all communities, including rural communities. I will also ensure 
that discretionary grant programs meet the selection and reporting 
requirements set forth by Congress in legislation.

    Question 2. According to NHTSA, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly 
decreased the amount of traffic on our Nation's highway system. 
However, a recent report by NHTSA revealed that fatality rate during 
that same period increased, as did risky driving behaviors, such as 
driving without a seatbelt and driving under the influence of drugs and 
alcohol.

   In your testimony, you mention how New York was able to 
        lower traffic fatalities even though fatalities rose 
        nationally. What are some of the initiatives New York 
        implemented in order to make streets safer?

    Answer. New York became the first U.S. city to adopt Vision Zero, a 
comprehensive and data-driven program to eliminate all traffic 
fatalities and severe injuries, while increasing safe, sustainable and 
equitable mobility for all. Even as traffic fatalities rose nationally, 
through our efforts in New York, we saw years of safer streets for all 
road users. Some of the initiatives that we adopted included 
prioritizing safe street design, lowering the city speed limit to 25 
miles per hour, deploying school safety cameras, providing state-of-
the-art training and safety education to commercial vehicle operators, 
and conducting targeted outreach to vulnerable road users.
    But New York City, like cities all across the country, did see a 
tragic spike in roadway crashes and fatalities during the pandemic, 
with speed and reckless driving behavior being major contributing 
factors. If confirmed, I look forward to making roadway safety 
nationwide a priority, with a focus on roadway design, driver behavior 
and vehicle safety standards.

    Question 3. Do you commit, if confirmed, to ensure that appropriate 
Department of Transportation staff promptly and thoroughly respond to 
questions, information requests, and requests for technical assistance 
from relevant congressional committees, regardless of whether the 
question or request is made by the committee's chairman or the 
committee's ranking member?
    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to ensuring that appropriate 
Department of Transportation staff will promptly and thoroughly respond 
to questions, information requests, and requests for technical 
assistance from relevant Congressional committees, regardless of 
whether the question or request is made by the Committee's chair or 
ranking member.

    Question 4. We are past due to pass a surface transportation 
reauthorization bill this year. In order to deliver a bill before the 
current extension expires on September 30th, a great deal of work and 
cooperation will be needed between the Department and Congress. As 
Ranking Member on the Environment and Public Works Committee, I know 
that Senator Carper and I agree that our process must be bipartisan, 
that means there must be some give and take by both parties.

   Do I have your commitment that, if confirmed, you will work 
        with me and others to craft a reauthorization bill that meets 
        our country's transportation needs and will earn support from 
        members of both parties in both chambers?

   Does the Biden Administration intend to develop and provide 
        to Congress its own proposal to reauthorize Federal surface 
        transportation programs? If so, what is the protected time-
        frame for that proposal?

    Answer. If confirmed, I commit to working closely with Secretary 
Buttigieg, this Committee, and with the other key Committees on a 
bipartisan basis as Congress works to craft a multi-year 
reauthorization proposal that meets the needs of all communities, 
including rural communities.
                                 ______
                                 
     Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Rick Scott to 
                          Polly E. Trottenberg
    Question 1. The Biden Administration has indicated that combatting 
climate change, as well as many aspects of the Green New Deal, will be 
a focus across several sectors. My view is that we can address climate 
change and grow our economy at the same time. My concern is that the 
Green New Deal would bankrupt the nation, hurt our economy and kill 
small businesses with its excessive, unrealistic regulations.

   Do you plan to implement aspects of the Green New Deal 
        within DOT and what impact do you believe this will have on the 
        private sector and small businesses?

    Answer. The transportation sector has a key role to play in 
addressing climate change, and if confirmed, I will continue to support 
the advancement of clean transportation technologies and will work with 
you and other stakeholders, including unions, industry, and local, 
state, Tribal, and territorial governments to determine how to create 
new programs and use existing programs to create innovative solutions 
to climate change. American innovation will indeed be critical to 
combating climate change and ensuring our global competitiveness. The 
Department's regulatory actions should be smart, forward-leaning, and 
recognize and enable innovation and effective new technologies.

    Question 2. Aviation oversight is a large sector within DOT. How do 
you and the Biden administration plan to address the ongoing challenges 
that air travel faces during this pandemic from a safety and economic 
perspective?
    Answer. The Biden-Harris Administration has acted swiftly to combat 
COVID-19, including numerous Executive Orders aimed at protecting 
travelers and reducing the spread of COVID-19. I know the Department 
implemented CDC's mask mandates for public transportation, enhanced 
civil penalties for noncompliant passengers that create safety risks 
onboard aircraft, and provided aircrews with educational materials they 
can use to inform the flying public. However, we must also look beyond 
the pandemic to our future operations. For example, aircraft fleets 
that have been idle for more than a year will be returning to service, 
and the FAA is preparing to ramp up inspections, training and personnel 
staffing on site as air traffic starts to recover. If confirmed, I will 
work with Secretary Buttigieg and the FAA to assure aviation safety is 
our top priority as we return to post-pandemic life. Lessons learned 
from the pandemic will help us better prepare for future challenges 
that will stress our operations.

    Question 3. DOT has approximately 55,000 employees. What experience 
do you believe makes you most qualified to help lead an agency of this 
size?
    Answer. I have nearly three decades of operational, managerial, and 
policymaking experience, including the last seven years as the 
Commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation, a high-
profile transportation agency of nearly 6,000 employees and a multi-
billion operating and capital budget, which oversees one of the 
Nation's largest urban roadway, bridge, and traffic operations systems 
as well as the second largest passenger ferry system.
    I also served at the DOT in the Obama Administration as both 
Undersecretary for Policy, the number three official at the agency, and 
Assistant Secretary for Policy and I am very familiar with the 
operations, procedures, challenges and needs of the Department.

    Question 4. As Deputy Secretary of Transportation, how would you 
address the fact that the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is going insolvent, 
and do you believe we need to increase the Federal gas tax?
    Answer. Since 2008, the ongoing and growing imbalance between 
Highway Trust Fund spending and receipts has remained a significant 
issue. If confirmed, I will work with Federal partners, the Committee 
and with the other key Committees to address our long-standing funding 
challenges.

    Question 5. As Governor of Florida, I rejected Federal taxpayer 
dollars to fund high-speed rail because it would have put Floridians on 
the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars. Instead, the state of 
Florida worked to find a creative solution that would allow for private 
investment in high-speed rail--which means zero financial risk for 
Florida taxpayers. We've seen what happened in California, where the 
Department of Transportation cancelled nearly $1 billion in Federal 
money for its high-speed rail project.

   How do you see the Department of Transportation addressing 
        Federal grant money requests for high-speed rail? How will you 
        ensure taxpayers aren't on the hook for waste, fraud and abuse?

   What do you see as the private sector's role in high-speed 
        rail?

    Answer. If confirmed as Deputy Secretary, I commit to working with 
Secretary Buttigieg, interagency partners, and Congress to make sure 
that America has the safest, cleanest, and most efficient rail system 
in the world. I look forward to working with Congress to improve 
passenger rail service while at the same time focusing on 
environmental, safety, and economic benefits, especially in 
historically disadvantaged areas and underserved corridors. In 
addition, I look forward to working with both private and public-sector 
entities to explore options that would help us expand our rail network 
all across the country.

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Cynthia Lummis to 
                          Polly E. Trottenberg
    Question 1. Does the Biden Administration plan to release a 
comprehensive blueprint for the upcoming highway bill reauthorization?

   If so, when can members of this committee expect to see a 
        copy?

   Will this blueprint include recommendations to Congress for 
        possible pay-fors?

    Answer. If confirmed, I will work closely with Secretary Buttigieg, 
this Committee, and with the other key Committees as Congress works to 
craft a multi-year reauthorization proposal that meets the needs of all 
communities, including rural communities. I will also work with the 
Administration, Secretary Buttigieg and the relevant congressional 
Committees to address the program's long-standing fiscal challenges.

    Question 2. Do you believe that budgetary constraints on staffing 
in rural states place them at a competitive disadvantage when it comes 
to applying for discretionary grants from DOT?

   If so, are there efforts underway to streamline the 
        application process to ease the administrative burden on 
        states?

   Is the administration concerned with the addition of new 
        grant programs in lieu of formula funds that would increase the 
        administrative burden on states applying for funds?

    Answer. When I served previously at DOT, the Department provided 
technical assistance to many low-resource applicants, and we 
successfully made awards to projects in some of the most rural and 
remote regions of the U.S. In fact, I found these programs were 
particularly popular with many communities who otherwise do not have 
access to Federal transportation funding distributed through 
traditional formula programs. If confirmed, I will ensure that all 
applicants with eligible projects have the opportunity to compete on a 
level-playing field.

    Question 3. Do you believe that existing grant programs, such as 
BUILD or INFRA, successfully balance urban needs with those of rural 
states?
    Answer. The INFRA and BUILD programs have been both popular and 
successful in large part because they have enabled local jurisdictions 
to apply directly for funding. If I am confirmed, I will ensure that 
the DOT implements a balanced investment program that meets the needs 
of all communities, including rural communities. I understand that 
rural communities have unique needs, including resource challenges and 
extensive unmet maintenance. I also know that infrastructure 
investments in rural America are key to supporting economic growth and 
to ensuring that residents have access to jobs, education and essential 
basic services like health care. If confirmed, I will also ensure that 
discretionary grant programs meet the requirements set forth by 
Congress in legislation.

    Question 4. Is DOT considering significant updates to its National 
Performance Management Measures (23 CFR 490)? If so, please list what 
changes or additions are under consideration.
    Answer. I am not aware of any public statements considering 
significant updates to the National Performance Management Measures but 
will commit to report updates to the Committee when they are 
considered.

    Question 5. Do you consider the seven-year average timeline for 
Federal permitting on infrastructure to be an adequate timeline?

   If not, what updates are under consideration to expedite 
        project delivery?

   Should Congress codify deadlines for Federal permitting of 
        infrastructure projects?

   Does the Biden Administration plan to rescind or amend the 
        One Federal Decision policy?

    Answer. I recognize the importance of identifying improvements to 
our Federal permitting system that can incorporate the voices of 
stakeholders and efficiently deliver the projects that communities 
need. I commit to ensuring that we make investments and implement 
programs that enable our transportation system to support economic 
growth and opportunity for all Americans.
