    SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

    TO:      LMembers, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure
    FROM:  LStaff, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure
    RE:      LFull Committee Hearing on ``Implementing the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act''
_______________________________________________________________________


                                PURPOSE

    The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will 
meet on Tuesday, July 19, 2022, at 10:00 a.m. EDT in 2167 
Rayburn House Office Building and virtually via Zoom for a 
hearing titled ``Implementing the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act.'' The hearing will provide an opportunity for Members 
of the Committee to discuss the Administration's actions to 
date in implementing the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
(IIJA; P.L. 117-58). The Committee will hear testimony from the 
Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation 
(DOT).

                               BACKGROUND

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

    Pursuant to House Rule X (1)(r), the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure (Committee) authorizes 
programs carried out by the following DOT modal administrations 
and offices:
     LFederal Aviation Administration (FAA);
     LFederal Highway Administration (FHWA);
     LFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration 
(FMCSA);
     LNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA);
     LFederal Transit Administration (FTA);
     LFederal Railroad Administration (FRA);
     LMaritime Administration (MARAD);
     LPipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration (PHMSA);
     LGreat Lakes Saint Lawrence Seaway Development 
Corporation (GLS); and
     LOffice of the Secretary (OST).

    On December 15, 2020, President Biden nominated Pete 
Buttigieg to be the Secretary of Transportation. The Senate 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a 
confirmation hearing on the nomination on January 21, 2021. The 
Senate confirmed Secretary Buttigieg on February 2, 2021, by a 
vote of 86-13.

INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT

    Last November, Congress enacted the bipartisan 
infrastructure framework, passed as the Senate Amendment to 
H.R. 3684, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This 
legislation provided billions of dollars to sustain and 
modernize our highway, transit, rail, airport, port, and 
wastewater infrastructure. These investments will help 
construct, repair, and replace airports, roads, bridges, 
transit systems, railroads, and pipelines; improve safety; 
reduce carbon pollution from the transportation sector; reduce 
congestion at ports; and improve air and water quality.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ As described in Views and Estimates of the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure for Fiscal Year 2023, p 1. https://
transportation.house.gov/imo/media/doc/FY23%20Views
%20and%20Estimates_Final.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As stated in the fiscal year 2023 Views and Estimates 
adopted by the committee on April 28, 2022: ``[o]versight of 
responsible implementation of the IIJA is a top priority for 
the committee this year as we work to ensure that Americans all 
over the country, rural and urban alike, proportionally share 
in the benefits from these historic investments.'' \2\ This 
hearing is an IIJA oversight activity of the committee and 
represents an opportunity for the committee to ensure that the 
IIJA is responsibly implemented.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ Id., p 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The IIJA provides $660 billion over five years to be 
distributed by DOT through formula programs and competitive 
grants to states, local governments, metropolitan planning 
organizations, transit agencies, tribes, passenger and freight 
railroad carriers, ports, airports, and other eligible 
recipients.\3\ This amount includes the following topline

    The guaranteed funding provided by the IIJA flows to 
funding recipients through more than 100 grant programs 
authorized by the legislation and administered by DOT and 
includes both formula and competitive grants. A comprehensive 
list of these programs across modal agencies and total funding 
available for each program can be found on DOT's website.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Formula program funding is apportioned to recipients each 
fiscal year (FY). States were initially notified of their first 
year (FY 2022) of IIJA highway funding, totaling $52.5 billion, 
in an apportionment notice issued on December 14, 2021, and the 
agency has issued subsequent apportionment notices specific to 
the Bridge Formula Program, Appalachian Highway Development 
System funds, and the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure 
formula funds.\14\ State departments of transportation 
generally have four fiscal years in which to obligate these 
formula funds.\15\ Transit agencies were notified of their 
first year (FY 2022) of IIJA transit formula funding, totaling 
$13.4 billion, in an apportionment notice announced on April 6, 
2022, once funding for the full fiscal year was made available 
with the passage of the FY 2022 appropriations bill.\16\ 
Obligation timelines vary by transit formula program, but in 
most cases agencies have several fiscal years to obligate 
funding.\17\ Airports were notified of their first year (FY 
2022) of IIJA Airport Infrastructure Grant formula funding, 
totaling $2.89 billion, in an apportionment notice announced on 
December 16, 2021.\18\ Airports will generally have four fiscal 
years to obligate these funds. Funds not obligated at the end 
of the fourth fiscal year will be recovered by the FAA and made 
available for competitive grants in the fifth fiscal year.\19\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    For competitive grant programs, DOT first issues a Notice 
of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) which sets forth eligibilities 
under the particular grant, factors for applicant evaluation, 
the period of time during which interested parties can apply, 
and other relevant information. DOT posts NOFOs and applicants 
generally apply through the federal www.grants.gov website. 
Since the enactment of the IIJA, DOT has issued NOFOs for the 
following competitive grant programs (with grant opportunity 
numbers or NOFO publications noted parenthetically):
     LReconnecting Communities Pilot Discretionary 
Grant Program (DOT-RCP-FY22-01)
     LBridge Investment Program (693JJ322NF00009)
     LLocal and Regional Project Assistance Grants

    To provide assistance and information on future funding 
opportunities for potential applicants, DOT has posted on its 
website anticipated dates for future grant notices.\20\ DOT has 
also created the ``Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Dashboard,'' 
which allows users to view IIJA funding by modal 
administration, fiscal year, and other factors such as funding 
source and program type.\21\ In addition, in May 2022 the White 
House published a document entitled ``Building a Better 
America: A Guidebook to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 
State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Governments, and Other 
Partners'' which outlines each of the funding programs 
available under the IIJA.\22\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    DOT has also launched the DOT Navigator website, which 
lists resources to ``help communities understand the best ways 
to apply for grants, and to plan for and deliver transformative 
infrastructure projects and services'' and provides a one-stop 
shop for technical assistance resources available through 
DOT.\23\ The Office of Management and Budget separately issued 
implementation guidance in the form of a memorandum on April 
18, 2022, regarding the application of Buy America requirements 
to infrastructure funding that Congress enacted as part of the 
IIJA.\24\

    And with that, I am going to give a brief opening 
statement.
    I want to thank the Secretary for being here today. We are 
holding this hearing to do some oversight on the implementation 
of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and I appreciate 
you being here today to tell us about the progress.
    This may be a long day, and I appreciate the fact that you 
are going to make time available in the hope that all Members 
who have questions will have an opportunity. So, we are going 
to move along quickly, and we are going to strictly observe 
time limits, so that we can move through this with as many 
Members participating as possible.
    I really appreciate the fact that the IIJA money is getting 
out the door at a record pace. I mean, this is something that I 
have been looking forward to and working on since Obama was 
President when I passed the bill out of subcommittee to 
increase spending by $350 billion, which at that time seemed 
like a phenomenal amount, and obviously this one is $660 
billion.
    Finally, after 12 years, we have got that, and this is 
larger than anything else the Department has ever had to deal 
with before. And as I understand it, you have so far 
apportioned $75 billion in highway, transit, and airport 
formula funds, issued Notices of Funding Opportunity for tens 
of billions of dollars more through 22 competitive grant 
programs. This is absolutely unprecedented in terms of the 
investments we are making and the pace at which we are putting 
this money out.
    The stakes are high. We want to get this money out. 
Inflation is eating into what we are going to be able to build. 
And the more quickly we can commit the funds, the more we will 
get done.
    I expect that we will hear some criticism from my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle, but sadly, almost 
none of them here today or on this committee voted for this 
legislation, which was amazing to me at the time of passage. I 
know Donald Trump didn't like it because he couldn't do it, and 
this actually got done.
    But it is a record amount of long overdue investment, and 
we aren't just, as I said before--and, please, we are not just 
trying to do Eisenhower 8.0.
    At the same time, you are looking at--you have guidance on 
``fix it first,'' something that was stripped out by the 
Senate, the 10 Members of the Senate, 10 Republicans and 2 
Democrats, none of whom have a major role on any of the 3 
committees of jurisdiction in the Senate who wrote this bill.
    They used our template in terms of money and more routine 
things, but they bristled at the idea that we would deal 
meaningfully with climate change and look at alternatives to 
just an infinite amount of highway building, which will not 
solve our problems. As we all know, there is something called 
induced demand.
    I talked a lot about the Virginia Railway Express as 
opposed to expanding 95 South, and I am hoping States will 
replicate that around the country where we can reduce carbon 
pollution, move people more efficiently, and look toward a 
21st-century system in this country.
    I appreciate the fact that you are encouraging the States. 
You are not mandating or penalizing them. You are not taking 
away decisionmaking authority. But we are just asking them--and 
I have spoken to the American Association of State Highway and 
Transportation Officials about this--just take a look at this.
    Fix it first, do the critical maintenance we need to do, 
and then, secondly, when you are having a congestion problem, 
look and see what is the best solution. Is it: Attempt to build 
more highway-miles? Or is there a way to move the people more 
efficiently?
    I also appreciate the fact--I will be sending you a letter 
soon to support your efforts to require a measurement reduction 
of greenhouse gases. Transportation is our single largest 
source of carbon pollution, and we do need to address that.
    [Mr. DeFazio's prepared statement follows:]

                                 
   Prepared Statement of Hon. Peter A. DeFazio, a Representative in 
      Congress from the State of Oregon, and Chair, Committee on 
                   Transportation and Infrastructure
    Welcome to today's hearing to examine the implementation of the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Thank you, Secretary 
Buttigieg, for taking time to sit with this committee today.
    We extend our appreciation to you in advance for what may be a long 
day, to ensure that every Member of our committee who wants to ask 
questions has an opportunity to do so. Given the pace with which the 
U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has been getting IIJA money out 
the door, we know you would likely be working to implement this bill 
today if you were not here with us.
    Last November, Congress enacted the largest one-time infusion of 
federal funds into our nation's infrastructure and transportation 
network. The IIJA, also referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law, provided $660 billion for DOT to administer and distribute. This 
topline dollar amount, and the number of grant programs DOT must 
compete out, are significantly larger than any other past 
transportation authorization or infrastructure bill provided to the 
Department.
    In the eight months since enactment of the law, DOT has apportioned 
the $75 billion in highway, transit, and airport formula funds provided 
in the IIJA for fiscal year 2022, and has issued Notices of Funding 
Opportunity for tens of billions more through 22 competitive grant 
programs. The dollar amounts and the pace at which they are going out 
is unprecedented.
    The stakes are high to get this money out the door quickly to 
states, local governments, transit agencies, airports, ports, and 
passenger and freight railroads. Inflation is causing real pain for the 
American people, with ongoing supply chain woes adding to the 
challenge. There may not be a magic bullet to eliminate these problems 
overnight, but infrastructure has historically proven to be a solid 
investment in our nation, and today better roads and bridges, more 
efficient railroads and ports, and fewer bottlenecks are more important 
than ever.
    So while many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
choose to use every opportunity to criticize the White House on our 
common challenges, the truth is almost none of them voted for this 
bill. They all had an opportunity to vote for a piece of legislation 
that is not about massive federal programs. Instead, these are programs 
where the vast majority of the money flows from Congress, passes 
through the U.S. DOT to states and local governments, and lands at 
private sector construction and engineering firms, and the workers they 
hire, to build physical assets. IIJA funding will provide jobs in the 
near term in the transportation construction, transit, trucking, 
aviation, rail, and maritime sectors. And the projects the bill funds 
will bolster our economy, mobility, and quality of life in the long 
term.
    But IIJA represents more than just a call to keep things humming 
along. Business as usual, or Eisenhower 8.0 as I have said repeatedly, 
was not going to cut it to address climate change and reduce carbon 
pollution. It was not going to improve safety or equity outcomes on our 
transportation networks. IIJA ushered in the first-ever federal highway 
grant funding directed at reducing carbon pollution, at reconnecting 
communities, and at vulnerable road users with a focus on the dangers 
of road design.
    These and other programs and policy changes are now in the hands of 
U.S. DOT to execute. I applaud the Department's efforts to date on this 
front as well. The steps you have taken to prioritize equity 
considerations in grants, the implementation of the Administration's 
Justice40 Initiative, and ongoing work to ensure Disadvantaged Business 
Enterprises reap the benefits of IIJA funding are examples of making 
equity outcomes matter. Issuing the National Roadway Safety Strategy 
demonstrates that this DOT is serious about addressing the recent spike 
in traffic deaths, which includes a disproportionate increase for 
pedestrians and cyclists.
    And you have taken actions to ensure that the carbon pollution 
reduction provisions of the IIJA are not just words on the page. By 
encouraging states--that's right, encouraging, not mandating or 
penalizing or taking away decision-making authority from states--to 
evaluate and think creatively about how to maximize the efficiency of 
existing assets before adding capacity is one tool DOT has employed in 
this effort.
    I will soon be sending a letter along with many of my colleagues to 
DOT in support of the Federal Highway Administration's proposed rule to 
track GHG emissions from on-road sources on the National Highway 
System, and to require state DOTs and metropolitan planning 
organizations to set declining emissions targets. This is another 
necessary step in addressing the climate crisis, as we can't improve 
what we can't measure.
    Finally, I'll say to the critics of this Administration, who say 
that your actions are carrying out House ideas from the INVEST Act--our 
transportation system's shortcomings, our planet's challenges, and the 
need for a response can't be ignored or wished away. Coming to the same 
conclusion after reviewing the same set of facts doesn't mean 
collusion. Given our current reality, taking action to evolve how we 
move people and goods is responsible and appropriate--and that is what 
this administration is doing. I commend the steady hand with which you, 
Mr. Secretary, are guiding the implementation of this bill to date, to 
deliver for the American people.
    Thank you, and I look forward to the testimony and today's 
discussion.

    Mr. DeFazio. So, with that said, I would now yield to the 
ranking member.
    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for 
calling this hearing. And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being 
here today.
    Since you last testified before the committee, Congress did 
pass the $1.2 trillion infrastructure package. And although 
many Members on my side of the aisle voted against it, it was 
mostly because there was no Republican input, and then 
ultimately no House input in the bill. Having said that, I do 
recognize it is now the law of the land, and I respect that 
fact.
    My focus now is going to be on oversight of the law and 
ensuring that it is implemented efficiently, effectively, and 
adheres to the letter of the law.
    And why is this important? Because our Nation is dealing 
with crisis after crisis, from a spending crisis to an energy 
crisis. We have a supply chain crisis, a workforce shortage 
crisis, and all of these problems are feeding into a historic 
inflation crisis. And it is astounding that inflation has 
increased 550 percent.
    Americans know that they can no longer buy the same amount 
of food or gasoline or other necessities with their hard-earned 
dollars, as they could just 1\1/2\ years ago. Obviously, not by 
a longshot.
    And the same holds true for our infrastructure dollars. 
Committee Republicans heard some pretty grim warnings last week 
during our roundtable on inflation. Companies working in the 
transportation space are struggling with exploding costs across 
the board, and some of these companies can't shoulder the risk 
of inflation, which means some of the businesses, especially 
smaller ones, are unable to even bid on some of the jobs.
    At the same time, States are running over their 
transportation budgets, as they have the impossible task of 
estimating project costs, which are going to continue to 
increase exponentially.
    In my home State of Missouri, they are estimating that they 
are going to go $140 million over budget in the current year's 
transportation plan.
    States are also receiving fewer and fewer bids on their 
projects. With all the regulatory redtape, they aren't able to 
get through the process in time for a company's proposal to 
stay true to their original estimated cost. And that is why it 
is incumbent upon the Department and Congress to make sure that 
every single dollar from the law counts and is directed towards 
projects safely and efficiently to move people, to move goods, 
and clear the bottlenecks that are adding to the supply chain 
crisis.
    However, many stakeholders have already expressed concerns 
about the administration's implementation of the infrastructure 
law, and I share some of those concerns.
    Just to highlight a few, one of the concerns to me and many 
others is December 16th of last year--the Federal Highway 
Administration guidance memo. Mr. Secretary, I know that you 
have spoken about some of the concerns raised since this 
guidance was issued, but I hope you recognize the fact that it 
remains a serious source of concern and confusion because it 
pushes the administration's own priorities, including a bias 
against adding new highway capacity over what is written in the 
law itself.
    Another related concern I have is the number of the 
Department's competitive grant notices that also include 
language doubling down on the Federal Highway Administration's 
guidance. The notices for grant programs like the INFRA, RAISE, 
Mega, Rural, and Reconnecting Communities grants. They all 
clearly show that the administration isn't as laser-focused as 
it needs to be on fundamental transportation policy and 
projects that actually improve mobility.
    One additional concern I want to highlight is in regard to 
the One Federal Decision provisions, which were included in the 
law and are critical to cutting the redtape for so many of the 
projects. Instead of simply implementing the OFD provisions, 
the administration released its action plan on project 
permitting on May 11th, and it doesn't seem to mention OFD. So, 
again, here is another example of the law laying out an 
explicit policy, which the administration appears to be 
ignoring in favor of accelerating projects that fit its own 
agenda.
    The result of the administration putting its agenda ahead 
of the law of the land, and even acting in contradiction to the 
law in some cases, is that infrastructure funding--already 
dramatically devalued by this crippling inflation, as has been 
pointed out--is being diluted even further. This is not shaping 
up to be the infrastructure bill that Americans were promised. 
And now more than ever this administration needs to focus on 
real infrastructure and on policies that can get us out of so 
many of these crises.
    So, with that, I do want to thank the chairman again for 
holding this hearing.

    The same holds true for our infrastructure dollars.

    Mr. Graves of Missouri. And thank you very much, Mr. 
Secretary. I know you are busy, but coming before Congress, it 
does mean a lot to a lot of Members. Thanks.
    Mr. DeFazio. I thank the ranking member.
    Now I would like to formally recognize the Honorable Pete 
Buttigieg, Secretary of Transportation. Thanks again for 
joining us today. I look forward to your testimony.
    And without objection, our witness' full statement will be 
included in the record. And since your written testimony is 
made a part of the record, the committee requests that you

    With that, you may proceed.

TESTIMONY OF HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION, 
               U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

    Secretary Buttigieg. Good morning, and thank you very much, 
Chair DeFazio. Thank you, Ranking Member Graves. And thank you, 
members of the committee, for the opportunity to join you this 
morning.
    Before I begin, I wanted in particular to recognize you, 
Chair DeFazio, for 36 years of extraordinary service, and to 
congratulate you on your upcoming retirement.
    There are few who can claim to have done more than you to 
champion safety, to promote environmental justice, and to 
advance transportation systems to benefit all Americans.
    I also want to acknowledge that earlier this year we lost a 
Member and former chair of this committee, the late 
Representative Don Young, who represented the people of Alaska 
for nearly half a century and was often willing to cross the 
aisle to get things done for the American people.
    Thanks to leaders like Chair DeFazio, Representative Young, 
and so many of you, we now have the most transformative 
transportation investment in most of our lifetimes, in the form 
of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. And it couldn't 
have come at a more important time. From delays at ports to 
freight congestion to shortages in aviation, American 
transportation has rarely confronted this many intersecting 
challenges at once, both immediate and entrenched. Nearly 
43,000 people died in traffic crashes last year, each of them a 
parent or child, colleague or friend.
    Transportation produces more carbon emissions than any 
other sector at a time when the nations of the world are 
rallying to confront the climate challenge. And as Americans 
grapple with the effects of inflation, we know that 
transportation is the second largest household expense after 
housing, affecting every family budget.
    This is also, though, a moment of enormous opportunity, 
with reason for optimism. Thanks to the infrastructure law, my 
Department has never seen a moment of greater potential than 
now to build transportation resources that connect everyone 
safely, efficiently, and affordably to the things we need and 
the people we love.
    Needless to say, we have been busy. We have already 
announced nearly $84 billion in grant funding from across the 
Department. Every few days, we have another great announcement: 
Bridge repair programs that will help us move more goods more 
affordably and people more safely, a national electric vehicle 
charging network with the potential to bring cost-saving 
technology to rural communities and help fight the climate 
crisis, and safety initiatives that will reduce crashes and 
save lives; for example, getting rid of outdated railroad 
crossings to prevent tragedies like the one we saw recently in 
Chariton County.
    Ranking Member Graves, my thoughts are with all of your 
constituents, the passengers, the families, who were impacted 
by that derailment. And I want to emphasize that DOT will 
continue to support NTSB's investigation and work to improve 
railroad safety nationwide.
    From safety to reliability to affordability, name a 
dimension of transportation that you deal with in daily life; 
we have a program addressing it. All of this is going to help 
people get where they need to go while creating jobs and 
economic opportunity across the country.
    You all know better than anyone that passing the law is 
only the first step. Success means delivering good projects 
that improve the lives of your constituents.
    I will give you just a few examples of the work we are 
supporting. Alpena, Michigan, is a community of fewer than 
10,000 people where one of the largest employers is the local 
cement plant. We awarded the city funding to modernize their 
port so it can bring in larger cargo ships. That means more 
business for the plant, more jobs for the people of Alpena, and 
better access to materials for manufacturers across the region.
    Within the city limits of Baltimore, it can take hours to 
get from home to work if you don't have a car. So, we are 
funding 10 new miles of dedicated bus lanes to connect 
residential neighborhoods with major employers in a single 
corridor that supports more than 180,000 jobs.
    In 2007, Findlay, Ohio--a town of 40,000--flooded. Hundreds 
of homes and businesses were damaged or forced to move. Now we 
are helping Findlay replace a century-old railroad bridge with 
a modern ballast deck bridge that will not only help people get 
to work but also reduce the risk of flooding damage in the 
future.
    And these are just a sample from among literally thousands 
of projects that will help Americans live and work where they 
want, help businesses deliver better products, and help 
families save for the future. It can even save lives.
    In this good work, we will need your continued leadership 
and partnership, as well as that of communities across the 
country, organized labor, businesses, State, Tribal, and local 
officials, and so many more. Together, we have the opportunity 
to improve countless lives, support good-paying jobs, 
strengthen America's manufacturers, modernize our 
infrastructure for decades to come, and cement America's 
position as the world's leading economy.
    So, thank you once more for inviting me to be here today, 
and I am looking forward to addressing your questions.

    Thank you once more for inviting me to be here today. I look 
forward to your questions.

    Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I will now move on 
to questions. I will first recognize the chair of the Highways 
and Transit Subcommittee, Eleanor Holmes Norton, for her 
questions. Eleanor will be virtual.
    Ms. Norton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank 
you, Mr. Buttigieg, for being here today.
    As you know, the Department of Transportation grant 
recipients have historically been prohibited from utilizing 
geographic or economic or other hiring preferences regarding 
the use of labor for DOT-funded transportation projects.
    But the new infrastructure law provided new statutory 
authority for recipients of DOT grants to utilize local labor 
hiring preferences. We call them local hires on construction 
contracts. I do support this authority.
    As a former mayor yourself, can you explain what this new 
authority means for cities and other grant recipients carrying 
out infrastructure projects? For example, are grant recipients 
required to utilize local hiring preferences?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, thank you very much. As both 
Secretary and as mayor, I have heard too often stories from 
neighborhoods that have long craved some kind of infrastructure 
investment finally see it, only for residents to look at the 
worksite and wonder if any of the people getting the good-
paying jobs, working on that project, come from anywhere near 
the area where the project is being done.
    But as you mentioned earlier, our ability to support that 
kind of work was restricted to pilot programs. Using the 
authority provided for us in the new law, we will be able to 
support local hiring provisions to the extent they are 
supported on the ground in ways that we think are going to 
contribute enormously to opportunity in communities that 
perhaps in the past have been left out of the good-paying job 
creation and the ladders to the middle class that come with it.
    And so, we will continue using the authorities provided in 
the law to support that kind of work and support that extension 
of access to opportunity for so many who have not felt that 
they have been part of it in administrations or in years past.
    Ms. Norton. Well, they can use local hiring preferences. 
Are they required to use local hiring preferences?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I am sorry. Could you repeat the 
question?
    Ms. Norton. Are grant recipients required to utilize local 
hiring preferences?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, we encourage local hire. It 
depends of course on the program, but Federal-aid highway 
programming now paves the way for grant recipients to do so, 
and we will be working with them every step of the way.
    Ms. Norton. OK. I will be encouraging my transportation 
authority to require local hiring preferences.
    I would like to ask you about Union Station here in the 
District of Columbia. The Federal Railroad Administration 
recently revised its proposal to develop Union Station. I 
appreciate the renewed focus on better serving transit, rail, 
bus riders, along with cyclists that are provided in this 
proposal.
    But it is also critical to ensure that Union Station design 
works for DC residents who rely on local transit, food, and 
retail options, and who will be impacted on a daily basis by 
changes in traffic patterns in the area.
    What is your Department doing to engage with local 
residents about the project and to account for their needs and 
suggestions going forward?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, as your question importantly 
notes, there are many modes of transportation that converge at 
Union Station. And while it is certainly known partly for its 
role in intercity rail and longer distance travel, it is also 
very significant as a hub for transit and as a retail site that 
is very meaningful for the immediate neighborhood, both in 
terms of access to retail and in terms of access to jobs.
    So, we consider it very important, as we would in any 
project, but certainly with all of the overlapping equities 
here, for the voices of community members to be heard. I know 
that is expressed partly through you and through your office, 
but also expect for there to be immediate means of input. And 
we will work with the project sponsor and knowing that the 
District of Columbia, of course, is very hands-on with this, to 
make sure that we support that kind of participation and that 
all those relevant concerns are heard.
    Ms. Norton. Thank you.
    Mr. DeFazio. I thank the gentlelady.
    I now turn to Ranking Member Sam Graves.
    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My 
question is actually fairly simple, because one of the things I 
am concerned about and have been pretty active in over the 
years is trying to figure out how we make the Highway Trust 
Fund solvent.
    We have obviously got a lot of vehicles on the road that 
aren't paying for the use of the road. Again, it is something I 
have been pretty active in, and I know there was an alternative 
funding board I think that was put in the infrastructure plan. 
I am just curious how that is coming along.
    And I know we had some pilot projects going on out there, 
too, some VMT pilot projects and a few things. I don't know. We 
are not talking about that anymore, and I know it is a 
monumental task when it is eventually going to have to be 
tackled to figure that out. But just curious on your thoughts 
and where we are in that process and how those pilots are 
going.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. Yes. There were the pilots 
that were authorized previously through the FAST Act. A number 
of States have pursued them, and we are always interested in 
their experience and trying to get information about the 
results there. Further pilots are provided for in the IIJA, and 
we will support that work as well.
    I think ultimately there are some profound policy 
considerations that will need to be addressed in terms of the 
long-term viability of the Highway Trust Fund. And, as you 
know, for the IIJA, it was very important to this 
administration not to take any step that would be inconsistent 
with the President's commitment not to raise taxes on anybody 
making less than----
    Mr. Graves of Missouri [interposing]. And I understand 
that.
    Secretary Buttigieg [continuing]. $400,000 a year. But in 
some way, shape, or form, we need to be prepared for a model of 
sustainable highway trust funding that is different from the 
one that we have inherited.
    And as these pilots continue to take shape--and we can 
update your office on the Federal kind of side in terms of how 
we are laying the groundwork for that pursuant to IIJA--I think 
it will give us some important data points that we are going to 
need, especially if Congress decides for the long run that it 
is not as prepared as it has been in the past to commit general 
fund dollars to that purpose.
    Mr. Graves of Missouri. And we are going to continue to 
pull general fund dollars in. And I worry about that, the 
precedent that it sets. In transportation, we have always tried 
to be a pay-as-you-go and a fee-based process, and I am 
concerned about, you know, just the movement away from that. 
But it is a concern. Thanks.
    I yield back.
    Mr. DeFazio. OK. I thank the gentleman.
    Now Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson.
    Ms. Johnson of Texas. Yes. Thank you very much, and let me 
thank the Secretary for making himself available and for the 
job he is doing on behalf of the administration.
    And I want to thank you for visiting Dallas-Fort Worth, but 
you only saw two programs, so, I hope you will be coming back 
soon.
    It is critically important to make sure that everyone is 
benefitting from this legislation. So, could you discuss what 
the Federal DOT is doing to ensure that disadvantaged business 
programs are working properly and are guaranteeing the 
minority- and women-owned businesses are getting a fair share 
of these transportation dollars?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, thank you for the question. This 
is very important to us. It is, of course, the rationale for 
the DBE programs that are provided for in the law, and also 
just an essential matter of fairness in terms of the business 
opportunity that parallels, in my view, the need for fairness 
in labor opportunity that was at stake in the question that 
Representative Norton asked earlier.
    In order to make good on that, we have been actively 
working not just to ensure that there is compliance with the 
DBE law, but in order to make sure that we are better alerting 
the DBE community to the business opportunities that it might 
create. For example, our Office of Small and Disadvantaged 
Business Utilization has been preparing events around the 
country to help bring together officials and contractors to 
preview the opportunities and get a better sense of how to 
compete for those opportunities.
    We know that----
    Mr. DeFazio [interrupting]. If the gentleman would suspend 
for 1 second. I believe someone's microphone is on, and I 
believe it might be Eleanor Holmes Norton. Please mute your 
microphones.
    Continue, Mr. Secretary.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. We recognize that our 
processes need to be user-friendly, especially if we are trying 
to expand the base of historically excluded business owners who 
have access to these Federal opportunities. And so, we will be 
working with the States, the transit agencies, and others who 
are being funded, while also making sure that we meet our own 
ambitious goals for direct Federal procurement, which have been 
increased this year on the SDB side to 20 percent.
    And making sure that we are meeting our goals in-house I 
think will also give us important expertise and experience, 
which will be relevant for us to work with the States and the 
other partners on for the effective inclusion of various 
businesses and opportunities created by the bill writ large.
    Ms. Johnson of Texas. Well, thank you very much. Now, I 
know that this is not important to a lot of people, but cities 
that were impacted by highways, and disadvantaged communities 
are really concerned about it--and some smaller ones, I might 
add--as we look around the country.
    But I am hoping that we will provide some robust funding 
for Reconnecting Communities. I know that in my district, in 
Dallas, Texas, right in the downtown areas, we have at least 
two major areas. And so, I am hoping that there will be some 
attention given to those important reconnections.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, thank you. We had the great 
pleasure of rolling out the Reconnecting Communities Program 
recently in Birmingham and have seen just enormous interest 
around the country in knitting together places that have been 
separated or divided by a piece of infrastructure, be it a 
railway, a highway, an interchange, or something else.
    I think that we will learn a great deal through this first-
ever round of applications coming in, and we recognize that the 
program will very likely be oversubscribed, that we will get 
more than $200 million worth of applications this first year, 
but also hope in the work that we will be able to fund to light 
the way for what jurisdictions may be able to do with their own 
dollars, even if not earmarked for this purpose, knowing that 
that benefits the entire community with better transportation 
networks while also addressing some of the harms that had been 
created by choices in the past.
    Ms. Johnson of Texas. Thank you very much, and thank you, 
Mr. Chair. I think my time has just about expired.
    Mr. DeFazio. OK. I thank the gentlelady, and now 
Representative Crawford.
    Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. 
Secretary, for being here. Continuing off that theme, you 
recently announced a $1 billion program aimed at combatting 
alleged racism in road projects. At the same time, DOT is 
actively supporting the construction of the doomed California 
high-speed rail project, despite reports that indicate the 
project is in fact displacing and destroying low-income 
minority communities in the track's path. So, my question is, 
why are you dismantling existing highways in the name of racial 
equity while you're also supporting a project that's actively 
harming low-income minority communities?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, every project has an impact, and 
what we think the law provides for is a process for local 
communities to weigh in on how those impacts affect them, and 
unless there is a civil rights violation, in which case, my 
Department of course will very proactively address it, then it 
falls to the project sponsor to decide how to balance those 
concerns.
    But in terms of the highway work, the way I view it is, if 
Federal dollars were ever used in a way that separates or 
segregates, then a pretty good use of Federal dollars now would 
be to connect to address those harms, and my view also is that 
the entire community, not just those who were disadvantaged, is 
better off when a community is served by transportation 
infrastructure that does in fact connect more than it divides.
    Mr. Crawford. Well, that sounds pretty good rhetorically, 
but in reality what we know is that this money pit in 
California, that's largely being subsidized by Federal tax 
dollars is doing exactly what you purport to prevent with this 
$1 billion allocation.
    So, I think that is worth revisiting at some point to 
determine if in fact that's--certainly that's happening, is 
that a good expenditure of money? But let me move on in the 
interest of time.
    Ranking Member Graves mentioned a 550-percent increase in 
inflation since your boss took office that's wreaking havoc on 
our economy, it's destroying particularly transportation 
businesses, that includes the small suppliers and the 
disadvantaged business enterprises that work in that space. 
Companies just can't afford the cashflow this increased 
inflation, to shoulder that risk, and what's worse is it's 
creating a vacuum in the marketplace that allows for foreign 
companies to come in and further decimate U.S. industries and 
economies. So, my question is, can DOT provide guidance to 
States and other recipients that inflation adjustments are 
required in transportation contracts?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, cost containment is a major focus 
for us right now in implementing the law, because we're hearing 
this from both project sponsors and the business community. The 
impact of cost escalation and inflation is unquestionably going 
to reflect our ability to deliver.
    I'm less sure that this is something that would put U.S. 
companies at a disadvantage to international companies for the 
simple reason that inflation is international. I was just in 
Germany a few months ago. Inflation there is somewhere around 8 
or 9 percent. So, a German company I imagine would face the 
same kind of cost escalation as a U.S. company.
    Mr. Crawford. With respect, I'm less concerned about a 
German company and more concerned about a Chinese company which 
subsidize at a much, much higher rate than anybody else, and 
they do that obviously for reasons to disrupt our economy and 
to jeopardize our national security. So, that's my focus there 
is to make sure we're not creating an opportunity for Chinese 
SOEs to come in and occupy space that should be occupied by 
U.S. businesses, and particularly these DBEs that we're trying 
to ensure have an opportunity to perform in that marketplace, 
but let me move on. Has DOT performed a legal analysis to see 
what is possible?
    Secretary Buttigieg. To see what is possible to address 
inflation?
    Mr. Crawford. Sure.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Sure. We're looking at it every day. 
We don't need a legal analysis to tell us that we've got to 
make sure that there is access to----
    Mr. Crawford [interrupting]. I'm talking about a 
contracting process.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Do you mean in terms of imposing a new 
requirement on the States?
    Mr. Crawford. Yes.
    Secretary Buttigieg. I have not addressed imposing 
additional requirements on the States for this purpose, but we 
can certainly look into that if you wish.
    Mr. Crawford. So, what I'm asking is for contract reviews 
to address inflation, has there been a legal analysis there? 
Because we--when this was implemented, and we've seen inflation 
continue on an upwards trajectory, and there were no provisions 
offered to address that. And so, we're seeing that it's very, 
very difficult for companies to maintain pace with this rate of 
inflation.
    So, I guess what I'm asking is, are contracts firm? Are 
they fixed? Or are there any provisions in place for them to 
address that inflation?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, often, contracts will have a 
contingency factor that can affect any unanticipated pressure 
on prices.
    Mr. Crawford. And in this case, do they have a contingency 
factor?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Again, it would depend on the specific 
program involved, but I would certainly welcome a chance to 
work with your office to see if you agree that that's 
adequately contemplated in the contract framework.
    Mr. Crawford. Are any other provisions being discussed 
about what DOT can do to help small businesses and DBEs 
continue to participate in this market?
    Secretary Buttigieg. A couple of things that we think can 
be helpful here. One, of course, is simply doing everything we 
can to ensure that projects move forward swiftly, right? The 
greater the rate of inflation, the greater the cost of delay. 
And so, as we're looking at everything from technical 
assistance to support moving through the permitting process, 
that's something that becomes even more important in a high 
inflation environment.
    Other mechanisms that I think could make a difference here 
are ones that could look at the timing of the spikes that you 
see in the costs of some of the different inputs, not that you 
can predict the divergence between, let's say, the cost of 
steel and the cost of labor 3 years from now. But there may be 
ways to help project sponsors like transit agencies or State 
highway departments at least map out where some of the bulges 
are likeliest to occur in the availability or the restriction 
of supply, and I think that could make a difference, too. So, 
that's an example of the kind of thing we're exploring with 
them as we partner to try to make sure we get the absolute most 
value for these taxpayer dollars.
    Mr. Crawford. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. DeFazio. I thank the gentleman. We now turn to 
Representative Larsen.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. 
Secretary, I have a very Washington State focused question to 
start, and it has to do with the culvert funding we passed, an 
$800 million program as part of the IIJA that included 
contributions from State, local, and Tribal governments to 
replace culverts. It's a big issue in our State, and when can 
we expect information about the IIJA culvert funding program?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, we're hard at work on this. It is 
new territory for us in many regards, so, we've been working 
with interagency partners like the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service 
and others. I've told my team I'd like to see this guidance out 
by the time the salmon are finished running, and hopefully 
it'll be before the peak. So, that's the best timeframe I can 
give you. Late summer is really the goal.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. There may be no salmon running at 
all if we don't get the culvert funding out.
    Secretary Buttigieg. We're hard at work on it.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. I understand, and I wanted to 
underline that for us in the Northwest. Thanks so much. 
Changing the direction a little bit, one aspect of the equity 
question, we've been exploring equity issues in my district and 
throughout the country, and there's a lot of variety in how 
people define ``equity'' and so on, but there are aspects of 
it.
    One issue has to do with equity and data collection. If we 
don't collect good data, then we don't really know specifically 
the impacts on some communities, making it impossible for DOT 
to factor that into community efforts to address inequity. So, 
how have you used data collection for underrepresented groups, 
and how is that factored into the equity action plan on the 
DOT?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, what we're trying to do is strike 
the right balance between gathering enough data to set good 
policy and know how we're doing as far as the effects, 
benefits, and impacts of our policies and projects on 
disadvantaged communities, without creating such a burdensome 
framework for data collection that it's actually low-income 
communities or small rural communities. In other words, the 
ones we'd most want to help from an equity perspective that 
find it prohibitive to apply for projects or participate in our 
processes.
    I think that balance leaves room for us to gather data at a 
more granular level, though, and I think we have a 
responsibility to do that. We still have relatively little 
visibility, for example, on who gets the economic benefit of 
the dollars once they go out of our building, so to speak, and 
I think that especially given what technology now makes 
possible in terms of managing this data, we're in a position 
to--in what I hope will be an administratively lightweight 
fashion--gather more information than we've ever had, and use 
that for decision support.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. There are many examples, Puget 
Sound Regional Council has a data tracker on equity that we can 
pass on to you that we're looking at, but related to this issue 
of equity in small rural communities, which I also represent--
we've got a big variety in my district--and one of the 
challenges that I have and we shared with Mayor Landrieu as 
well is just the lack of capacity to apply for competitive 
grants. Competitive grants that are called rural transportation 
grants, and they just aren't at the capacity to get their arms 
around that. Has the DOT thought through this problem? Because 
I know Mayor Landrieu has heard of this issue throughout the 
implementation phase.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Yes. At least two things I can point 
to that we're doing about this. It resembles my own experience 
as a mayor who led a city that didn't necessarily have the 
resources for a robust Federal affairs team, and their 
community is much smaller than my hometown of South Bend trying 
to get access here.
    The first is to make the processes simpler on the front 
end. So, when you see us taking a step like a combined Notice 
of Funding Opportunity that rolls INFRA, and Mega, and the 
Rural Surface Transportation program into one, part of what 
we're trying to do is just have literally fewer pages of paper 
out there in the process so that it is easier to navigate for 
an applicant of any size.
    The second thing is to make sure that we're proactively 
engaging project sponsors or would-be project sponsors, and 
where possible--and we do have some funding for this; there's 
always going to be more demand than we can support--the kind of 
direct technical assistance that can help walk them through the 
process, especially when you're looking at a first-time 
applicant.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thanks, and then on workforce 
issues and equity, perhaps you've touched on this with 
discussion on DBE, and you have in some respects, but are there 
other steps that DOT is taking to ensure that minority-owned 
businesses are in fact considered for and selected for these 
projects?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Quite a few, and part of how I view 
this is that it's not only a matter of fairness, although 
that's reason enough, but also the volume and the pace of 
infrastructure work we're taking on as a country is going to 
demand everything that we can provide as a country as far as 
talent, entrepreneurial talents, and skilled work. And what 
that means is that we can't succeed if we leave any talent on 
the table.
    And so, as you look across our programs, some of them can 
directly support workforce development in a way that we think 
benefits both labor and DBE ownership. Some of it doesn't 
require that, but certainly leaves space for project sponsors 
to do so, and the effects are----
    Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. Can I stop you 
there? Because I want to respect the 5-minute rule before the 
chair makes me respect the 5-minute rule. But I'll follow up 
with your staff with the rest of the answer. Thanks.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you.
    Mr. DeFazio. I thank the gentleman.
    Representative Gibbs.
    Mr. Gibbs. Thank you. Mr. Secretary, just to follow up a 
little bit on Congressman Crawford's questions. My 
understanding is the Federal Transit Administration recently 
put out guidance through at least one of their regional offices 
that suggests transit grant recipients, through OMB 
regulations, are allowed to use Federal resources to help cover 
material cost increases for previously negotiated contracts. 
Have similar memos gone out for highway and other offices?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I would have to get back to you on 
mode by mode how each of the different operating 
administrations is trying to accommodate those things that are 
taking place, but----
    Mr. Gibbs [interrupting]. But you can concur that the 
Federal Transit Administration has done that?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I'll make sure, but I certainly don't 
know anything that would contradict that.
    Mr. Gibbs. OK. Thank you. Also, do you agree that investing 
in Federal port infrastructure and improving efficiency, 
including automation and new technologies, would help improve 
port operations and relieve supply chain bottlenecks?
    Secretary Buttigieg. We strongly believe in funding port 
infrastructure that will make a positive difference to both the 
port's ability to move goods and to the surrounding 
communities.
    Mr. Gibbs. Are you aware that there are currently 
restrictions on using Federal dollars for these purposes, for 
automation and basically automation infrastructure?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, as you likely know, there is a lot 
of difference of opinion and difference in the research on 
where automation in fact yields to productivity increases, and 
where it doesn't, and there's quite a bit of skepticism about 
how that could work in the U.S. context.
    That said, there are so many things that we can invest in, 
and are investing in that unquestionably benefit the efficiency 
and the throughput of ports. For example, with the Port 
Infrastructure Development Program in the last round, we sent 
about $52 million to Long Beach. That's going to allow them to 
build about 10,000 additional feet of on-dock rail, which helps 
you without having to wait for a chassis or have the truck go 
between, and get those containers on their way, and we're going 
to continue to look for ways to support throughput, again, 
hopefully in a fashion that also benefits the surrounding 
community.
    Mr. Gibbs. Well, I would think that sometimes there's some 
resistance to automation and new technologies because of labor 
issues and all that, and now that you think of it, if 
historically, where would be in the agricultural community if 
we resisted automation? Where would we be if we protected the 
phone operators back in the 1970s when the new technologies 
that came up out from that? So, I think historically technology 
is--and maybe jobs have gone by the wayside, but the result is 
different, new jobs, and higher paying jobs for improving the 
standard of living.
    So, I think that's a thing to keep in the back of your head 
that automation is sometimes tough, but it's usually the 
correct way to go, at least historically and across many 
sectors of our economy.
    You may be aware that pipelines are among the safest and 
most efficient, environmentally friendly ways to transport 
energy. Yet, I'm concerned about this administration's anti-
energy agenda at a time when gas prices and inflation have 
reached all-time highs. Congress back in 2020 passed bipartisan 
legislation to boost pipeline safety and efficiency. Can you 
please provide us an update on the implementation of this law 
that was passed 2 years ago?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. PHMSA has been hard at work 
making sure the provisions of the PIPES Act are enacted, both 
in terms of making sure that we have the right kind of staffing 
to support it, and the rulemakings that are called for in the 
legislation. I would be happy to get you more details, but the 
bottom line is that we will continue to meet our safety 
mission, whatever other policy questions are being debated, and 
PHMSA has taken a number of steps to, I believe, enhance--even 
just in the time since the legislation was passed--to enhance 
our already very strong track record in terms of pipe safety 
oversight.
    Mr. Gibbs. Yes, and I realize in your purview, safety is in 
your jurisdiction, but I don't think there's been really any 
pipelines permitted in this administration, might not come 
under your purview, might come under the Army Corps or the EPA, 
but restricting this pipeline permitting access expiration in 
the United States is limiting our exploration and our ability 
to produce more energy, because if you don't have the pipelines 
to put the natural gas in, they can't produce the wells. And 
so, I'll just make that comment.
    Also, the Maritime Administration permits for deepwater 
ports, that's the only thing they grant permits for. There's 
been a release of an environmental impact statement, and I 
understand the first release of the draft environmental impact 
statement was to provide multiple language information to 
nearby communities, even though such information had already 
been provided in the original DEIS.
    I guess I'd ask this administration if they meet all their 
permits, the applicant, if all the environmental requirements 
are met, will the Maritime Administration provide a positive 
record of decision on this?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, once applicants have fully 
satisfied the requirements of EIS, then the deepwater port can 
be licensed. I can tell you in the last 3 years, MARAD has 
engaged over 20 companies with interest in developing new 
facilities with 8 deepwater export applications that came in 
during that time. I believe two of those were withdrawn, but 
the remaining six are under review, and we'll review them 
according to the responsibilities that MARAD has under the law.
    Mr. Gibbs. I just hope that they meet the requirements, and 
they are approved. Thank you, I yield back.
    Mr. DeFazio. I thank the gentleman. I will now turn to 
Representative Napolitano.
    Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Secretary, I 
thank you for announcing the funding opportunity for a Railroad 
Crossing Elimination Program. Funding is incredibly important 
to my district, and the money for the grade separations is 
significant, but just as significant is the effective 
coordination between Government sponsors and the private 
railroad companies who can hold up those projects with 
excessive requirements, unnecessary private railroad 
improvements on taxpayer dime, and delays. How is the 
Department ensuring that railroad companies and all 
stakeholders are effective partners to quickly implement 
railroad grade separation projects?
    Secondly, I greatly appreciate the administration's 
Justice40 initiative that directs 40 percent of Federal funds 
to disadvantaged communities. Is the Justice40 initiative being 
implemented for all your grant programs, and in particular, 
your transit Capital Investment Grant Program?
    And one more question. I'm very proud to have Foothill 
Transit in my district, leading the Nation for more than a 
decade in electric and fuel zero-emission buses, and has 
invited you to visit the facilities.
    I extended an invitation to you personally in the letter 
that I just handed you. Since zero-emission buses are new 
technology, how is FTA working with experienced agencies like 
Foothill Transit to ensure information and best practices are 
shared among transit agencies as they receive infrastructure 
law funding for zero-emission buses?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. I'll try to--let me try to 
take those in reverse order. So, with regard to zero-emission 
buses, we recognize there are a lot of agencies like Foothill 
Transit that already have quite a bit of expertise in this 
regard, and we want to make sure that that's taken on board.
    So, FTA is doing a lot of convening through efforts like 
the Transit Vehicle Innovation Deployment Centers initiative to 
try to bring the different players together, and actually I 
believe Foothill Transit was among the agencies on an advisory 
panel in a position to share their expertise on this, because 
we do need to make sure that more agencies understand and are 
equipped to take advantage of the funding, and to make these 
clean vehicle deployments that are going to be so important for 
their future.
    With regard to Justice40, I can tell you that the entire 
$20 billion per year programming of the FTA supports equity in 
transportation, and this can take different forms, and I think 
the formal criteria and guidance related to Justice40 is still 
being framed up at the interagency level, but we're certainly 
not waiting to take actions that are going to meet those goals, 
knowing that so many of the communities that are overburdened 
and underserved are also those that stand to gain the most from 
having excellent, convenient, accessible, and clean 
transportation brought to them, and the economic opportunity 
that comes with it.
    And then on the rail grade crossings, this is an issue that 
we're hearing about from communities in every part of the 
country of every size, and we consider it very important, not 
only from a safety perspective, of course, but also as we 
discuss issues like more fluid movement of goods and cargo. 
This is certainly a concern, because those at-grade crossings 
are associated with slow orders and other measures for safety 
purposes that wind up impacting the fluidity of the overall 
system.
    So, we're very pleased to have now the dedicated Railroad 
Crossing Elimination Program in addition to other rail funding 
like CRISI that can help in this regard, and FRA is very 
actively engaging all of the different players, communities, 
railroads, and any other interested stakeholders on how to make 
sure that this can be effectively used. It can be challenging 
because sometimes there is an infrastructure owner that is 
different than the project sponsor. You imagine a city coming 
to the table wanting to get rid of an at-grade crossing needing 
to engage with a railroad that actually has the asset. And so, 
we're doing what we can to try to make sure that there's the 
right communication so that these applicants can be successful.
    Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you very much. The fact is that the 
railroads have been good partners in my area, but they still 
don't provide the funding necessary to complete the project, or 
at least be a partner with the State and the Fed. And then on 
the grant program, how about the transit Capital Investment 
Grant Program?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Sorry, what about the Capital 
Investment Grant Program?
    Mrs. Napolitano. That was on the Justice40.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Yes. So, I can tell you that the whole 
intent of the transit programming writ-large is of course to 
connect people to opportunity into where they need to be, and 
the kinds of communities that Justice40 is looking at are often 
those that stand to gain a great deal by the work that's being 
done in CIG. And so, again what I'd emphasize is, even in those 
areas that may or may not fit the formal or technical 
definition of Justice40, they will already--certainly CIG will 
already have criteria that are relevant to the spirit of that 
program.
    Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you.
    Mr. DeFazio. I thank the gentlelady. Now, Representative 
Webster.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you, Chair, and thank you, 
Secretary, for appearing. We really appreciate it. As you know, 
the revenue from the Highway Trust Fund is not sufficient to 
meet the transportation needs. And so, over the years since 
maybe 2007-2008, we've put money in, and that money is being 
spent, and it's going to be spent up again here in the next few 
years, and we'll need to do it again. And CBO estimates that in 
maybe 2026 or 2027, we'll run out of money again.
    The administration though is focusing on promoting electric 
cars and has championed a gas tax holiday. Those are things 
that take away revenue, not add to it. So, my question is, do 
you have something that wouldn't negatively affect revenue that 
we can kind of put our teeth into that would rebuild what's 
there, including maybe something that would tax electric 
vehicles?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, first of all, I do want to 
emphasize that when the President asked Congress to consider 
the gas tax holiday, he called for a means of doing it that 
would hold harmless the Highway Trust Fund, but certainly the 
larger point is well taken, that as we continue the transition 
toward electric vehicles and zero-emitting vehicles, it means 
that we're going to need to have other means for filling gaps 
in the Highway Trust Fund.
    Up until now, Congress has been prepared to do that through 
general fund transfers. That's certainly a legitimate way to 
fund our highway needs. It's not the only way, and it's not 
consistent with the past practice of a user-pays principle.
    How to enact an alternative? These are the kinds of things 
that the FAST Act law provided for exploring in the pilot; some 
States have begun doing that, and pursuant to IIJA, there can 
be more work in that regard, too. I think that will get us more 
technical insights, but I think ultimately this will be not a 
technical decision, but a policy one, and that largely comes 
down to whether Congress will continue to hold to the user-pays 
principle, or seek an alternative means for funding.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Have you considered some sort of 
toll facility which every vehicle would pay if they had to go 
through the toll booth? Is that something that's an option?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I grew up in northern Indiana where I-
80/90 is funded as a toll road, and certainly that's something 
I think we're accustomed to on certain heavily trafficked 
roads, especially if they were built or maintained with that in 
mind. I think it's tougher to imagine how that could be 
implemented on a widespread basis. And so, unless we could 
think of a non-intrusive way to do that, I think it'll be 
always something that's restricted to more specific and high 
traffic points, bridges and certain highways, than something 
that could answer how the road system writ large is funded.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. So, how about using private money 
to do that?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Using highway money to erect the toll 
booths?
    Mr. Webster of Florida. No, private money, private 
investment.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Oh, sorry, I thought you said highway 
money.
    We do think that there continues to be a place for private 
investment, and if you look at some of the work our Build 
America Bureau has done to unlock some of that private value, 
it holds a lot of promise. I would be less confident that that 
could answer a question as large scale as how to keep the 
Highway Trust Fund in order.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you very much. I yield back.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you.
    Mr. DeFazio. I thank the gentleman. Representative Cohen.
    Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Secretary, I thank you 
for coming before the committee and for your infrastructure 
remarks, recognizing the outstanding service of our chair, of 
our former chair, Mr. Young, who was a dear friend, and the 
work of this committee.
    Last time I think we spoke, you called me about supporting 
the bill from the Senate, and I told you I couldn't do it, 
because I was supportive of my chairman and the hard work of 
this committee. Forget about all that. I voted for the bill.
    We had a hearing last month on highlighting the impact of 
outdated road design and the highway safety crisis. We learned 
that speed is a factor, both in increasing the risk of crashes 
and the severity. Certain high-crash locations are responsible 
for a disproportionate number of fatalities and serious 
injuries. Memphis, unfortunately, was recently rated the third 
worst city for pedestrian injuries and accidents.
    Senator Markey and I got the Complete Streets Act passed 
and part of it got into the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act, and so, a certain percentage of money has to go toward 
those projects. How will Complete Streets planning initiatives 
included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act change 
the way we design our roadways and prioritize safety and access 
for all users over speed?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, as you correctly point out, 
speed is a factor in so many of the roadway fatalities that we 
experience in the U.S., and having an approach to road design 
that recognizes not only what's in the car, not only who is in 
the car, but the road itself and how it's designed play a major 
role in safety. We think we have a safety responsibility to 
support Complete Streets, and indeed, there are a number of 
provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, as you know, 
that encourage State, Tribal, and local governments to develop 
Complete Streets standards or policies and plans that 
prioritize Complete Streets projects.
    I would point also to the economic benefits of that. 
Certainly it was my own experience in my hometown where we 
applied what you could think of as a Complete Streets treatment 
to a downtown thoroughfare and saw a lot of benefit to small 
business from there being more foot traffic because people felt 
safer walking along the street once it had gone through those 
upgrades.
    We have delivered the report to Congress that was called 
for, called ``Moving to a Complete Streets Design Model,'' 
which offers the Federal Highway Administration's guidance and 
identifies some of the resources that can be helpful here. We 
don't aim to prescribe all of the details about what makes for 
a good Complete Street, and we know that local jurisdictions 
will come up with their own ideas, but we wanted to provide a 
framework and provide support. And I would also emphasize among 
other funding sources that would be a legitimate application 
for Complete Streets. Certainly with the Safe Streets and Roads 
for All Program, which is $1 billion annually over the next 5 
years. I think that's one area where a well-considered Complete 
Streets plan will score quite well.
    Mr. Cohen. Thank you, sir. I just hope that you would 
concentrate or put specific focus on road corridors that are 
the most serious problems based on high risk. And of course, 
that would include Memphis, but I know you'll do that.
    Kind of go to a lightning round here. Passenger rail is 
important for the people in my city and my State. We'd like to 
connect Memphis and Nashville. Those are two of the iconic 
large cities in the South that are not connected, while most 
are. Are there funds that are in the bill that would help 
Tennessee pursue intercity passenger rail service between 
Nashville and Memphis?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Certainly, the bill providing for 
greater investment in passenger rail than we've seen since the 
inception of Amtrak certainly contains funds where I would 
expect that anyone with a vision for intercity rail like that 
will be interested in applying, and we'll be interested to see 
what----
    Mr. Cohen [interrupting]. I hope you'll help. I don't know 
if you're a fan of country music or not. But country music says 
there's more songs about leaving Nashville and more songs about 
going to Memphis than anything else. So, it'd be an important 
corridor. Airports are important, too. And unfortunately, we do 
not have a direct flight from Memphis to Nashville any longer 
because we're no longer a hub city. We applied for an airport 
grant, and I appreciate your nonpartisanship in giving $5 
million to Chattanooga and getting that money out. But it 
detoured and didn't get to Memphis. Can you give me some kind 
of an idea about what Memphis might be able to do to receive a 
second-round funding? Our airport is older. It needs a seismic 
zone with the New Madrid Fault and the possible earthquakes. 
And we have a very poor population and a low income. Memphis is 
an ideal city to get help. Can you give me some idea about how 
Memphis might receive that?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Yes. There are several funds that have 
become available through the infrastructure law. In addition to 
the ongoing availability, the Airport Improvement Program. And 
so, would certainly welcome applications from those applicants 
who didn't make it in the last round of the Airport Terminal 
Program. We've got several more rounds to go. And it was 
certainly oversubscribed. We'd love to fund as many of those 
projects as we can, as well as depending--that's where most of 
the passenger-facing investments would be, out of the Airport 
Terminal Program. But for other improvements, from tarmac, to 
apron, to runway, to tower, there are a lot of additional 
resources now available, thanks to the infrastructure law that 
could also be areas where they might want to apply.
    Mr. Cohen. Thank you. My time has expired, but I want to 
re-thank you for coming to Memphis when the bridge closed down, 
for visiting FedEx, and for getting part of the underrides bill 
and implementing it in the bipartisan act. Thank you, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you.
    Mr. DeFazio. Thanks, gentlemen. Representative Massie.
    Mr. Massie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Buttigieg, 
I've been driving an electric car for 10 years, and I've had 
solar panels for 15 years. And I'm really bullish on technology 
and the way it could help make our country energy independent, 
or more energy independent. But I'm really alarmed at, sort of, 
the naivete of those who are promoting rapid adoption of these 
technologies with our existing infrastructure. President Biden 
signed a nonbinding Executive order stating that 50 percent of 
vehicles sold in the United States should be electric by 2030. 
Do you support that?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Yes.
    Mr. Massie. And he also said that by 2035, that 100 percent 
of the Federal Government fleet should be electric. Do you 
support that?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Yes.
    Mr. Massie. So, which uses more electricity? We're talking 
about residential electricity here. A refrigerator, when it's 
running, or an electric car, when it's charging in your garage?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, I would expect a car.
    Mr. Massie. Would you say it uses twice as much or 25 times 
as much?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I would think closer to 25 times as 
much, yes.
    Mr. Massie. It's actually 50, at the instantaneous moment. 
But over the course of a year, if I take the numbers from the 
U.S. Department of Energy about the average household, how many 
vehicles they own and how far they drive, over the course of a 
year, an American household would use 25 times as much 
electricity for their electric cars as they would for their 
refrigerator--if they had 100 percent adoption, the average 
family has two vehicles, and this would be if the average 
family had two electric vehicles. Do you think it would strain 
the grid if everybody plugged in 25 refrigerators in every 
household?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, if we didn't make any upgrades 
to the grid, sure. I mean, if we had yesterday's grid with 
tomorrow's cars, it's not going to work. It's one of the 
reasons why we believe that infrastructure includes electrical 
infrastructure and argued for that to be included as it, 
thankfully, was in the bipartisan law.
    Mr. Massie. Do you think by 2030, which is when Biden says 
50 percent of cars sold should be electric, do you think the 
grid will be capable of handling electric cars?
    Secretary Buttigieg. It's going to need to be. And we're 
working with the Department of Energy every day. We've 
established a Joint Office of Energy and Transportation to map 
out some of the needs. Obviously, some of this gets outside of 
my lane. And we've been discussing with, for example, the 
truckstops that are looking at what their power needs would 
need to be at an interchange, where today, they're mainly 
filling up on gas in order to accommodate that. And then, as 
you mentioned, a lot of the scenario for this is also 
residential. But it's also worth pointing out that, while a 
typical driver who adopts electric is using more electricity, 
at the end of the day, they're using less energy because of the 
efficiency benefits of getting that energy produced a utility--
--
    Mr. Massie [interrupting]. Problem is, we don't have the 
capacity to produce that energy. You aptly used the word, 
``need.'' You could say, ``want'' as well. There's needs and 
wants that make this fantasy work by 2030, but the reality is, 
the capability is not going to be there. The average household 
uses 17 percent of their electricity for air conditioning. And 
that would mean the average household uses 1,870 kilowatthours 
per year for air conditioning. If that average household 
plugged in electric cars, do you know how much more electricity 
they would use, in comparison to the air conditioning that air 
conditions their whole house?
    Secretary Buttigieg. No, but again, I would emphasize it 
will be less energy overall----
    Mr. Massie [interrupting]. Let me help you with that, 
first, before we go on, because the numbers are important. It 
would take four times as much electricity to charge the average 
household's cars as the average household uses on air 
conditioning. You think that could be--so, if we reach the goal 
by 2030, that Biden has of 50 percent adoption instead of 100 
percent adoption, that means the average household would use 
twice as much electricity charging one of their cars as they 
would use for all of the air conditioning that they use for the 
entire year. Do you think this could contribute to rolling 
blackouts and brownouts in areas of the country where air 
conditioning is basically considered essential?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Not if we prepare. Look, the fact that 
people who have electric vehicles are going to use more 
electricity can't be a reason to give up the idea that America 
is inferior to the other countries that have figured this out. 
It just doesn't sit well with us in the administration, and 
that's why we're investing in a better grid.
    Mr. Massie. In the time that I have left, let me say, I'm 
not saying we shouldn't prepare. I told you at the beginning of 
this, I'm bullish on this technology. But the numbers and the 
rate of adoption has been developed using political science, 
not engineering. They're impractical, and if we blindly follow 
these goals that Biden has set out, it will cause pain and 
suffering for the middle class. And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. DeFazio. I thank you, gentleman. Representative 
Johnson?
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for 
holding this hearing. And good to see you, Secretary Buttigieg. 
Thank you for your time and your testimony. For decades, 
communities of color and low-income communities have been ill 
served by our transportation system. Our communities face a 
higher burden of pollution and fewer affordable safe 
transportation options. One means to address this is to build 
more high-quality transit lines, such as the Metropolitan 
Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority's--MARTA's--proposal for the 
Southlake Bus Rapid Transit project, which will serve an area 
made up of 93 percent minority individuals. The Southlake BRT 
project is in the pipeline for the Federal Capital Investment 
Grant Program. The Federal Transit Administration is currently 
developing new guidance for the CIG Program, which will 
significantly influence which projects qualify and receive 
funding in the future. Mr. Secretary, how will your Department 
ensure this new guidance, and the CIG Program generally, will 
support equity and deliver real results for underserved 
communities?
    Secretary Buttigieg. We're certainly committed to 
considering equity and other important criteria that belong 
within the framework of our transit policy. And when it comes 
to CIG, which is among the largest competitive Federal grant 
programs, we recognize there's a lot at stake.
    The President's budget requests $2.9 billion in general 
funds for CIG. And additional funds in the amount of $1.6 
billion are provided through the advanced appropriations that 
came in the IIJA. So, that's a total of $4.5 billion to work 
with. This is also a program that requires projects to go 
through an extensive process to ensure that they are going to 
effectively use those taxpayer dollars.
    And the evaluation criteria include things like 
consideration of affordable housing and the transit corridor, 
credit for projects that serve transit-dependent populations, 
and incentives to use alternative fuel vehicles and build 
environmentally friendly facilities. So, you have my commitment 
that, as we continue with the process of updating the CIG 
Program regulation to make sure that the guidance reflects the 
changes that came by way of the infrastructure law, and the 
initial changes are out for notice and comment. We'll continue 
to consider these and other important values and criteria, to 
the extent that the law provides for us to do so.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. And Mr. Secretary, the 
House recently passed an amendment to the National Defense 
Authorization Act that I authored, which relates to the 
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program applicable to 
highway, transit, and safety programs. The amendment eliminates 
the gross receipts cap in effect for DBEs working on surface 
transportation projects.
    This amendment ensures that the definition of a DBE is 
consistent across DOT programs, as it brings surface 
transportation in line with how the FAA defines a DBE and 
ensures that DOT follows SBA definitions for a small business. 
Do you support the elimination of the gross receipts cap for 
surface transportation programs? And also, what additional 
steps is your Department taking to promote maximum 
participation by DBEs in DOT programs?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, first of all, yes, we support 
that step. We recognize that the SBA's governmentwide small 
business size standards are more accurate and consistent in 
terms of measuring a small business. And so, we think this can 
address something that we hear very often as a concern from DBE 
owners who, as one business leader put it to me, feel that they 
are sometimes viewed in such a way that they become too small 
to be big and too big to be small.
    And we are within days of publishing our own notice of 
proposed rulemaking with a number of updates and amendments to 
our program rules to modernize and improve the DBE program. We 
want it to be more user-friendly while maintaining the highest 
standards of program integrity. And look forward to getting 
public comment on that proposed rule, as soon as it's out. I'll 
also say, in addition to the formal requirements and rules 
pursuant to the program, we're also just doing a lot of 
engagement and communication, making sure the DBE community 
knows about the opportunities that are coming and understands 
where to go in order to become more involved. And we'll be 
engaging the incumbent larger firms as well about what we 
consider to be the importance of them being good partners with 
these smaller and disadvantaged companies, too.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, and I yield back.
    Mr. DeFazio. Thanks, gentleman. Representative Perry.
    Mr. Perry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary, thanks for 
being here. I'm sure you know, folks, where I live, my bosses, 
my constituents, are paying about 80 percent more for gasoline 
than they were when President Biden became the President. And I 
think the response--I mean, I think it's fair to say that even 
you have implied that they should buy an electric vehicle and 
absolve themselves of that 80 percent increase per gallon.
    Just looking at Kelley Blue Book, the price of an EV is 
about $55,000. Now, that doesn't include--so, it's actually 
more than that because there's a $7,500 per car subsidy, paid 
for by about $48 billion in taxes on the same people on that 
car. So, it's closer to about $60,000. That's about $20,000 
more than a gas-driven passenger car. About $40,000 more than 
the average compact car.
    At the same time, I'm sure you probably also realized that 
the average Pennsylvanian pays about $170 a month in 
electricity. And that doesn't include the 10 to 15 percent that 
it's just gone up. So, that's an old number. So, it's actually 
more than that. And based on Mr. Massie's numbers, which I 
don't doubt at all, if they could afford the electric vehicle 
and plug it in, we're talking about another $90-$100 a month in 
electric costs. I'm wondering what the administration and you 
are doing other than subsidizing--other than subsidizing--to 
lower the cost. They are even paying more for gas, 80 percent, 
or they are paying more for electricity to the tune of 
essentially doubling their electricity bill. Like how is this 
getting better for my bosses? And what do you plan to do about 
that cost other than subsidies?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, I am very glad you asked that 
question. First of all, I want to be clear. Nobody I know, 
certainly not me, thinks that all or even most Americans can 
easily afford electric vehicles. That said, I'm struck by this 
$55,000 number that keeps going around. I knew this might come 
up, so, I just pulled a few of the latest prices. A Chevy Bolt, 
so, an American-made 2022 EV is $26,595. If you want a pickup 
truck like a Chevy Silverado EV or Ford F-150 Lightning, the 
starting prices of those are $39,900 and $39,974, respectively. 
We've also begun to see----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. Is that pre-subsidy or post-
subsidy?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I think it depends on the automaker 
because some of them have gone through the cap for the $7,500 
and some have not.
    Mr. Perry. Does that include State subsidies as well?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I don't think so. No.
    Mr. Perry. OK.
    Secretary Buttigieg. And look. That is the new car. So, the 
first time I got a plug-in car, for example, Chasten and I got 
one. It was $14,000. It had about 15,000 miles on it. It was a 
C-Max. So, it was a combo, plug-in hybrid. But what we are 
seeing in terms of the dynamics now is we are close to the 
point and may actually be there on certain models and under 
certain circumstances where the extent to which your car 
payment would go up is actually already outweighed by the 
extent to which your gas bill would go down, even factoring in 
the cost of electricity. Now, again, that depends on what 
electricity----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. So, you're saying the market is 
bringing it down. Look. I got my numbers from Kelley Blue Book. 
So----
    Secretary Buttigieg [interrupting]. Are those this year's 
numbers?
    Mr. Perry. What's that?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Would those be this year's numbers?
    Mr. Perry. Actually, last year. But I don't know that 
anything, especially used cars, have actually gone down in 
price. But my other concern is, that I'm sure if you're not 
aware that you should be aware that since 2010, so, essentially 
over 12 years now, we've closed over 550 power generation 
stations, which is about 102 gigawatts. And we are scheduled to 
retire by 2025--so, just a couple years--17 gigawatts of coal-
fired capacity. At the same time, we are asking Americans 
through subsidies and through their purchases to pay for China, 
who has--I think you wouldn't argue--80 to 90 percent market 
share of everything that goes into an electric vehicle--
right?--into an electric vehicle at the same time we are 
essentially reducing power and using Thomas' numbers, which I 
think are correct, we are going to increase the grid 
requirement by at least 50 percent, which none of that really 
works out.
    You look at a country like Ghana who is shutting the lights 
off now because they followed this model that we are following 
right now. What's the administration, and what are you doing to 
make it easier and more affordable to mine critical minerals in 
the United States to support this industry?
    Secretary Buttigieg. One thing we have been working on with 
the Department of Energy is better sourcing of some of the 
elements that go into batteries, for example, ideally in the 
United States and, if not in the United States, then in 
geopolitically friendlier territory. Now, some of this isn't 
just mining. Some of it is actually the refining capacity, 
which is to China's advantage, and we have got to change that. 
I guess our view is we shouldn't accept that as a given.
    Mr. Perry. China refines 90 percent of the manganese. Are 
we going to bring that to the United States?
    Secretary Buttigieg. We would love to bring that----
    Mr. DeFazio [interrupting]. We are over time.
    Secretary Buttigieg [continuing]. Refinement capacity more 
to U.S. and friendly countries.
    Mr. DeFazio. OK. Thank you.
    At this point, I will ask questions, and Rodney Davis will 
ask questions, and then we are going to recess for votes. So, 
Mr. Secretary, I just want to clarify the issue of the guidance 
which caused a bit of a stir when you issued the guidance on 
Building a Better America, we called it ``fix it first'' in the 
legislation that passed out of the House. And let's just get 
straight on the record. Who makes the decision how to invest 
apportioned highway dollars? Is it the Feds or the State DOTs?
    Secretary Buttigieg. It's up to the State DOTs.
    Mr. DeFazio. OK. Does anything in the guidance change that?
    Secretary Buttigieg. No.
    Mr. DeFazio. OK. Have you proposed to eliminate eligibility 
for certain types of highway construction projects?
    Secretary Buttigieg. No.
    Mr. DeFazio. Does DOT propose to take away formula or 
discretionary money from States who add new highway lane 
capacity?
    Secretary Buttigieg. No.
    Mr. DeFazio. Are you forcing any States to build transit or 
active transportation projects over highway projects?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Forcing? No.
    Mr. DeFazio. OK. I do remember your memorable exchange when 
Mrs. Capito, a former member of this committee, asked you 
before the Senate why you were doing this, and you said, 
``Ma'am, because it's good policy,'' which I support. We want 
people just to think these things through. It is not a mandate 
but think about it as you move forward instead of doing the 
same thing again and again, which doesn't work. We induce more 
demand. We build more lane-miles. We induce more demand. We 
build more lane-miles, and we end up with the same congestion 
in the end.
    And then secondly, there has been some controversy about 
your proposed rulemaking on tracking greenhouse gas emissions 
from on-road sources. Now, I remember the day when States were 
allowed to set negative safety targets. Now you have 
performance management rules in areas such as asset management, 
bridge and pavement conditions, and safety. Has requiring 
States to set targets and measure their own progress toward 
these desirable goals helped focus attention in investment?
    Secretary Buttigieg. We think it has. I would describe that 
as good policy, too.
    Mr. DeFazio. OK. Then just on the exchange about EVs and 
that, I don't know what we are going to do with all the 
mechanics. And that is something we have to start thinking 
about. But the life-cycle cost of an EV is significantly less 
than a fossil fuel vehicle. When it was penciled out for the 
post office, unfortunately, the current Postmaster General 
doesn't agree. They would have saved a phenomenal amount of 
money even though there was more upfront cost if they had moved 
to an EV fleet. So, I think that's something that needs to be 
taken into account. So, I thank you. I thank you for your 
testimony, and now I turn to Mr. Davis.
    Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And Mr. 
Secretary, great to see you again. It was great seeing you at 
DCA last week and had a chance to chat with you there. I wish I 
had seen you when Congressman Bost and I were on our never-
ending journey to try and get out of LaGuardia last night. But 
we didn't get a chance to do that. But it is always good to 
talk transportation. And we appreciate you being here today. I 
would mention I was going to ask you about the policy on using 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law resources for Building a Better 
America that Chairman DeFazio asked you about.
    You were pretty clear in your response to him. I hope that 
clarification is given to our States because there is still 
some confusion. We have them reaching out to us, wondering what 
your intention was. So, thank you for that clarification. But 
moving that out to the States would be beneficial too.
    IIJA also includes my provision I helped craft here in the 
House, the One Federal Decision Act. And that would streamline 
Federal environmental reviews, as you know. I have talked to 
Mayor Landrieu about this. Many of my colleagues are worried 
about getting those dollars out the door. You can't do that 
without streamlining the review process. What's going on there? 
The deadlines, including for consulting agencies regarding 
categorical exclusions--can you please update me on 
implementing One Federal Decision?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thanks. Yes. We recognize the 
importance of a swift and prompt process as things are going 
through, especially Federal requirements on permitting. And as 
the earlier exchange highlighted, that is even more important 
in an environment with inflation adding to the consequence of 
things taking any longer than they have to. With regard to the 
consulting that you mentioned, our Department got to work right 
away on that. It effectively allows one department to engage 
another department's categorical exclusions when they qualify.
    So, as called for in the legislation, the DOT completed a 
review of our categorical exclusions. We found four areas where 
we could collaborate with other departments, accelerating the 
process on projects. Especially they are helpful with things 
like post-disaster resilience. And that's, of course, just one 
of the requirements pursuant to the One Federal Decision 
provisions in the law. We are committed to making sure that we 
address all of them.
    Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois. Sure. I would envision, if 
the majority changes here in the House, any legislation that is 
passed into law would likely have more environmental review 
provisions like One Federal Decision. So, implementing it with 
IIJA now could be a barometer in how you do it in the future 
too.
    Mr. Secretary, Amtrak has laid out some ambitious goals. 
Last year, it released its ``Amtrak Connects Us'' plan that 
outlined a 15-year strategy for expansion that would, according 
to it, connect dozens of city pairs. Of the corridors mentioned 
in its 15-year strategy, are you aware that any are ready to 
move forward and be put into action?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, if I am recalling correctly, the 
corridors are laid out in such a way that some of them are an 
expansion of service on existing physically constructed lines. 
Others would require more work. I don't have handy the timeline 
of which could be ready by when. But my understanding is it is 
a mix of things that could be done relatively quickly and 
things that would take more extensive work.
    Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois. So, when you say ``relatively 
quickly,'' has Amtrak or anyone at your agency done any 
environmental reviews for some of these proposed routes?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, depending on the route, we would 
have to see if it would qualify. I think, often, it could 
qualify for a CE because it would be along existing right-of-
way. But I don't know that we have gotten as far as any new 
right-of-way being proposed and ready for an EIS or something 
like that.
    Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois. So, if you don't have new 
right-of-way, you probably haven't reached any agreements with 
landowners on any of the proposals?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I haven't seen it advance to that 
level yet.
    Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois. If you have, will you have 
your team get back to us?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Sure.
    Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois. Also, I know you get lots of 
letters of support for the RAISE grants. Clearly, I know you 
think mine are the best. So, I want to just remind you of a 
couple that I have sent to your agency, city of Decatur in 
Macon County, has the Brush College Road and Faries Parkway 
project. Springfield, high-speed rail project between Chicago 
and St. Louis. Springfield has done a great job in leveraging 
Federal resources to actually combine two tracks into one in 
and around Springfield. They have two more usable segments, one 
RAISE grant and one MPDG grant application.
    Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis with the 
multimodal freight yard expansion in Venice. McLean County, 
Route 66 bike and pedestrian trail, and in Edwardsville, we 
have the Goshen Road and Liberty Trail multimodal 
transportation improvement projects. I will get you a list of 
those so you don't have to write them down. I would appreciate 
your consideration and any updates. Thank you. I yield back.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you.
    Mr. DeFazio. I thank the gentleman. Since we have votes on 
the floor of the House, the committee shall stand in recess, 
and we will return and start again as quickly as possible.
    [Recess.]
    Mr. Stanton [presiding]. I call the meeting back to order, 
and I will take the chair's prerogative and ask a few questions 
to our guest, Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for 
being here. It is great to see you again. My fellow recovering 
mayor, there.
    Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport received a build grant for its 
Northside rail expansion project to allow the airport to meet 
its growing needs. However, as you know, a series of challenges 
stemming from various departmental requirements have hindered 
progress, and as a result, the airport is seeking to scale the 
project to focus solely on the 24th Street overpass. Because 
the obligation date for the grant is rapidly approaching, the 
airport is at high risk of losing these critical Federal funds.
    Mr. Secretary, this project is important to the city of 
Phoenix and to Sky Harbor's future growth. Will your Department 
support our efforts to extend the period of eligibility for the 
grant and work with the airport on this modified project, so it 
does not lose these critical Federal funds?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, our goal, of course, is for every 
grant recipient to succeed when funds are awarded. In this 
case, it was 2019 funding. I believe the issue here had to do 
with meeting the obligation deadline with the proposed change 
in scope that they had, but we would be happy to follow up and 
engage your staff to explore anything we can do to be 
supportive in the context.
    Mr. Stanton. We really appreciate working closely with you 
to make sure we retain those critically important Federal 
funds.
    Arizona is one of the fastest growing States in the Nation, 
and we have real transportation needs. To meet these demands of 
our growing population, we must invest in our interstate 
highways.
    Interstate 10 is a key corridor connecting Phoenix and 
Tucson, yet there is still a large section that is only two 
lanes, creating traffic bottlenecks for the more than 110,000 
vehicles per day that utilize it, and we need new highways to 
move commerce and people like Interstate 11 to link the last 
two metropolitan areas in the country, Phoenix and Las Vegas, 
that are not connected by an interstate.
    Arizona has committed resources to the next phase for the 
environmental work for Interstate 11 and is investing $400 
million in Interstate 10 to expand capacity to address safety 
concerns, improving the movement of goods and people, and to 
increase access to the Gila River Indian Community, but Arizona 
cannot meet these growing needs on its own. It does need a 
strong Federal partner.
    Mr. Secretary, do you agree that the Mega Grant Program 
should focus on projects of this size and scope like the 
expansion of I-10 and construction of I-11 that cannot be done 
by the State alone with its annual formula dollars to ensure 
the Federal Government is a full partner on these projects that 
have impacts on regional and national mobility and commerce?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. Certainly, the intent of 
the Mega Program and our goal in administering it is to make 
sure that projects that are too large or too complex in their 
scope to be supported through traditional means very much too 
large to be shouldered by a State alone get the Federal support 
to help see them through.
    And so, while taking care, of course, not to prematurely 
comment on any application, I would certainly say that we 
intend to be supportive of as many qualifying projects as we 
can. Knowing that the scales that you see with some of these 
efforts are exactly why it was necessary to have an additional 
source of funding as provided in IIJA over and above what we 
have had to work with in the past.
    Mr. Stanton. All right. Mr. Secretary, I want to talk about 
one final issue, and that is passenger rail service. Phoenix is 
the largest city in the United States without access to 
passenger rail service.
    As other communities have gained access to passenger rail, 
they have experienced significant new economic opportunity, but 
my State, unfortunately, has missed out. I am hopeful that will 
change, and there is reason for optimism. Amtrak has proposed 
connecting Arizona's two large and fast-growing metropolitan 
areas, Phoenix and Tucson, with frequent and reliable passenger 
rail service.
    Mr. Secretary, in your opinion, what can we do to best 
support the Tucson-Phoenix West Valley rail line?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, the framework that I think will 
allow us to support efforts like this is the fact that the 
overall funding for passenger rail includes a set of funds that 
is specifically for looking beyond the Northeast Corridor. Of 
course, a lot of the attention is on the Northeast Corridor, 
but a lot of the need is elsewhere.
    So, the FRA has issued a framework for a Corridor 
Identification and Development Program. This came out in May, 
and the first project pipeline should be issued within a year, 
so, next May. And that is one of the places I think would be 
natural to look in the context of the Federal-State partnership 
that got extraordinarily enhanced funding through the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
    I have the pleasure of arriving by train in Flagstaff. I 
certainly understand why there is a need and appetite for that 
kind of service further south.
    Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. My time is 
completed. So, now, the next up will be Congressman Babin.
    Dr. Babin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member 
Graves. I want to thank you for your time today, Mr. Secretary.
    Mr. Secretary, despite the administration's best efforts, 
oil and gas don't seem to be going anywhere but higher. So, if 
you really wanted to help Americans move and move our 
transportation goods, I would think that you might want to 
consider, right now, working with the President to combat high 
gas prices. That is number one.
    And doing something doesn't mean blaming President Putin of 
Russia or begging the Saudi Crown Prince for relief or calling 
the oil and gas companies of America evil and stifling their 
production.
    However, instead of calling on the President, who is your 
boss, to do everything in his power to address skyrocketing gas 
prices, I have heard you prioritize the use of taxpayer dollars 
to push a message of social justice, fighting racist highways 
and equity in transportation.
    And I am struggling to square your priorities with the 
economic reality that we are facing in the United States today. 
You say communities of color are oppressed by racist roads, 
while at the same time, you are ignoring the fact that these 
same people are being disproportionately oppressed by rising 
gas prices. In fact, it is fair to say this administration is 
directly burdening low-income families since they are taking 
the brunt of massive economic challenges that we are facing 
today.
    And Mr. Secretary, you have recommended that Americans who 
cannot afford a $6 gallon of gas should buy an electric 
vehicle, and I am going by the Kelley Blue Book of $55,000; but 
even at your statement a while ago at $39,000, I am not sure 
how you can justify making that ask to folks who can barely 
provide for their families, especially Black and Hispanic 
households bringing in an average of $45,000 and $55,000, 
respectively, per year. How on earth would they be able to buy 
a car that costs almost as much as they make in 1 year?
    And I really think that if you want to do something, I 
think we need somebody who is serving as Secretary that would 
be laser-focused on supporting transportation capabilities and 
not pushing social agendas in this country from your position.
    We have serious issues going on in the United States, 
flight cancellations, worker shortages, sky-high fuel prices, 
unprecedented supply chain challenges; but unfortunately, I see 
more headlines about your positions and stances on abortion and 
on your thoughts on gun rights than I do on plans to improve 
our transportation and our infrastructure.
    I think Americans want lower gas prices and policies that 
will end this inflation and this economic hardship that we have 
today, not a woke social agenda such as a billion-dollar pilot 
program that you launched last month to combat quote, ``to 
combat racially disconnected roads.'' That is $1 billion, and 
that is $1 billion right out of the taxpayers' money.
    And I think Americans know that your administration, that 
the Biden administration, have mismanaged much of our natural 
resources and our economic activities and sound policies which 
has caused this inflation and pushed us to the verge of a 
recession which we are teetering on right now.
    And it, certainly, appears to be a dereliction of duty on 
the part of many in this administration to favor foreign 
nations over our own.
    Frankly, I don't think the price of gas is an accident. I 
believe that it is part of an agenda designed to fundamentally 
change the way our energy and transportation sectors work 
together; and unfortunately, that is an agenda that leaves 
American superiority in the dust, and it is an agenda that 
empowers China and Russia and the Middle East.
    And Mr. Secretary, I do have a few questions that I would 
like to submit for the record, because we are just about out of 
time, and I look forward to your Department's response. I want 
to thank you, again, for being here. I appreciate that, and I 
think that the American people deserve a lot better than what 
we are getting right now with our economy.
    And with that, I will yield back.
    Mr. Stanton. Thank you. I will just give the Secretary 
maybe a minute to respond if you would like to.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Sure. I just want to address a factual 
inaccuracy in your question that I think is important. You 
began by saying that gas prices have only gone up. You will be 
relieved to hear that they have gone down every single day for 
the last several weeks, and I believe that is connected to the 
aggressive actions that the President has taken to reduce gas 
prices for Americans.
    Of course, we want that price to go lower. It needs to. We 
are all feeling the effects at the pump. It is why we don't 
agree with the idea that it is OK to let Putin off the hook for 
his activities or to let oil and gas executives off the hook 
for their stated intention of not increasing production at a 
time of extraordinary profits.
    I have never suggested that it would be easy for all 
Americans to afford electric vehicles; although again, I would 
point to the fact that the first EV I ever had was about 
$14,000, but we think that policy measures can make it more 
affordable, and we hope that Members in this body will 
reconsider their opposition to making EVs cheaper through tax 
credits.
    Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much. Next up will be 
Congressman Carson.
    Mr. Carson. Thank you, Chairman, and thank you, Mr. 
Secretary, for participating today, also representing the great 
Hoosier State quite well.
    I am curious, Mr. Secretary, I am very proud to represent 
Beech Grove, Indiana, which has one of the most important rail 
maintenance facilities in the country; and unfortunately, there 
have been more reports of efforts to effectively downsize or 
outsource maintenance to improve the quality of passenger 
service.
    We need to improve Amtrak's national fleet. No doubt about 
it. I am certain, and I would love for the committee to hear 
your efforts, sir, to continue to support and strengthen the 
great work that is being done at Beech Grove and oppose any 
efforts to outsource this work.
    Are there particular updates or insights you can share, 
sir?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, for anything concerning the 
operational outlook for Amtrak, I would have to refer you to 
Amtrak leadership, but I certainly, recognize the importance of 
the work that workers at this facility do to keep our trains 
operating and operating safely and would welcome any 
opportunity to work with your office on providing further 
information about how some of the funding coming toward Amtrak 
from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act can be applied 
in ways that will create a lot of work opportunity as well as a 
lot of improvements for passengers, both in terms of the 
rolling stock and the maintenance and then, of course, in terms 
of the day-to-day to service.
    Mr. Carson. Yes, sir. Also, we are looking forward to 
working with you on our targeted outreach for the bipartisan 
infrastructure bill, especially, through our Congressional 
Black Caucus Transportation Braintrust later in the fall.
    We want to make sure the historic investments you mentioned 
reach disadvantaged communities and minority businesses, and I 
know our staffs are working together on those details.
    Secondly and lastly, I am very concerned about the 
worsening problems of blocked rail crossings, especially in 
places like downtown Indianapolis where major intersections 
have been blocked for hours. This is a very serious safety 
concern that really impacts urban and rural areas. I believe 
there has to be more that needs to be done statutorily to 
address this issue.
    Mr. Secretary, do you agree those additional authorities 
could help alleviate the frequency of blocked crossings, and 
what more can our committee do to address this issue?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. We would welcome further 
opportunities to work on the issue of railroad crossings, both 
the effects that happen when they are blocked, and the safety 
concerns that they present, and I want to thank you for the 
support for the infrastructure law which provides for the 
Railroad Crossing Elimination Program.
    We are hard at work getting those dollars ready because we 
know that that is going to have a benefit as you have 
mentioned, both for rural and urban communities alike, where 
people have had that experience of being blocked or delayed by 
a crossing; but also, in addition, of course, the economic and 
convenience effect, the simple safety dividend of having fewer 
such crossings. Highway-rail grade crossing incidents and 
trespassing have contributed to 900 deaths in fiscal year 2021 
alone.
    And so, we want to do everything that we can to prevent 
train-vehicle collisions and to use the resources that we have 
to create fewer places where those conflicts can happen in the 
first place, and would, certainly, appreciate continued 
attention from Congress on this.
    Mr. Carson. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. I yield 
back, Chairman.
    Mr. Stanton. Next up will be Congressman Graves from 
Louisiana.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here, good to see you 
again.
    Mr. Secretary, you and I have spoken in the past about 
strong concerns we have related to how the administration is 
prioritizing the allocation of grants, and you have large 
programs like INFRA and RAISE, nearly $1 billion each. I 
mentioned to you that I had actually written much of the 
amendment, had negotiated with other Members the amendment that 
puts in law the right criteria for prioritization.
    So, when the administration came out and said that racial 
equity, climate change, environmental justice, and enhancing 
union opportunities were going to be the driving factors, I had 
strong concerns because those are things that you all are just 
deciding are priorities. They are not things that are actually 
in the law.
    And so, then, I said, ``OK. Well, we will wait and see how 
the grants are actually allocated and decide if this is a 
problem or not.''
    Mr. Secretary, I will remind you, I represent south 
Louisiana. We have one of the most at-risk States for sea rise, 
we have one of the highest African-American populations in the 
Nation, we are at the bottom of the largest watershed taking in 
runoff from Montana, New York, Canada, and everything that is 
in that water.
    And so, I think, if you go through and look at your 
criteria, we should be number 1, 2, and 3--really up there at 
the top--yet, when you allocated funds under the INFRA Program, 
I think it was 15 percent of the money--15 percent--went to the 
State of California. You had about $555 million went to blue 
States. Only $350 million went to red States. Under the RAISE 
Program, $162 million went to bike and pedestrian paths.
    So, I want to ask you a question. If you look at TomTom, 
the navigation company's assessment of the most congested areas 
in America, they said that New York was number 1, and they said 
that Los Angeles was number 2, they said that Miami was number 
3.
    Do you have any idea what number 4 was or is?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I don't.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. So, that would be the metropolis 
of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which puts it ahead of Chicago and 
San Francisco and a number of other significantly larger 
places.
    [Mr. Graves displays a poster.]
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Sixty-two hours a year, time lost 
just sitting in traffic. No one would have expected that that 
be the case.
    So, if you look at the two grant programs, $1 billion each, 
you would think that, with us being the State that should be 
performing at top under your criteria, top under the criteria 
that I wrote because I am incredibly biased, yet, we got one 
grant, and this is what it was: $18.5 million to improve fare 
collection for New Orleans Regional Transit Authority.
    [Mr. Graves displays a poster.]
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. That is kind of hard to 
understand, really hard to reconcile. I tried to get them to 
find a better snapshot on Google Maps traffic, but it is 
normally dark red.
    [Mr. Graves displays a poster.]
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. This is the bridge. It is the only 
place in America where the interstate funnels down to a single 
lane, and it is not because we were innovative and came up with 
a great idea that nobody else could think of.
    It was idiotic and proof is that we have 62 hours we sit 
around and waste in traffic and here is the last slide. It is 
just a picture here showing the bridge that looks like a 
parking lot because people are just sitting there. This is I-10 
connecting California to Florida.
    [Mr. Graves displays a poster.]
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. So, I want to ask, how are you 
prioritizing, and how can projects like this not get funded 
when you are putting money toward bike trails, putting money 
toward--let's see--transit systems got $263 million under one 
of the programs, over one-quarter of the funds, whenever we 
gave transit tens of billions of dollars during the COVID 
relief packages. The highways didn't get anything.
    So, I guess, I am just trying to understand, what are we 
doing, and why aren't we putting money toward true national 
priorities that will relieve congestion, reduce emissions, 
improve time saved in traffic, and other things that I would 
think we would share.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, our shared priorities I think 
are very well served by the things that we funded in the INFRA 
Program and in the RAISE Program, but I will acknowledge that 
for every dollar we were able to give out, there were probably 
about ten that applied.
    So, we had a lot of worthy projects, many I am sure from 
your district or your State and from all around the country 
which qualified, but we were only able to work with the funding 
that we had.
    Of course, thanks to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act, we have more funding than before which means we will be 
able to say ``yes'' more often, and we love nothing more than 
saying ``yes'' to a good project or a good program.
    I think if we start ranking how much is going to highways, 
we would need to include the highway formula funds in that, 
right, which is the bulk of the dollars that go to those 
purposes, and you have, of course, certain things like CMAQ 
that are specifically by the very core of the program directed 
toward congestion mitigation; although, there is no reason why 
that can't be a benefit coming off something like a RAISE grant 
or another piece of legislation.
    I will say, one of the things we tried to do is really make 
sure that these dollars in INFRA, for example, got around the 
country regardless of--certainly, regardless of politics. And 
one thing we were proud of is, I think, there was a 25-percent 
floor for rural projects. We did almost double that. We were in 
the 40s on supporting rural communities.
    I know that for every project we are able to say ``yes'' 
to, there are several more that would be--folks would be 
disappointed we couldn't get there.
    Secretary Buttigieg. But again, thanks to this----
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. Mr. Secretary, I am 
out of time, and I appreciate you being here and answering 
questions. I look forward to following up with you on this, and 
I would like to ask, Mr. Chairman, if it is OK, if you could, 
please, provide the committee with the metrics for how you have 
measured those four criteria that I mentioned. I would 
appreciate it.
    Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much. Next up is Congresswoman 
Titus.
    Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. 
Secretary.
    I want you to know that in Nevada, we share your enthusiasm 
for the funding that is going into infrastructure. I would just 
point out a couple of things that we are doing. We got $2.5 
billion for our roads and highways, $225 million to fix our 
falling-down bridges, $100 million for our High-Speed Nevada 
initiative for connecting with the Internet, and $5.5 million 
for EV charging stations.
    That put a lot of people to work, or it will, and it will 
help us to grow and develop, and we invite you to come out and 
see any of those projects in the works.
    We had the highest unemployment in the country at 35 
percent, but we are recovering that at a rapid rate thanks to 
investments like this. So, I hope we will see you in Nevada.
    My question, though, I would like to go back to my 
colleague from Phoenix to talk about intercity passenger rail. 
I want to just be sure I understand how that partnership grant 
program is going to work.
    So much of the investment in rail goes to the Northeast 
Corridor, but we need to invest in the Southwest as well. They 
need improvement. We need a greater availability.
    So, I want to be sure that this would enable a public 
entity like Nevada to apply for the grant and partnership with 
a private intercity passenger rail company.
    Second, what is the timing for when that application will 
occur? And third, will you help us and work with me to see that 
regional impact as opposed to just local impact plays a role in 
the determination of who gets those grants?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you.
    To take the last question first, we, certainly, want to 
think about the regional effect and how any given vision for 
expanding passenger rail fits into an overall vision for a 
first-rate passenger rail network serving the entire country, 
and I know there is a great deal of interest in this in the 
region you represent.
    I want to emphasize that, under the annual funding of the 
partnership, the State-Federal partnership, which gets $36 
billion in advance appropriation over the next 5 years, that 
not more than $24 billion can be provided to projects that are 
in the Northeast Corridor. So, we understand and share the goal 
of Congress to make sure that no one region monopolizes the 
funding.
    Right now, FRA is working through the applications for the 
fiscal year 2021 partnership funding but will later this year 
be able to make the funding available for the fiscal year 2022. 
They issued just a few weeks ago in late June, the notice of 
approach to developing the NEC inventory.
    But again, the non-NEC program will be made clear. The 
parameters of that will be made clear later on this year, and I 
would certainly welcome the opportunity to work with you and 
work with project sponsors from your region on how to provide 
service where it could have a very big impact.
    Ms. Titus. Yes. If you look at I-15 from Los Angeles to Las 
Vegas, on the weekend, it is like a parking lot going one 
direction or the other. We believe a speed train along that 
same corridor would carry people in both directions. It 
wouldn't just be a gambler's train. People would go south on 
the train to Los Angeles, could become a commuter train. It 
gets cars off the road and improves the air quality.
    We have been studying this for a long time, and we are 
close to making some progress, so, we hope to work with you and 
see that that happens.
    And I thank you very much. You can come out there for the 
groundbreaking. How about that?
    Secretary Buttigieg. We would love it. Thank you.
    Ms. Titus. I yield back.
    Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much. Next up will be Mr. 
LaMalfa.
    Mr. LaMalfa. Hello, Mr. Secretary.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Good afternoon.
    Mr. LaMalfa. Welcome to our little event here. Thank you. I 
will launch right in here.
    So, I am a Member from California, northern California; and 
in my home State, we have had this project that was initiated 
in 2008 by a vote of the people for $9 billion worth of bond 
funds to go to the high-speed rail to complete a project from 
San Francisco to L.A., right?
    So, over the years, we have found that they fall farther 
and farther behind, and the price goes up and up and up. It was 
sold to the voters then in 2008 as a $33 billion project with 
the possibility of adding also a Sacramento and a San Diego 
spur for a little more money later.
    Well, it has fallen way behind. It was supposed to be 
completed in--2020 actually was the original sale that the 
voters were given--and now, they hope to have one segment done 
by 2023, and the price has skyrocketed from the $33 billion 
that the voters saw on the ballot to a number somewhere around 
$105 billion, and it was supposed to also draw in a lot of 
private investment to make up for the difference between the $9 
billion and the $33 billion at the time.
    So, they have been able to lay their hands on or identify a 
number somewhere around $20-$25 billion maybe via cap and trade 
and other things for a $105 billion project.
    So, we are $80 billion short of being able to build it out, 
and the Federal Government has put forward recently, I think, 
about $2 billion in the recent IIJA and about $3\1/2\ billion 
in the 2009 stimulus act.
    And so, here we find ourselves $80 billion short to build 
out at whatever today's price is, a project that currently, if 
they can complete it in a certain amount of years--who knows--
it wouldn't go from S.F. to L.A., but Madera to Shafter, 
California, which Madera and Shafter are kind of like S.F. and 
L.A., right?
    But anyway, I am pretty tired of this project not meeting 
any promises and going way over and such, but I want you to be 
aware, Mr. Secretary, that a simple thing like the land 
acquisitions that are happening in the route--and so, they 
haven't identified the whole route yet. They know the easier 
part through the Valley and South Bay linking up with the North 
Valley.
    They don't know how they are going to get it through the 
Tehachapis to L.A., but they are not even paying people for the 
land that they have taken from them through eminent domain.
    Are you aware of that situation, sir?
    Secretary Buttigieg. You are saying that people have not 
been compensated for expropriation of their land?
    Mr. LaMalfa. Right. Right.
    Secretary Buttigieg. I would want to see more details about 
the case here.
    Mr. LaMalfa. I would be happy to supply that to you.
    So, I mean, can you support a federally backed project if 
it was more a Federal nexus of taking property without 
providing the compensation? You wouldn't do that; would you?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, any federally funded project 
would have to comply with all of the law with regard to, 
obviously, everything from Title VI to making sure people are 
appropriately accommodated.
    So, again, I would want to know more. Is this the subject 
of a Federal complaint to your knowledge?
    [Pause.]
    Secretary Buttigieg. Anyway, we will look into it.
    Mr. LaMalfa. Yes. We will get back with you, yes, sir. 
Thank you.
    But as the prices go up, when does the value become not 
there for the thing? I mean, I can see Acela here on the east 
coast, high ridership, density of population, and that works 
out, more or less.
    But here, we are decades behind now by the time we build it 
out, and the price has at least tripled. Now, if I just had a 
bid for getting my roof done, and they told me $33,000, and 
they show up to start changing shingles, and they said, ``Oh, 
now it is $105,000,'' I would say, ``I need a different bid.''
    So, at the endpoint, what is right for the taxpayers on 
this?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, the way we view it is that, that 
decision is not entirely up to the Federal Government. It is 
largely up to the project sponsor and the people of California, 
who, as you have noted, there is Federal money into this, 
especially from the 2009-2010 funds, but also the State has in 
its recent budget agreement, I think, committed another 4.2.
    So, what we really want to do is make sure that we are 
getting the greatest bang for our Federal buck while partnering 
with the State and proceeding as they see fit.
    Mr. LaMalfa. They will be looking to the Feds for a lot 
more because we are about tapped out at the State level. Let me 
shift gears. I am sorry. Time always goes fast.
    The AB5 implementation, that bill in California which is 
basically taking small truckers and putting them out of 
business if they are not operating as an employee of a larger 
company, have you provided any guidance to the truckers in the 
State about how we are going to comply with AB5 and not have 
just a complete loss of those pool of truckers and already the 
supply chain issues we have?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, certainly, a priority for us is 
to increase employment in trucking, and we have seen that that 
has grown substantially.
    So, in this case, we have been able to engage with the 
different players, but I need to emphasize also that, when it 
comes to the litigation that is going on over this, the 
Department is not a party to that.
    Mr. LaMalfa. Yes. I mean, we are talking owner-operators, 
not necessarily employees. The owner-operators, do they have a 
place at the table anymore?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Say again?
    Mr. LaMalfa. Do the owner-operators have a place at the 
table anymore; do you see?
    Secretary Buttigieg. We, certainly, think owner-operators 
are a very important part of the future of trucking just as 
they are at the present.
    Mr. LaMalfa. OK. Thank you. We have the PRO Act [inaudible] 
in DC [inaudible] AB5.
    But anyway, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Congressman. Next up will 
be Congressman Huffman.
    Mr. Huffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Secretary, it 
is great to see you. Welcome back to the committee. Let me just 
tell you how much I have been enjoying your testimony and your 
answers to questions.
    Like you, my starter EV was a C-Max, not much of a head 
turner but very practical. I appreciate your sensibilities, and 
I also appreciate the calm and factual way you have debunked a 
few of the things that have been thrown at you by our 
colleagues whether it is the price tag of EVs or conspiracy 
theories about Government taking without compensation. We 
appreciate your leadership.
    One of the great things coming from a coastal California 
district that I believe is in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
is the historic investments that allow communities to build 
greater resilience and adaptation; and of course, my district 
is on the frontline of climate impacts.
    So, this includes the $8.7 billion from the newly created 
PROTECT Grant Program as well as new eligibility in the 
National Highway Performance Program to mitigate against sea 
level rise, projects that mitigate sea level rise.
    So, in my district, that is really important because it 
allows State and local transportation officials to plan and 
design and build differently. Instead of highway widening 
projects from the 1970s, it asks them and invites them to 
anticipate impacts we know are coming in the next 20 to 30 
years.
    But it does require a change in approach, some 
institutional changes to shift away from doing things the way 
they have always been done. And I just wanted to ask you about 
that. Is the Department of Transportation helping to guide or 
plan with local and State transportation officials to make sure 
that they are looking decades down the road and not building 
projects from the 1970s?
    And I do realize that the chair asked you about whether you 
are forcing States and locals to build certain ways, and I 
appreciate your answer that you are not. But are you offering 
guidance and help for them to plan in the way we need them to 
plan?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you for the question.
    And it is especially timely given what we are seeing in 
terms of climate impact on American infrastructure, and we know 
when we are building something new that we might be making--or 
the project sponsor might be making--a 30-, 40-, 50-plus-year 
decision which means that we have got to be prepared to build 
for the world as it will be, not the world as it has been.
    So, for that reason, we are stepping up our efforts to 
collaborate with different project sponsors on being able to 
take those kinds of considerations that you raise into account.
    And I also want to stress our appreciation for the robust 
funding in the PROTECT Program specifically dedicated to 
enhancing resilience. That is $7.3 billion over 5 years, and 
$1.4 billion of that in this fiscal year. That is out of the 
formula program, plus a discretionary program, too, that we 
look forward to rolling out soon, all of which we think will 
help to put our money where our mouth is as a country on the 
idea of building resilient infrastructure and preparing for all 
of the impacts ahead.
    Mr. Huffman. I appreciate you mentioning the PROTECT 
Program, and you said, ``rolling out soon.'' Is there anything 
more you can tell us about the anticipated timeline for that?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Let's see. I brought my little table 
of upcoming Notices of Funding Opportunity because I knew this 
would be of interest. I don't have a hard date, but I know that 
it is one of the priority programs we are looking forward to 
announcing shortly; and as soon as we do have a date, we will 
make sure to make that known.
    Mr. Huffman. We look forward to hearing about that.
    In the time I have left, Mr. Secretary, I want to ask you 
about EV charging infrastructure, another important element of 
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and there have been some 
recent reports of Tesla opening up its supercharger network to 
non-Tesla EVs.
    They are already doing this. I guess, they have been 
required to do this in the European Union, but I am seeing some 
accounts of that change now coming here.
    Can you talk about whatever update you may have on that and 
how significant that would be to our aspiration of having 
ubiquitous high-quality EV charging infrastructures, so we can 
accelerate this transition?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, it would make a big difference. 
We are working hard to reach the President's goal of half a 
million charging stations built out in a nationwide network by 
the end of this decade, and it has never been the vision that 
all of those are, or most of those, are Government owned and 
operated.
    Tesla has built an extraordinary wide-ranging and highly 
effective network of chargers that are available, of course, 
for use for the owners of those cars. I have heard Tesla 
leadership, including in meetings with me and other OEMs, 
discuss their vision for using some kind of adapter equipment 
to make them available to drivers of other vehicles.
    I haven't seen any concrete timelines or steps in that 
direction, but it is, certainly, something we would welcome.
    Mr. Huffman. All right. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Stanton. Next up is Mr. Gimenez.
    Mr. Gimenez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and good to see you, 
Mr. Secretary.
    Mr. Secretary, on September 6, 2019, in a campaign stop, 
the President in New Hampshire, he said, ``I want you to look 
into my eyes. I guarantee you, we are going to end fossil 
fuel.'' Do you support that?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, I certainly support a transition 
to domestic clean energy in our lifetime.
    Mr. Gimenez. In your lifetime. Well, what is the timeframe 
for that?
    Secretary Buttigieg. For my lifetime? Only God knows the 
answer to that question, sir.
    Mr. Gimenez. OK. All right. What steps are you taking to 
bring this along? What steps are you--do you want to see the 
demise of fossil fuels here in the United States?
    Secretary Buttigieg. We want to see the rise of domestic 
clean energy production. It is creating a lot of jobs alongside 
fossil fuel industries which, of course, are still a very 
important part of our economy.
    We recognize that we are running out of time when it comes 
to the consequences in terms of the destruction of American 
property and lives from the burning of fossil fuels in 
transportation applications and the energy. We are pursuing a 
policy that is going create more domestic clean energy 
production because we think that will lead to a better economy, 
and it will save those lives and that property.
    Mr. Gimenez. Even though there are estimates that the world 
is going to need additional fossil fuels for the next 50, 60, 
70 years. Do you think that that should be American fossil 
fuel, or they should be Saudi fossil fuel, or Venezuelan fossil 
fuel?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Our preference, again, is American-
made domestic clean energy production, and that is what our 
policy----
    Mr. Gimenez [interrupting]. Excuse me. You keep saying, 
``clean energy.'' I am talking about fossil fuel. I am talking 
about natural gas. I am talking about gasoline, et cetera. Are 
you in favor of additional production here in the United 
States, or do you want to see that limited?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, as you know, we have proposed, 
for example, that oil companies that have decided not to 
produce right now be faced with a choice. They can either 
produce on the permits that they have, or they lose access to 
those, and that is an example of, I think, the administration's 
recognition that, at least in the short term, we are working 
with what we have even as we are seeing a transition through.
    Mr. Gimenez. Of a different tack, I looked at the F-150 you 
said, both the electric and the gas-powered one, and there is a 
difference of about $20,000 between one and the other; and when 
you look at the $20,000, if you estimate about 20 miles to a 
gallon, it is going to take about--at today's prices, it takes 
about 80,000 miles in order for you to break even, and I am not 
even talking about charging costs. I am just talking--no 
charging costs.
    And so, if you actually put that down to about $2.50 a 
gallon, which was the price of gas before the Biden 
administration, you don't break even until about 160,000 miles.
    Is the Biden administration actively pursuing high energy 
prices in order to force Americans into electric vehicles?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Of course not. And I also want to 
emphasize that you don't have to wait that 80,000 or 160,000 
miles or however many it would be to break even if you don't 
pay for the vehicle in cash, right? The great thing about an 
auto loan is, you can realize the--or lease--is you can realize 
the savings in terms of less maintenance and less fuel even 
while the initial car payment might be higher, right?
    And so, you are coming out ahead right out of the gate, 
instead of having to wait many years for a payback, unless of 
course, you are buying the vehicle in cash.
    Mr. Gimenez. Well, I mean, your finance costs are going to 
be--depends if you lease it, et cetera--but the finance, at the 
end of the day, you are going to be paying $20,000 more however 
you cut it, at least; and actually, if you finance it, you are 
going to pay more because of you will paying interest. All 
right?
    So, at the end of the day, again, you are going to take 
either 80,000 at $5 a gallon, and it is 80,000 miles to break 
even; and then, by the way, have you figured in the 10-year 
lifespan of a battery that you have to change so if you have a 
160,000----
    Secretary Buttigieg [interrupting]. Yes, we have. I mean, 
the estimates that are showing that this is reaching parity and 
pointing toward a savings depending on the model do account for 
things like that.
    Mr. Gimenez. But you would agree that the higher the price 
of gas, then the faster you reach that parity?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Of course. The more pain we are all 
experiencing from the high price of gas, the more benefit there 
is for those who can access electric vehicles. It is why we are 
hoping you and your colleagues might reconsider opposing the 
reduction of EV upfront prices with tax credits.
    Mr. Gimenez. So, you are saying the more pain we have, the 
more benefit we are going to get?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Of course----
    Mr. Gimenez [interrupting]. I think, that is what I heard 
you say. You are saying the more pain that we----
    Secretary Buttigieg [interrupting]. No. That is what you 
heard me say.
    Mr. Gimenez. Yes. That is what I heard you say.
    Secretary Buttigieg. I know you want me to say it so bad, 
but honestly, sir, what we are saying is that we could have no 
pain at all by making EVs cheaper for everybody, and we would 
love to have your support on that.
    Mr. Gimenez. Are EVs cheaper by subsidizing them or----
    Secretary Buttigieg [interrupting]. Yes. That is part of 
it.
    Mr. Gimenez. Yes. But that doesn't make it cheaper. That--
--
    Secretary Buttigieg [interrupting]. Well, actually it does. 
It makes it cheaper because that market-making investment gets 
you past the tipping point. Current estimates actually are that 
the U.S., as we cross that 5 percent new sales level, is 
starting to hit what analysts typically consider to be that 
tipping point.
    But the more we stimulate the production of the clean cars, 
right, the more you hit the economies of scale that makes them 
cheaper to produce in the first place which means that you 
won't need as many subsidies in the future. That is why we 
believe in this policy.
    Mr. Gimenez. Well, that is subject to debate. Thank you 
very much. My time is up. I yield back.
    Mr. Stanton. Thank you. Congressman Payne.
    Mr. Payne. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And Secretary, thank you for being here today. It is always 
good to see you.
    A couple of notes. The funding you mentioned going to Long 
Beach in reference to the rail expansion along the ships to 
remove the need for trucks, we might want to look at that for 
Port Newark as well, and so, just, I am always throwing things 
at you by the way.
    And also, in February, I led 34 other Members in asking DOT 
to get nearly $7 billion out the door quickly to advance 
investments in the Northeast Corridor, the dreaded Northeast 
Corridor, ooh.
    Under the Department's current timeline for establishing 
the Northeast Corridor inventory, States and others are not 
likely to see this money until 2023. FRA's delay is 
unacceptable.
    What is your Department doing to expedite the availability 
of these funds to answer our demand for better passenger rail?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, we recognize the importance of 
working swiftly to prepare these investments while also making 
sure that these investments that you only get to do once are 
well considered. The Northeast Corridor Commission is working 
through the next steps, and we have been consulting with them.
    On June 25, the FRA published a notice of approach to 
develop the NEC project inventory and opened up a comment 
period to get input from the stakeholders on the Commission, 
and we want to continue that consultation with the Commission, 
but that process is one, again, that happens not without a 
sense of urgency, and so, we remain on track to publish the 
inventory by the statutory deadline which is November 15th of 
this year.
    Mr. Payne. Thank you. Now, on my taking over the 
chairmanship of the Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous 
Materials Subcommittee, I found that there was no DBE program 
in the Federal Railroad Administration has studying if 
discrimination exists in the passenger rail industry--I can 
answer that--which would suggest the need for a Disadvantaged 
Business Enterprise program.
    It is critical that the study is completed both thoroughly 
and promptly, so that, if a need is shown for the FRA DBE 
program, Congress can respond quickly to guarantee that the 
IIJA rail funding creates a fair playing field for 
disadvantaged businesses.
    When do you expect the disparity study to be completed, and 
do I have a commitment that this remains, as you told us last 
year, as a top priority for you?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Yes. It is very important to us to 
deliver on this priority, and we have undertaken a number of 
actions to move hope forward with this program and provide 
Congress with a package of material for consideration.
    I can tell you that the team is working hard to complete 
the study. It is a topic every time I sit down with our FRA 
Administrator, and as soon as it is fit for delivery, we will 
have it in your hands.
    Mr. Payne. Thank you. Well, I think that is all I have, and 
I yield back. Thank you.
    Mr. Stanton. Thank you. Next, I believe, Mr. Mast.
    Mr. Mast. Yes. Thank you.
    Mr. Payne, you could have yielded me your time. I would 
have----
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Mast. Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here today.
    I want to ask a very specific question, and this is about 
hours of service for truckers. Do you feel as though you are 
endangering the lives of any American on the roadway with the 
hours-of-service waivers that are being given for truckers that 
are hauling something related to COVID, or Clorox, or 
automobile parts?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, we think the waivers are 
justified, or we wouldn't enact them. I do think that, over 
time, we are going to learn from the data that come back on 
what effect, looking back on these years, the waivers will 
determine to have. But of course, if we didn't believe that 
they were a responsible way to strike the balance, we wouldn't 
pursue them.
    Mr. Mast. I agree with you, Secretary. If we didn't believe 
that they were responsible, they wouldn't be in place.
    So, there's an hours-of-service waiver for allowing 
truckers who carry food, fuel, products to fight COVID, 
livestock, car parts--a host of things on that list--and they 
can basically set their own flexible driving schedule that they 
otherwise wouldn't be allowed to as long as they take a 10-hour 
break each day.
    So, it is far more simple than what they otherwise fall 
under without that waiver. So, I would say it in this way. I 
think, you and I could agree that a trucker is not a safer 
driver because they are carrying Frosted Flakes that might be 
on the waiver list versus laundry detergent. That would be an 
agreeable statement?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I think so. Obviously, we recognize 
there are certain differences in cargo, but not all of those 
differences are the same as the ones that qualify you for the 
waiver. If that is what----
    Mr. Mast [interrupting]. Well, then that example, Frosted 
Flakes, would be waivered, so that you can just have a 10-hour 
break, laundry detergent wouldn't be waivered.
    Secretary Buttigieg. OK.
    Mr. Mast. So, that wouldn't make a difference in the 
quality of the trucker, or how they perform their duties or 
safety?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I hope not.
    Mr. Mast. I would hope not as well. Likewise, we couldn't 
say that they would be better because they are carrying Clorox 
wipes versus baby clothes, right, and the list could go on and 
on.
    So, the request here is, for our truckers, the 
administration, it is clearly determined that this kind of 
flexibility for truckers, it is not a major safety threat to 
say, ``Truckers, hey, if you are carrying COVID-related items 
or Clorox wipes, all you need to do is make sure that you have 
a 10-hour break.'' We don't need all of these other things that 
go on in that hours of service, lack of flexibility.
    So, it is not a threat. We agree on that. We have 
determined it. The goods being carried don't determine to 
threat--largely obviously, there can be hazardous materials--
but even when we talk about hazardous materials, we could say 
that fuel is on that waiver list, probably one of the most 
hazardous materials that could potentially be involved in a 
collision, but that is on the waiver list.
    So, we look at this, and we say, the Trump administration, 
they had that policy for about 9 months. The Biden 
administration has now had that waiver policy for about 1\1/2\ 
years. So, the request is, let's make it permanent and extend 
those protocols to truckers that are carrying anything. Right?
    They shouldn't have to go through the redtape of 
determining whether they are carrying Frosted Flakes or laundry 
detergent or Clorox wipes or baby clothes or whatever. If it is 
not a safety threat, as we have determined it is not, to give 
them those 10 hours.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Yes.
    Mr. Mast. You get 10 hours of rest. It is not a safety 
threat. Let's let them not have to waiver this.
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, I think, the response to that 
hangs on the difference between believing something is a 
responsible balance and believing it has no safety impact at 
all. I think, we are agreed that it was a responsible way to 
strike the balance, especially in responding to a crisis that 
has claimed the lives of 1 million Americans.
    I would want to see more data suggesting that there was no 
safety impact at all before I could endorse the conclusion that 
you are speaking to. But I do think it is reasonable to say 
that, any time, even if it arises out of an emergency, we 
gather data from some kind of flexibility being introduced, we 
should learn from that and include that in our decisionmaking 
for the future.
    I just wouldn't say that we have reached the point where we 
think that in any way justifies releasing those safety 
requirements wholesale.
    Mr. Mast. Yes. And I can appreciate you wanting to look at 
the finer data points of this. It would be wrong for us not to 
do that, but again, just to close that, we can see that we are 
assessing. There is not a big enough safety threat to get rid 
of it. It has gone on for 9 months under Trump and 1\1/2\ 
years-plus--2 years--under Biden.
    So, it is not a big enough safety threat to not do that. We 
should be looking at that for everybody given that people carry 
a host of different things.
    Just one final quick point here, and this comes from people 
that have to deal with the FAA badge office. I have an 
understanding that there are a number of very disrespectful 
people in the FAA badge office that people in DC here are not 
happy having to deal with in that office. If you could address 
that in the way that they treat people that come through that 
badge office, it would be greatly appreciated by some people 
that I know.
    Secretary Buttigieg. I will look into that right away. 
Thank you for raising that.
    Mr. Mast. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
    Mr. Malinowski [presiding]. The Chair recognizes Mr. 
Lowenthal for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Secretary, I represent the Port of Long Beach. I am the 
cochair with Randy Weber from Texas of the Congressional PORTS 
Caucus. Thank you for being here and thank you for visiting our 
ports and really becoming so knowledgeable about our ports, and 
I appreciate your efforts to ease port congestion and to reduce 
the costs for all American consumers.
    The IIJA Port Infrastructure Development Program or the 
PIDP is among the most critical tools to make freight move more 
efficiently, to strengthen our supply chains, and tackling the 
shipping costs.
    In addition to the legislation, measures like expanding 
gate hours at ports, popup container storage sites, ensuring 
more transparency and data for freight exchanges have been so, 
so important, and they are important signs of progress. For 
example, freight rates from China to the west coast have fallen 
almost 50 percent in the last 2 months.
    I want to stress how critical it is that we ensure that the 
PIDP is allocated as quickly as possible, and that these funds 
support the electrification projects needed to increase 
efficiency and to reduce the environmental impacts which our 
higher freight flows have had on our climate and on our 
frontline community. We also need to prioritize the funding 
available under section 11402 of the IIJA to reduce truck 
idling at ports.
    Mr. Secretary, can you share more about what the 
administration is doing to prioritize these critical projects, 
to coordinate multimodal freight flows, and to reduce cost, and 
when can we expect funding to be awarded?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you very much for the question 
and for the attention to the importance of efficiently and 
smoothly moving freight through our ports.
    As you mentioned, we have seen a lot of gains in terms of 
sharp reductions in the number of ships at anchor and in terms 
of improvements in shipping rates; although, they are still, of 
course, higher than their pre-COVID levels, and we know there 
is more work to be done here.
    Specifically, with regard to the Port Infrastructure 
Development Program, we are working to advance the 2022 funding 
as quickly as we can. We released the Notice of Funding 
Opportunity for that program within 90 days of the 
infrastructure law passing consistent with the President's call 
to move quickly as part of the ports action plan, and we have 
also issued the amendment incorporating the funding from the 
Appropriations Act within 60 days of that legislation moving 
through.
    So, now, we have got the applications in. We are working 
diligently to review them and anticipate being able to announce 
awards early in the fall, and I really look forward to the 
difference that that can make in terms of our capacity and 
readiness in our ports.
    In the meantime, of course, we are not waiting for longer 
term infrastructure upgrades in order to continue trying to 
drive progress in this regard, and I would point to measures 
like the creation of FLOW, Freight Logistics Optimization 
Works. This is a data-sharing platform.
    It is not mandatory. We are not ordering anybody to share 
anything. It is voluntary, but those different players, 
including private-sector actors in different parts of the 
supply chain, who contribute data then get access to the 
benefits of participating in that system.
    We think it is going to make a big difference, and we are 
looking forward to having a prototype of that up later on this 
year, and our ports envoy, General Stephen Lyons, continues to 
work with all of the different players at the ports to spot and 
identify any and all issues that can be addressed in the near 
term whether it is through Federal action within our 
authorities or just getting the right players at the table.
    Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, and I yield back.
    Mr. Malinowski. Thank you. The Chair recognizes 
Representative Johnson for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Mr. Secretary, first off, I 
would thank you for the positive comments you have made about 
the Ocean Shipping Reform Act that Mr. Garamendi and I helped 
to usher through the House and so, thank you for your support 
of that. We have talked a lot about ports so far today, and I 
think that will help. It is not a silver bullet, but I think it 
will help.
    When you appeared before this committee last year, you and 
I had a productive conversation about siting and about how the 
same type of project that would take 2 years to get sited, a 
highway project, in France or in Germany; on average, it would 
take 7\1/2\ years in America, which is clearly not evidence of 
American exceptionalism; and in fact, makes it harder to have 
American exceptionalism present itself.
    You had talked, then, about some of the things that we can 
do, I think you said, to move aspiration into action. Are we 
making any progress on that front, and do you see room for 
additional leadership by this Congress in helping make it 
easier for us to do large projects?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, first of all, let me acknowledge 
and thank you for your work on the bipartisan Ocean Shipping 
Reform Act. It is another thing I should have mentioned just 
now in my earlier answer of something that we think will make 
progress on when it comes to shipping and supply chains.
    And to your question, yes, I think we have made progress, 
and yes, I agree. There is much more work to be done.
    The comparisons to Europe are especially important, I 
think, because we are talking about countries that are 
certainly rigorous in their labor standards and in their 
environmental standards, and yet consistently seem to be able 
to deliver projects at a lower cost and at a swifter timeline 
than tends to happen in the U.S.
    Some of the things we have done in this regard include 
increasing our visibility on what is going on with permitting, 
so, the permitting dashboard is our main tool for doing that 
and enacting the One Federal Decision-related provisions that 
were in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that is 
included and matching up the categorical exclusions that our 
Department can join to with other agencies when there is some 
interagency question, and making sure that we have a game plan 
for how to hit those averages called for, the 2-year average 
for the kinds of environmental review that many of our projects 
are subject to.
    But we recognize this is going to be a big ship to turn and 
welcome all opportunities for good-faith collaboration on how 
to do it without, of course, diminishing community voices or 
environmental or other important--labor or other important 
policy considerations, but having a pace and a cost of getting 
through these processes that I think is what most Americans 
would expect.
    Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Yes, and one of the things I 
struggle with is--and this is true whether we are talking high-
voltage transmission lines or highways. People talk about how 
long it takes to get something sited and then I will tell them, 
OK, bring me the specific knob we can turn, right? And I am 
sure you ask the same question.
    Because there are so many factors that slow down these 
processes, it can be hard to figure out what button do you push 
or what lever do you pull. So, it is a bit of an unfair 
question for me to ask you, but as you review all of these 
myriad things that make it difficult to get big projects done 
in this country, is there one piece that we should focus our 
collective fire on? One or two specific things we could be 
working together?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I think, as you noted, there is not a 
silver bullet here, but I do think there are a few directions 
that will be productive to look in. One is the capacity of the 
project sponsors, so, making sure that they have the tools they 
need to navigate these processes, especially because if we are 
successful in bringing investments to jurisdictions that 
haven't had much before--maybe small rural jurisdictions and/or 
low-income areas that just haven't done much with the Federal 
process--we can't expect them on day one to know how to 
navigate it. And so, I think the support and the technical 
assistance there is going to be important.
    Second, of course, is to make the processes simpler in the 
first place. It is one of the reasons you see us combining some 
of our Notices of Funding Opportunity and even combining the 
selection process just to have less paper and fewer steps 
involved by virtue of having fewer programs on parallel tracks.
    I think visibility matters. That is why we think that the 
dashboard--I know it is a readout, not a mandate, but I 
actually think it could play an important role because it will 
just help us spot some of these issues.
    We are trying to make sure we are combining the final EIS 
in the record of decision to make sure that there is not a big 
gap between those. We have also pursued the integration of some 
of the permitting processes with the NEPA side of it because we 
think some of those things can travel together, too.
    So, I am afraid I don't have a sense of one or two things 
that would make all the difference, but anything and everything 
that we can do consistent with our bedrock commitments we are 
certainly open to exploring.
    Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Mr. Secretary, thanks. And 
then, Mr. Chairman, via way of closing, I would just note that 
this is a serious problem. I mean, nobody would suggest that 
European countries flout environmental or labor standards. They 
are able to get it done in 2 years. Frankly, America should be 
able to get these projects done in that kind of timeframe as 
well, and I thank the Secretary for his efforts.
    Mr. Malinowski. Thank you so much. The Chair recognizes Mr. 
Lynch for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Lynch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome, Mr. 
Secretary. Good to see you. Steve Lynch, I represent the Port 
of Boston. And thank you for your recent visit. It sounds like 
you have been getting around to all of our ports. That is a 
good thing.
    First of all, I want to thank you for the support of the 
Biden administration and your office. Recently we received $62 
million to try to rebuild the terminals in Logan Airport. Those 
are 1974-era terminals, so, we really appreciate the 
opportunity to update those.
    I want to also thank your office for working with us on the 
North Jetty. We have obviously one of the oldest ports in the 
country, and some of our infrastructure dates back to pre-World 
War I. So, we are trying to repair that, and your office has 
been very, very helpful.
    In addition, we have had some problems with the MBTA 
recently, and the Federal Transit Administration has been very, 
very helpful in terms of coming in with guidelines that allow 
us to operate that system not at full capacity, but safely. And 
we appreciate their thoughtful and deliberate approach to that.
    One of the other positions I hold is I am a vice chair of 
the Quiet Skies Caucus. And so, we are having difficulty in and 
around Logan Airport. Logan Airport was actually originally 
built in the 1920s by the United States Army, and they laid out 
the runways to favor the wind direction for those planes back 
in the 1920s that didn't have much thrust.
    So, unfortunately, as the city has grown, those runways now 
steer planes directly over many environmental justice 
communities. And not only that, but with the advent of next-gen 
air-nav systems, we have thousands and thousands and thousands 
of planes flying over laser-guided air vectors over the same 
homes, repeatedly, and it is causing health problems for the 
people in those areas next to the airport.
    Now, I have tried to persuade the FAA to look at an 
approach here where they would adjust the configuration of the 
runways. We have an entire port area where they could be 
bringing in flights and having flights take off completely over 
water, not flying over these densely settled, as I said, 
environmental justice neighborhoods. But I have had great 
difficulty in persuading them to do so.
    I am wondering if your administration, your office would be 
willing to work with us on that. We obviously have a great need 
in the area, but this is critical to the quality of life to the 
people in my district.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, I want to recognize your 
leadership of the Quiet Skies Caucus, and certainly we 
recognize that as the FAA moves to modernize the National 
Airspace System, there is a risk that these efforts can result 
in changes to the flight pattern that effectively concentrate 
the route and concentrate the noise and this, of course, 
concentrates the impact on the residents who live directly 
under them.
    I would be humbled by attempting to venture anything 
specific to runway configuration here. I know that is very 
technical and often has to do with things like the direction of 
the wind and other engineering considerations, but certainly 
would welcome further dialogue with your office on how to make 
sure that those community impacts are managed as responsively 
as possible and that any mitigations that can be identified 
responsibly are pursued.
    I know that the FAA has sought to add resources in terms of 
community engagement, and anytime that is found wanting, 
welcome the chance to work with the congressional office to try 
to firm that dialogue up.
    Mr. Lynch. That is great. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I just 
want to point out that periodically we do have to redo the 
runways. We just had one of the major runways redone several--
well, over a year ago now, and we shut it down and we moved the 
flights to another runway. So, logistically we could do this if 
we had--I have had dealings with the FAA, and in some things 
they are great and on other things they are impervious to 
public input and impervious to congressional persuasion as 
well.
    So, I would appreciate your cooperation on that, and I am 
thankful for the work that you have done in the Port of Boston 
and I appreciate what the Biden administration has done as 
well.
    Mr. Chairman, I will yield back.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you.
    Mr. Malinowski. Thank you. The Chair recognizes Mr. 
Balderson for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Balderson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Secretary, 
thank you for being here. I was actually on the same flight to 
Columbus on Friday night with you, so, it was good to see you 
going to the airport and getting on the plane. So, thank you.
    I was a strong supporter of the DRIVE Safe Act and I was 
proud to offer this bill as an amendment when the committee 
marked up Chairman DeFazio's infrastructure bill last year. 
This program creates a pathway for CDL holders between the ages 
of 18 to 20 to participate in interstate commerce after 
completing substantial safety training. And while I had major 
concerns with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, I was 
happy to see this important pilot program included in the final 
bill.
    Can you discuss the current status of the Safe Driver 
Apprenticeship Pilot Program?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, I want to recognize your work on 
this and recognize also that it happens in the broader context 
of needing to make sure that we have the strongest and best 
possible workforce in truck driving. It has been estimated that 
the gap is as high as 80,000, although I think it has closed to 
some extent. And so, the question that this pilot program 
speaks to, of course, is: Is there a way to engage younger 
drivers without any kind of detriment to safety? And I think 
the pilot program has provided us with a responsible way to 
determine that.
    In January of this year, FMCSA announced the establishment 
of the program in the Federal Register. So, that was the first 
step really to get the details out about the pilot. And they 
are now completing some of the other administrative tasks they 
will need just because it is a new program, but I do believe we 
will be able to begin to accept applications into this program 
by the end of summer of this year and then we will be watching 
closely, of course, to see how it unfolds and to ultimately 
gather the data that will tell us what, if any, safety impact 
there is.
    Mr. Balderson. OK. Thank you very much. I appreciate that 
answer.
    Mr. Secretary, last month I sent you a bipartisan letter 
signed by 67 of my colleagues regarding several issues facing 
motor vehicle carriers and those transporting hazardous 
materials. Behind this issue is the costly background check 
redundancies within the Transportation Worker Identification 
Credential, Hazardous Materials Endorsement, and the TSA 
PreCheck programs.
    I have heard from drivers across industries that 
streamlining or harmonizing these credentials, which largely 
require the same information, would go a long way in reducing 
costs and unnecessary burdens on drivers. I understand this 
issue is under TSA's jurisdiction, but since you are the 
cochair of the Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force and you are 
the primary regulator of the trucking industry as Secretary of 
Transportation, I am curious if you have any thoughts on this 
matter or if you have heard anything from TSA or DHS on efforts 
to reduce these redundancies.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, I don't want to preempt the 
process of replying to your letter just because we do want to 
make sure we coordinate with DHS on that given TSA's role. But 
let me affirm the general principle that whenever the 
Government is gathering information from the same person twice, 
we have an opportunity. And provided we can find ways to meet 
this concern that don't have any adverse effect on safety and 
security, we are very open to examining what we can do.
    Mr. Balderson. OK. Thank you very much. And anytime you are 
in Columbus, Ohio, again, let me know. I will get a nice dinner 
arrangement for you. So, thank you, sir, and Mr. Chairman, I 
yield back.
    Mr. Malinowski. Thank you so much. The Chair recognizes 
Representative Carbajal for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Secretary Buttigieg, 
welcome. I commend you and the Biden administration for your 
leadership in helping us to advance the historic Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law.
    This represents some of the largest investments to bring 
our Nation's roads, bridges, transit, broadband, and waterways 
into the 21st century, and, at the same time, create good-
paying jobs for many Americans.
    My district has already begun to benefit from these Federal 
infrastructure dollars in so many ways. Currently, the Santa 
Barbara County Association of Governments is working towards 
improving U.S. Highway 101, which is one of two critical and 
major north-south arteries in California. This May, they 
applied for Federal Mega/INFRA dollars to reduce congestion 
along a portion of U.S. 101, encourage a shift of mode of 
transportation, strengthen job accessibility, and reduce 
harmful pollution from greenhouse gas emissions.
    I worked on this project when I served in local government 
on the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors, and I can 
tell you this project is a win-win-win, not only for our local 
region but for the entire State transportation system.
    There is $810 million--almost $1 billion--in State and 
local funds--yes, I said local funds--currently pledged to this 
project, which means approximately 80 percent of this project 
is coming from non-Federal sources. So, I think it is fair to 
say that it is time for the Federal Government to step up.
    Can you provide an update on the timeframe for when your 
Department will be making determinations on these applications?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, thank you for the question, and 
certainly we recognize that and the former mayor in me 
recognizes that State and local jurisdictions have been asked 
to shoulder too much for too long. It is part of why the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is so welcome. And part 
of what we have sought to do with the particular program you 
are referencing, the combined INFRA/Mega/Rural NOFO is to 
position ourselves to deploy these dollars as quickly as we 
can.
    When the deadline closed for this combined Notice of 
Funding Opportunity, we had more than 450 applications. So, we 
are working through those right now and should be able to 
announce selections in the fall, and looking forward to funding 
as many deserving applications as we can, and this will 
certainly get full and fair consideration.
    Mr. Carbajal. Great, thank you. Again, 80 percent funded 
with non-Federal dollars.
    As a member of the Climate Solutions Caucus, I supported 
the inclusion of the Carbon Reduction Program in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law. How are you working towards reducing 
harmful emissions?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, the Carbon Reduction Program is 
going to give us $6.4 billion of resources to help communities 
and States and jurisdictions in this work. And we are looking 
forward to seeing the plans as they begin coming through on how 
States aim to use that.
    I should emphasize the bulk of this is formula dollars that 
the States can program as they see fit, provided it is 
consistent with the basic outlines of what Congress calls for 
in the legislation.
    Of course, that is not all there is to the opportunity to 
mitigate carbon through this infrastructure law. Just about 
anything you do in transit almost by definition will lead to 
reduced carbon pollution. That is doubly true for things like 
the low- and no-emission bus program and other things that help 
transit, which is already presumptively carbon-reducing to also 
operate on a cleaner basis. And I think across all of the 
programming you see, even or especially when we are meeting 
other goals like enhancing our supply chains or giving 
commuters or passengers a more convenient and efficient 
experience, that we are going to be making a major difference 
on carbon as well.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. Let me just close by reiterating 
my standing invitation to you to visit my district. As you can 
see, that 101 major project is a very significant effort going 
on in my region, but there are many others, and I hope you will 
consider coming out. I know my constituents would love to 
showcase all that we have done and continue to do in regards to 
transportation and infrastructure. So, please come out. Some of 
us call my area paradise on earth, which you would be remiss to 
not come out to. Thank you.
    Secretary Buttigieg. I would love it. Thank you.
    Mr. Malinowski. He does have a very nice district. I can as 
chair attest to that.
    We will now recognize Mr. Katko for 5 minutes. Thanks.
    Mr. Katko. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I just want to 
correct the record and say that Syracuse, New York, is paradise 
on earth, not Mr. Carbajal's district.
    But Mr. Buttigieg, I want to thank you very much for being 
here today, and it is good to see you again. The last time I 
saw you, I think we were in the White House a year ago, in the 
Oval Office, in February, speaking about infrastructure with a 
small group of individuals with the President and Vice 
President there as well. And a lot has happened since then, and 
I am thrilled to say that I was the very first Republican to 
cast my vote in favor of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act.
    It is a culmination of many years of work on my part and 
others, and it started back in 2017 with the Problem Solvers 
Caucus. I chaired the subcommittee that issued an 
infrastructure report. We updated it in 2021. We presented it 
to a group of Governors, Senators, Members of Congress, and it 
caught fire and went from there.
    So, I am thrilled that we finally got it across the finish 
line, and I am glad to be able to talk to you about it here 
today.
    And central New York, as you know, is going to be a major 
beneficiary of this act because of the Interstate 81 rebuild 
that is going to be going through the heart of the city. And 
that money is sorely needed there and elsewhere across this 
country.
    Providing stable and dependable Federal funding for 
infrastructure was one of the reasons I came to Congress. And I 
was proud to do my part to make that a reality by supporting 
this infrastructure bill.
    In addition to providing billions of dollars for a wide 
range of other physical infrastructure priorities, New York 
State is seeing a significant increase in its apportionment of 
Federal highway aid under this law, which is welcome news. From 
major highway projects to addressing wear and tear on rural 
roads, this funding makes a huge difference top to bottom 
across our State.
    And unfortunately, along with many of my constituents, I am 
concerned about how far this money is going to go in the near 
future due to the dramatic rise in inflation. I want to note 
that the infrastructure bill is not the problem here, and it is 
not the inflation driver. There is not an expert who says it 
is.
    In fact, according to experts from the American Enterprise 
Institute, the infrastructure bill actually eases inflationary 
pressures in the long run because of its focus on improving 
productivity over the next decade.
    However, as we all know, this was not the only bill 
Congress passed last year, and we now find ourselves at a point 
where inflation reached a 40-year high of 9.1 percent last 
month, which is the most I have seen since I was a young man 
when the Carter administration was in power.
    Inflation has impacted prices in every sector, but of 
specific interest to our conversation today are the prices of 
construction materials and fuel, which are going through the 
roof. As States and localities try to budget for in-demand road 
and bridge projects, sustained inflation is going to make it 
even more difficult to stretch these critical infrastructure 
dollars to cover the projects that Congress intends them to.
    As a result, we end up facing the exact same dependability 
challenges this bill was supposed to address. So, I have a 
couple of quick questions for you, and if you could help me 
with them, I appreciate it.
    First of all, what steps are the Department taking to 
ensure that the purchasing power of the infrastructure act 
remains intact? And second of all--and you can take these in 
either order you would like--can I assume that the Department 
of Transportation is [inaudible] efforts on permitting reforms 
to the infrastructure act to help reduce the baked-in costs and 
delays for these projects?
    And with that, I yield back.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, thank you, and let me recognize 
your support and leadership when it came to this infrastructure 
law coming together and strongly agree with you and with the 
economists who have indicated that seeing it through is going 
to ease inflationary pressure.
    For that reason, we feel a great sense of urgency about 
making sure that we effectively use these taxpayer dollars. And 
there is no question that the increased cost of input to 
building infrastructure represents a challenge for us in 
implementation. This is true whether we are talking about 
supply chain constraints contributing to raw material costs or 
whether we are talking about workforce shortages impacting 
labor costs.
    So, several things that we are able to do, and one thing I 
would point to is the collaboration that we have with project 
sponsors to share best practices from what we have seen around 
the country and even around the world on how to effectively 
keep those costs under control, use technical assistance to 
provide that kind of support, and of course continue working 
the root causes of the issue through efforts like the Supply 
Chain Disruptions Task Force.
    We also see certain flexibilities that do exist within the 
legislative framework, and when they are there we will pursue 
them in order to make sure project sponsors succeed, but are of 
course always open to working with Congress on other measures 
that we can take to make sure that we really get that value, 
that $1.2 trillion worth of economic and other benefit to the 
American people for the taxpayer investment that is being made 
here.
    Mr. Katko. Thank you very much. I yield back.
    Mr. Malinowski. Thank you so much. I will recognize myself 
now.
    Let me start, Mr. Secretary, setting a couple of things 
straight. I am sure you will agree with me that every American 
should have the freedom to buy whatever kind of car they want.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Agreed.
    Mr. Malinowski. But when more people buy EVs, the overall 
demand for gas goes down, right? Which means that the price of 
gas also goes down for everybody who still exercises their 
choice to buy a gas-guzzling car. So, this is a win-win. I 
don't understand why this has become a partisan or Tribal issue 
in America.
    And then when it comes to gas prices and Putin, I remember 
the days immediately after Russia's invasion of Ukraine; 
virtually all of my Republican colleagues were taking to the 
airwaves demanding that President Biden ban Russian oil, every 
single speech on the House floor and committee hearings 
confronting administration officials coming to brief us, and 
all of us knew perfectly well that this would result in gas 
prices going up. You cannot take the number 2 world exporter of 
oil offline in a day without having that effect.
    And I, in those days, I drafted a House resolution that 
would have urged President Biden to do exactly that, to ban 
Russian oil, but in the text acknowledging that there would be 
economic sacrifices for the American people, hoping that we 
could come together as Democrats and Republicans patriotically 
urging the President to do the right thing, but taking common 
responsibility. And I couldn't find a single Republican to sign 
on to that resolution because apparently some people wanted the 
President to do it and then to blame him for the consequences. 
And unfortunately, we are still seeing that today.
    With that, I want to ask you what I always ask you about, 
which is the Gateway Program for New Jersey and New York. We 
have made such extraordinary progress working with you and your 
team. We ended the Trump-era policy that made it harder for 
States to finance their portion of big infrastructure projects.
    We finally got the environmental impacts statement done for 
the tunnel. We secured and improved project rating from the 
Federal Transit Administration. We signed a full funding grant 
agreement to replace the Portal North Bridge and we will be 
breaking ground on that essential project in the coming days. 
And just 2 weeks ago, New Jersey and New York agreed on how 
they are going to split the costs of this incredibly important 
project at the State level. And then, of course, we passed the 
infrastructure bill that will fund this.
    But just as I pushed really hard to get us to this point, I 
am going to push just as hard to get this done faster. And I 
understand these projects are complicated. They don't get built 
overnight. But I am sure you won't be surprised to hear my 
constituents are not going to be happy to hear statements like, 
this could go until 2035. It is not going to be acceptable.
    So, I actually want to echo Mr. Johnson's question to you 
about why infrastructure project delivery in the United States 
takes so long and costs so much in comparison with other 
wealthy countries that have equally strong labor and 
environmental standards as the United States. What are we going 
to do about it and how can we apply those measures to this 
project, the Gateway project for New Jersey and New York? Thank 
you.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, thank you. First of all, let me 
share your enthusiasm for making sure that the Gateway project 
is a success. It holds the potential to ease congestion, to 
provide better service, to create stronger redundancy and 
availability for intercity rail and a whole number of other 
issues that will be very important for the Northeast Corridor 
and represents such an economically significant set of 
transportation activities that the entire country will benefit.
    And in particular, I want to applaud the agreement that was 
reached between New York and New Jersey, knowing that it is 
never a small or easy thing for two States to agree on cost-
sharing. And I called Governor Murphy and Governor Hochul to 
express my appreciation for their leadership on that.
    It is a project or a set of projects that will I think test 
us in terms of our ability to reduce the gap between the cost 
it takes to deliver a project in the U.S. and the cost you see 
in a lot of other Western countries.
    While I can't point to any single factor that explains the 
difference, there are a number of things that we know 
contribute to it. Part of it is the complexity of aligning the 
different parties, and so that is why we are so pleased to see 
the States collaborating in this regard. Also, the Gateway 
Development Commission now has its executive director named. 
That is also we think a very positive development because it 
gives you the unified leadership that you need.
    We also want to inventory best practices from other 
countries or other parts of the U.S. that have been quicker 
than others while maintaining project quality. And we are 
driving ourselves very hard internally to try to make sure the 
process is as smooth and as straightforward as possible.
    We think that with the right level of intentionality, we 
can buck the trend of very large, very complex projects to go 
longer and cost more than they should.
    Mr. Malinowski. Thank you so much. I yield back my time and 
we will now go to Mr. Westerman for 5 minutes. Thank you.
    Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Secretary 
Buttigieg, for being here today. Count me among one of those 
Members of Congress who didn't vote for what I would call the 
world's largest infrastructure spending package in the history 
of the world, one that was more than enough money to completely 
rebuild the U.S. Interstate Highway System in today's dollars. 
But the big issue was that not only did it not come before this 
committee, it went before no committee and had no markup in the 
House of Representatives.
    But it is the law now and as we look to do oversight on it, 
I noticed that last Friday, FHWA proposed a notice of proposed 
rulemaking to require State DOTs and metropolitan planning 
organizations to establish declining carbon dioxide targets and 
develop a system for measuring and reporting greenhouse gas 
emissions. This is in line with the President's Executive order 
in January of 2021.
    However, nobody voted on this in the IIJA because it wasn't 
in there. So, in light of the Supreme Court's recent ruling on 
the EPA's authority over powerplant emissions, do you have any 
concerns that the administration may be overstepping the law in 
putting this out? And plus the amount of time--this is a big 
issue, and I have already had my State DOT contact me about not 
having enough time to comment on it.
    Secretary Buttigieg. We are very confident in the 
congressional authority for this rule. It actually dates back 
to 2012, when Congress passed MAP-21, which provides for the 
Federal Highway Administration to put out performance measures. 
We have used that authority, or I should say the Department 
because much of it is before my time, but the Department has 
successfully used that authority on a number of different 
issues, and this is part of that tradition, and I think one 
that comes at a very important time.
    Obviously, the evidence on climate change and the 
destruction of American lives and property due to climate 
change is beyond any doubt. We also know that the largest 
sector in the U.S. economy contributing greenhouse emissions is 
the transportation sector. And we have been very mindful of the 
limits on Federal authority in crafting this proposed 
rulemaking. It doesn't, for example, mandate any targets. It is 
really about the States being able to track their progress 
toward their own targets.
    But with this being such a central issue of importance for 
the world and for the American people, what would it say about 
us if we couldn't even measure it? And so, we are trying to get 
those basic standards in place, and if your State DOT has any 
concerns in terms of their ability to comply, this is certainly 
the time to make those known through the NPRM comment process, 
but also we would be happy to engage with them directly.
    Mr. Westerman. Thank you. And you talked about climate and 
carbon. It is something that I work on. I have worked on a lot 
of natural climate solutions. But you had mentioned earlier in 
the testimony, and I know you have a goal--or you bought into 
the goal of I think replacing half of the fleet by 2030 or half 
of the new car sales, and you just mentioned that 
transportation is the largest sector of carbon emissions.
    So, what percent of the world's carbon emissions is the 
United States accountable for?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I think at this point we are--we 
remain in the top two, if I recall correctly, and are in the 
neighborhood of 15 percent.
    Mr. Westerman. Fifteen percent. And transportation being 
the largest part of that, what percentage of that 15 percent is 
transportation?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Depending how you count, something 
like one-third.
    Mr. Westerman. OK, one-third of 15 percent. I think the 
number is actually closer to 27 percent, but that is all of 
transportation. How much of the transportation are passenger 
cars responsible for?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I would say surface is the biggest 
share. I don't have the percentage offhand. I just know that it 
is something we are responsible for, and with every piece that 
we are responsible for, shame on us if we don't do the best 
that we can.
    Mr. Westerman. Yes, and if you go through the math, you 
find out that if every electron going into an electric vehicle, 
if all passenger cars were electric vehicles, you are 
offsetting less than 1 percent of global greenhouse gas 
emissions, which, that is nothing to laugh at, but it is just 
not the panacea that I see folks on the left claiming that it 
is, and it is a huge cost to our country. Do you think there 
are other areas that maybe we should--with all the challenges 
with electric vehicles?
    And I heard you talk earlier about how we are developing 
the minerals and elements, the copper wire, the lithium. Well, 
you are saying that, and then I am the ranking member on the 
Natural Resources Committee, and I see bill after bill to 
withdraw mining from Federal lands where these resources lie. 
So, if we are developing them here in this country, I sure 
don't know where we are developing them. It appears to me that 
we are relying more heavily on China and other countries to 
provide the minerals and elements that we need, and we are not 
developing here. So, it looks like there is a miscommunication 
between the administration and what Members of Congress are 
working towards, and kind of in opposite directions.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Malinowski. If you would like to respond, it is OK.
    Secretary Buttigieg. I don't want to tie up any more time. 
Just to endorse the idea that there is going to be a lot of 
different things we have got to do at the same time. We simply 
think anything that we are responsible for, especially using 
technologies that exist and that American workers are making 
good money building right now, are those that show the most 
promise and those that we have got to push the hardest on.
    Mr. Malinowski. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes Mr. 
Allred for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Allred. Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman. I want to thank Chairman DeFazio for holding this 
hearing.
    Secretary Buttigieg, it is great to see you. Thanks for 
coming to Dallas and seeing some of the good things that we 
have going on there. I want to thank the Department for getting 
the historic funding from this bill that I was proud to vote 
for out as quickly as you have. These dollars are making 
already a monumental impact on my community and communities 
across Texas.
    In fact, last month the Texas Department of Transportation 
released its plan to build out an EV charging infrastructure 
throughout the State to support 1 million electric vehicles. 
Thanks to the IIJA, the State is expected to receive about $407 
million over 5 years to do that.
    Now, as you know--you have been to Texas, it is a big 
State; we have got some big distances involved. I am wondering 
how you propose working with State DOTs that are similar to 
Texas if they build a reliable network of stations that 
addresses range anxiety that maybe some consumers have and 
allow us to really make this a success.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, thank you. We recognize that for 
your community and communities across Texas and many in the 
U.S., the ability to successfully participate in the EV 
revolution, to get the fuel savings that come with owning an 
EV, are only as good as your opportunities to charge them, and 
especially if your work or your commute requires you to cover 
long distances on a regular basis.
    We have got to make sure that it is as certain that you 
will find chargers where you need them as it is that you will 
find gas stations where you need them on a road trip today.
    With the funding that Congress has provided, we have 
formula dollars going to every State. This year, a slice of 
that--$615 million--to make sure that there is that backbone 
across the highway network.
    And I will say this was crafted with a lot of regard for 
the differences between the States. We don't know what the 
right way is to lay it out in every particular, so, we have 
asked the States to prepare their plans and then file them with 
us by August 1st. As long as they meet the legal requirements, 
then we will be off and running on funding them and look 
forward to seeing what Texas and the other States prepare for 
us.
    Mr. Allred. Yes, I think it is exciting. In a former life I 
was an NFL player, and I was interested to see in the last 
Super Bowl, every car commercial was for an electric vehicle. 
Right? And this is what I think people are excited about. But 
for States like Texas, for us to move into that future, we need 
this charging infrastructure. And so, I think it is an 
incredibly important aspect of this bill.
    I also want to talk about aviation. As you know, DFW is 
home to one of our busiest aviation sectors. We are home to the 
second busiest airport in the world, Dallas Fort Worth 
International Airport. In 2016, it received recognition as the 
first airport to become carbon neutral in North America. 
Recently, DFW received $35 million from FAA to increase 
terminal sustainability and assist the airport in reaching its 
net-zero emissions goal by 2030.
    And I am wondering how the Department envisions airports 
using the Airport Improvement Program funds from IIJA to help 
build capacity at the airports, and if you believe these funds 
will help with some of the delays that I certainly have been 
hearing about and also experiencing as somebody who flies twice 
a week on most weeks, and cancellations that I think so many 
folks here in the country are feeling.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. Yes, we were very pleased 
to support DFW's application through the Airport Terminal 
Program that is going to help them with a powerplant, and I 
think yield not only air-quality improvements and 
sustainability improvements but also I think cost savings for 
the airport in the long run, which means whatever those fees do 
go to maybe are more likely to be passenger-facing than if they 
were just going----
    Mr. Allred [interposing]. Right.
    Secretary Buttigieg [continuing]. Into the heating and 
cooling bill, which we certainly welcome.
    You mentioned the other program, the Airport Improvement 
Program, AIP, which is funded to the tune of $3.35 billion in 
the President's fiscal year 2023 budget request. And those are 
dollars that we think will help enhance capacity as well as 
safety, security, and other concerns at the airports.
    And so, that will be part of the stack alongside the other 
sets of aviation funding that came in the infrastructure law 
that can really help us on everything from physical plant 
improvements around the airport--the runway, the apron, the 
gates--to things like air traffic control facilities that if 
you allow them to deteriorate can also become a limiting 
factor, not to mention a quality-of-life issue for our very 
hard-working air traffic controllers.
    All of those call for investment, and we are glad that we 
are able to deliver so much of it now thanks to the bipartisan 
law.
    Mr. Allred. Absolutely. Well, I know I am almost out of 
time here. I just want to say I was happy to hear you say 
recently you plan to use the funds from IIJA to establish high-
speed rail demonstration projects in the country, and if you 
could briefly elaborate on how the Department plans to deliver 
on that goal and how much of the funding do you plan to 
allocate towards high-speed rail projects just very briefly.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Sure. So, in a nutshell, it is enough 
not to build out a full high-speed rail network across the U.S. 
but to begin to demonstrate that the U.S. can do high-speed 
rail as effectively as anyone. And we look forward to 
supporting as many routes as possible. It will probably be a 
handful stacked alongside all the other rail needs in the U.S., 
but enough, I hope, to show that America can lead here as well.
    Mr. Allred. Well, we certainly want it in Texas. And with 
that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Malinowski. Thank you. We will go to Mr. Nehls for 5 
minutes. Thanks.
    Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. 
Secretary, for being here.
    Part of the genius of the Founding Fathers was the system 
of checks and balances. Congress has a duty to oversee the 
executive branch, and Members of Congress deserve answers to 
questions they pose to the executive branch.
    My office has written several letters to you, and we have 
not received a response on most of them. I sent you a letter 
back on May 2nd asking you a very simple question about whether 
the Biden administration supports maintaining a preferential 
no-fly zone for Disney. Did you ever receive that letter or did 
you read it?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I believe we have it, yes.
    Mr. Nehls. OK. Mind you that no other amusement park enjoys 
restrictions on airspace, including competitors like Universal 
Studios. These no-fly zones are usually reserved for high-
security targets like the White House and our most sensitive 
military facilities like nuclear launch sites. So, that totally 
makes sense.
    I would like to add no executive agency wrote to Congress 
about a national security need for this no-fly zone, which is 
the custom. The Obama administration's FAA Administrator 
testified that Disney's no-fly zone does not meet the standard 
requirements and would not be in place had Congress not enacted 
specific legislation, a process that has been widely reported 
that was done out of uncouth lobbying.
    So, what is the administration's stance on the preferential 
treatment for Disney's no-fly zone?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, of course, fundamentally we 
simply have to apply the law, and in this case, as you noted, 
this set of flight restrictions that the FAA maintains, we do 
so because it is part of congressional legislation that was 
enacted in 2004 and then we codified those in notices to air 
missions.
    I know that we have had inquiries both from Members of 
Congress from time to time and from industry about this, and 
ultimately any changes to that policy would be for Congress to 
put forward just as the policy itself has come from 
congressional statute.
    Mr. Nehls. Fair enough, and thank you. And I will be 
pursuing just that here in the next Congress.
    And could you please--and just in one word, let's have some 
fun with this--could you please describe America to me in one 
single word. What would that be if you could describe America 
in one single word?
    Secretary Buttigieg. For me, I guess home.
    Mr. Nehls. Home. Fair enough. Fair enough. Well, just a few 
weeks ago, this is how President Biden described America in one 
word [indicating a poster]. Could you please tell me what that 
word means? It is this one right here. Could you even say the 
word?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Congressman, I am not in the habit of 
trying to read transcriptions of----
    Mr. Nehls [interrupting]. I bring this up to you, sir----
    Secretary Buttigieg [continuing]. Words on television.
    Mr. Nehls. I bring this up to you because you yourself 
questioned Donald Trump's mental state of mind in September of 
2019 when you stated to CNN, I quote, ``If our Presidency is 
not in good shape, then our country is not in good shape.'' And 
Mr. Secretary, I could not agree with you more. I am going to 
repeat what your quote is. ``If our Presidency is not in good 
shape, then our country is not in good shape.''
    Inflation is at 9.1 percent, gas prices are through the 
roof, our adversaries are exploiting our weaknesses across the 
globe, and our southern border is nonexistent. This 
administration puts the American people last. The left and the 
dishonest media, which in my humble opinion is the greatest 
threat to this country, the dishonest media, began questioning 
President Trump's mental state back in February of 2017, a 
month into his Presidency.
    We now have President Biden in office for 18 months, and 
just recently we now see the mainstream media questioning 
President Biden's mental state, and for good reason. Sadly, he 
shakes hands with ghosts and imaginary people. He falls off 
bicycles. Even at the White House Easter celebration, the 
Easter Bunny had to guide him back into his safe place [poster 
is displayed]. Cue cards that say ``sit here'' or ``end of 
speech,'' which he actually states--that is, if he stays awake 
[poster is displayed].
    So, my question for you is, sir, have you spoken with any 
other Cabinet members about implementing the 25th Amendment on 
President Biden?
    Secretary Buttigieg. First of all, I am glad to have a 
President who can ride a bicycle.
    Mr. Nehls. Answer the question.
    Secretary Buttigieg. And I will look beyond the insulting 
nature of that question and make clear to you that the 
President of the United States----
    Mr. Nehls [interrupting]. Have you spoken to any----
    Secretary Buttigieg [interrupting]. Of course not.
    Mr. Nehls [continuing]. Other Cabinet members about 
implementing the 25th Amendment on President Biden?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Of course not.
    Mr. Malinowski [interposing]. Please allow the witness to 
give his answers.
    Secretary Buttigieg. You ought to know that the President 
of the United States----
    Mr. Nehls [interrupting]. Have you emailed--this is my 
time. Have you emailed any members with the executive branch--
--
    Secretary Buttigieg [continuing]. The President of the 
United States----
    Mr. Nehls [interrupting]. About the President's health or 
cognitive decline, including text messages, from your private 
phone?
    Secretary Buttigieg. The President of the United States is 
as vigorous a colleague or boss as I have ever had the pleasure 
of working with.
    Mr. Nehls. I figured this. What about political appointees 
that you are speaking to? Have you spoken about this to----
    Mr. Malinowski [interrupting]. The gentleman's time has 
expired.
    Secretary Buttigieg. I couldn't hear the question, I am 
sorry.
    Mr. Malinowski. Well, that----
    Mr. Nehls [interrupting]. Will you yield me 1 minute, sir?
    Mr. Malinowski. Absolutely not. If you had yielded the 
Secretary some time to actually answer the ridiculous question, 
you might have actually gotten something.
    We will now----
    Mr. Nehls. [interrupting]. The question?
    Mr. Malinowski [continuing]. Turn to Mr. Garcia for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Nehls. Mr. Van Drew?
    Dr. Van Drew. I will yield you a minute.
    Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Nehls. Mr. Van Drew would like to yield me.
    Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and ranking 
member, for convening this hearing, and of course thanks to 
Secretary Buttigieg for joining us today.
    The IIJA was an important bill that funds our policy needs. 
As the chairman reminded us last week as his portrait was being 
unveiled, the House passed a truly game-changing, 
transformative bill that we call the INVEST Act, establishing 
greenhouse gas emissions metrics, advancing a ``fix it first'' 
agenda, a massive investment in environmental justice 
initiatives to name a few. Even though we weren't able to 
advance the INVEST Act, or the Build Back Better Act, I am 
heartened that under your leadership, Mr. Secretary, the U.S. 
DOT has begun to implement parts of this progressive agenda 
under its existing authorities.
    Still, more must be done, and how we implement the IIJA is 
absolutely critical. For far too long, transportation policy 
has been disconnected from the broader social justice debate, 
yet it determines access to jobs, clean air, clean water, 
affordable housing, and the fate of our climate. Mr. Secretary, 
I represent a working class immigrant community in Chicago in 
the Cook County suburbs, and as you know, Chicago is a hub for 
rail, air, and truck transportation.
    Our communities deal with both the good and the bad of 
that. My neighborhood, Little Village, has some of the highest 
asthma and respiratory diseases in the country, and 
unfortunately, pollution from our transit corridors plays a big 
role in that. We have to be honest about the policies that led 
us here and deliberate about setting a new path. Mr. Secretary, 
approximately how much of IIJA money is going to expand 
highways and add lanes?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, I'd have to pull the exact 
funding, and of course some of that will depend on how the 
States and project sponsors choose to allocate funding that 
could go either toward transit or highways in the formula case, 
and on the discretionary side, could go towards projects that 
are more or less highway intensive, but what I'll say also is 
that this legislation gives us the means to look beyond the 
1950s, 1960s, or 1970s mentality about transportation that 
often really subjected any mode other than single occupancy 
vehicles to the back burner, and when we do, as you wisely 
note, the benefit is not only in terms of more convenient, 
equitable, and decent ways to get around, but also the physical 
health of people who aren't subjected to as many emissions, 
when we have more thoughtful and more wide-ranging options for 
people to get around, including active transportation, and 
excellent public transit.
    Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Excellent point. Mr. Secretary, the 
GHG performance measure is a great step, but what else is DOT 
doing to help ensure that the IIJA is part of the solution to 
emissions and climate change?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, certainly I would point to the 
Carbon Reduction Program, which provides dedicated funding for 
the purpose of making transportation investments that reduce 
the carbon intensity of the U.S. transportation sector, but 
that's far from the only set of resources that are going to 
make a big difference. Again, pretty much any investment that 
you make in transit is likely to reduce carbon emissions, but 
it's that much more so on investments like the low- and no-
emission bus program, which helps local jurisdictions and 
transit authorities to acquire clean, efficient, electric, or 
otherwise low-emission buses for their routes, saving taxpayer 
money in the long run when they do so.
    We've got $7.5 billion for building out the electric 
charging infrastructure across the country, including, 
importantly, $2.5 billion which is allowing us to make 
community charging investments, knowing that there are some 
places, often low-income places, where fuel savings might mean 
the most to a family if they could access an EV, but where it 
might not yet be profitable to install one. And so, we think we 
can buy down that difference and stimulate access to EVs in 
multifamily dwellings, for example, and in dense neighborhoods 
just as we're building out that network across the U.S. on the 
longer stretches of highway. So, just about every corner of our 
infrastructure policy holds the promise of helping us combat 
the climate challenge, and we're committed to making sure that 
we do everything that the law provides for us to do in that 
regard.
    Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Absolutely. As you know, the 
transportation sector is one of the most unionized sectors in 
the country. Can you speak to how U.S. DOT is going to put 
those principles into practice?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Yes. We know that it's vitally 
important to do so, and I think that what we really need to 
make sure of is to engage all of the players who have an 
opportunity to participate in the workforce of the future, 
because this is not just a question of fairness, although 
that's reason enough to ensure that we are bringing in people 
from backgrounds that have been excluded from these labor 
opportunities in the past, and supporting high-paying, good 
jobs with the opportunity to join a union. But it's also simply 
going to be necessary in order for us to get the work done, 
because this will require more of the American people and the 
American workforce than perhaps any national undertaking since 
World War II.
    Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, and Mr. 
Chair, I yield back.
    Mr. Malinowski. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes Ms. Van 
Duyne for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Van Duyne. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I 
appreciate you being here today, Secretary Buttigieg. It's good 
to see you again, and I'm always going to call you mayor, just 
because that's how I know you. I appreciate you coming to the 
DFW Airport, and I'm glad that you were able to meet with my 
colleague from Texas. DFW Airport is smack-dab in the middle of 
my district. I'm a former board member, so, next time you come 
in town, more than 24 hours' notice would really be appreciated 
so that I can make sure that I'm actually there.
    Interesting comment about the EVs earlier from my colleague 
from New Jersey. The quote was made that as more people buy 
EVs, the price of gas goes down. Correct me if I'm mistaken, 
but we've got more people driving EVs now than we ever have in 
our history, and I haven't seen anything but gas prices go up. 
Part of the concern is as we continue to see the incentives for 
EV, they seem to be getting a free ride on our highways, even 
though because of their weight--considerable weight over ``gas-
guzzling''--to use that quote--other vehicles, that they're no 
doubt causing more damage to the roads.
    So, are you concerned that the weight of the EVs and their 
lack of paying for the roads that they're driving on--I mean, 
my chief concern is, OK, if less people are paying gas taxes 
because we're giving that pass to EVs, they're causing more of 
the damage, and we're not going to have the maintenance on 
that.
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, I think there are two sides of the 
coin to think about. On one hand, as you point out, EVs don't 
pay--if it's a fully electric vehicle, you're not paying the 
gas tax, which is traditionally how we've funded the Highway 
Trust Fund. On the other hand, we know that ultimately there 
will be less expense to Medicaid, for example, for fewer 
children suffering from asthma that's a consequence of living 
near areas that have a lot of traffic with traditional 
combustion vehicles. We know that there are very real dollars 
and cents costs to allowing climate change to continue to 
accelerate. And so, we need to balance those----
    Ms. Van Duyne [interrupting]. Yes, I'm concerned right now 
on paying for our infrastructure bill, this massive 
infrastructure bill that we just passed. And you just took away 
the pay-for if you're incentivizing them to drive EVs. We have 
no pay now, and they're causing a considerable amount of damage 
on the roads.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Right. So, a couple things here. One, 
as you know, the IIJA sought to use not increased user fees, 
but other sources of funding in order to make those investments 
possible. But two, this legislation, falling in line with 
previous transportation bills, created pilots for States to 
look at alternatives for how they want to fund their roads for 
those that rely on gas taxes, as many States do. And we 
recognize that different States are going to come up with 
different approaches here. We think we'll learn a lot from 
them. I think it's relatively early in that process, but we're 
interested to see the data.
    Ms. Van Duyne. Yes. The problem with it being early in the 
process is we've already passed the bill. We just don't have 
any way of paying for it. So, while we can set up these test 
projects in other States, the fact is, is that we're already 
going to have the debt, and we've got no pay-for for it.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, it's not that we have no pay-for 
for it, it's just that we will have less revenue from electric 
vehicles into the particular pay-for that has been favored by 
Congress----
    Ms. Van Duyne [interrupting]. Allocated for.
    Secretary Buttigieg [continuing]. In the past.
    Ms. Van Duyne. So, we're going to have to find it somewhere 
else in the budget.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Right, so, typically, it's been 
general fund, and that's one way to do it.
    Ms. Van Duyne [interposing]. Yes.
    Secretary Buttigieg. But far from the only way.
    Ms. Van Duyne. Yes. In many instances, you are empowered 
and directed by Congress to ensure that Federal laws protect 
transportation workers, passengers, and the movement of goods. 
Consistent Federal standards help to protect interstate 
commerce and prevent a State or circuit court from making 
decisions that would impact the entire country, or from 
creating conflicting standards around the country, which would 
make compliance confusing, impossible, or unnecessarily costly. 
Are you concerned about the challenges to the Department's 
Federal authority that would create a patchwork of State 
regulations? And specifically, I am talking about what's 
happening in California.
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, there's always a balance that we 
know has to be struck principally between Congress and the 
courts and the States on what ought to be a Federal power and 
what ought to be a State power. We think that often things seem 
to go best when the Federal standard amounts to a floor, not a 
ceiling, and then some States who want to make sure that 
there's even more done for the well-being of their workers, or 
for health or whatever the particular thing is that they 
regulate----
    Ms. Van Duyne [interrupting]. I'm sorry. My time is rapidly 
going down, but do you know how many DOT registered motor 
carriers have only one truck?
    Secretary Buttigieg. No, I don't.
    Ms. Van Duyne. So, it's about 300,000. So, as we continue 
to see crisis after crisis with our supply chain, what would 
happen to our supply chain in the country and these small 
business owners if the U.S. were to ban their ability to work 
as independent contractors for large motor carriers?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, we certainly need to find a way 
for them to be able to work effectively, if not in traditional 
models, then in new ones, but again, that's something that's 
being resolved between the courts and the State right now. 
We're not a party to that litigation.
    Ms. Van Duyne. So, you don't think that the DOT has any 
play in what's happening to basically cut our supply chain 
countrywide?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, of course we have a lot of play 
in what's happening to our supply chain. That's why I work on 
it all the time. We're just not party to the litigation.
    Ms. Van Duyne. No, but are you planning on getting involved 
at all, or are you just waiting for the courts to decide?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, we're working on dozens of 
things related to truckdriver availability, but in this 
particular regard, we're not a party to the litigation.
    Ms. Van Duyne. All right. All right, thank you very much.
    Ms. Norton [presiding]. The gentlewoman's time has expired. 
Five minutes, Mr. Auchincloss. You are recognized.
    Mr. Auchincloss. Thank you, Madam Chair. Secretary, welcome 
back. We appreciate your engagement in this hearing. And for 
me, as somebody who has worked in the future of mobility in the 
private sector and the public sector and academia, it's just so 
heartening to have a Secretary of the Transportation 
Department, a former mayor who took on parking minimums, and 
who understands that we need to move our infrastructure away 
from car-centric planning and development and towards a future 
of human-centric infrastructure and walkability.
    After the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, I 
held one on one meetings with leaders of every city and town in 
my district to hear about their infrastructure priorities. 
There are a lot, but one overarching one is expanding commuter 
rail access, and in Newton, Massachusetts, the commuter rail 
there, the three stations that comprise it is not currently 
fully ADA accessible. As your Department prepares to issue your 
NOFO for the All Stations Accessibility Program, can you 
discuss both the timeline for applications as well as the 
criteria that you'll use beyond local, State, and Federal 
alignment?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. The All Stations 
Accessibility Program is going to provide unprecedented 
dedicated resources to help upgrade legacy rail stations for 
people with disabilities. And it's worth noting that a great 
many legacy rail stations that were built before 1990 and the 
ADA are not accessible.
    In fact, about 25 percent, so that's 927 stations across 17 
systems remain inaccessible--I guess one of the reasons why we 
understand the sense of urgency about putting these dollars to 
work. This year's slice of the program, based on the funding 
Congress provided, will be about $350 million, and we're close 
to being able to put out the Notice of Funding Opportunity. As 
a matter of fact, I think by the end of the month we'll be able 
to do that. It's a new program every time, and we have over 40 
new programs. Of course, it takes a little more time to bring 
together than new iterations of the programs that had been 
there all along, but I still believe we'll be able to make 
award announcements by later on this year, and the NOFO will 
have more information about how we're going to prioritize, but 
I expect we'll get a lot of applications, because we know the 
need is very great.
    Mr. Auchincloss. Well, Secretary, I'd welcome you in the 
district to come tour the new commuter rail station and see the 
opportunities inherent in improving it. I'd like to also ask 
you about microtransit.
    This technology has helped transform communities by 
providing affordable and flexible transit solutions, often by 
ensuring critical connections to pre-existing transit hubs and 
filling so-called transit deserts in underserved urban and 
rural areas. And earlier this year, 14 of my colleagues and I 
sent you a letter urging you to provide flexibility in the IIJA 
programs for the inclusion of on-demand transit. I'd appreciate 
hearing your thoughts on how the Department is going to support 
and encourage the use of microtransit across the country as you 
implement the IIJA.
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, we've seen how beneficial and how 
filled with potential microtransit is. I think it's also safe 
to say it just wasn't what folks had in mind when most of our 
U.S. transportation policy and legislation was set up.
    So, part of what we're trying to do is find ways to flex 
funding within existing programs--to make clear, when we're 
confident that the law will allow for it--that jurisdictions 
can do this. A good example is CMAQ, the Congestion Mitigation 
and Air Quality funding, has a lot of flex eligibilities. But 
working with Federal highways, we think we can do that in a 
number of existing programs like the Highway Safety Improvement 
Program, and work it into some of the new ones that we're 
bringing online, like the Safe Streets for All Program.
    We've seen successful micromobility programs all over the 
country, including I would note not just in cities where I 
think people easily imagine scooters or e-bikes being used, but 
also in rural areas from Alabama to Delaware. And we also have 
some FTA research and demonstration funds that in certain 
circumstances could be used to help here.
    And I think this really is part of the answer for the long 
run on how that first or last mile works for people interacting 
with the transit system going forward. So, we're going to do 
everything we can to be flexible and supportive here.
    Mr. Auchincloss. That's terrific, and I would also add that 
in addition to micromobility, on-demand transit as well, to 
fill those transit deserts, is critical. I want to give you, 
Secretary, the last 30 seconds just to talk about airline 
staffing. I know you are frustrated. My constituents are 
frustrated, and I am frustrated about the cancellations. You 
have been on top of it. Can you explain what you are working on 
this summer?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. Yes. We were especially 
concerned after the Memorial Day travel weekend disruptions 
that happened here. And it is clear that while we welcome the 
fact that demand has returned, passengers are going back on 
those vacations that they had put off either because of 
financial or direct COVID concerns or both, we are seeing now 
that the airlines aren't prepared to meet that demand in many 
cases.
    Also, we have seen a number of steps since those 
conversations that I had with airline leadership that I think 
are very positive. We have seen increased pay, including a lot 
of regional carriers, which have struggled most to hold onto 
pilots. We have seen more attention going into customer service 
and staffing customer service. And on the FAA side, we are 
working on anything we can do to make sure that air traffic 
control resources are allocated in ways that are helpful too.
    Mr. Auchincloss [interrupting]. Secretary, I am----
    Secretary Buttigieg. There is a long way to go.
    Mr. Auchincloss. I am over time, so, I have to cut you off 
there. Maybe another Member wants to give you some time more to 
talk about airline staffing, but I yield back, Madam Chair.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you.
    Ms. Norton. The gentleman yields back.
    I recognize Mr. Rouzer for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Rouzer. Thank you, Madam Chair, and Mr. Secretary, 
great to see you. It is good to have you here in person in the 
committee. I think this might be one of the first committee 
hearings we have had where the witnesses have been here live or 
the witness is here live. So, thank you for being here.
    I will get right to the point, but I'll preface that with 
this: We all understand that you need to have rules for the 
road, but you don't necessarily need a stoplight every 10 feet. 
And that kind of sums up my philosophy as it relates to 
regulatory structure. And to that end, I note that, according 
to the Council on Environmental Quality, the average time for 
an EIS or environmental impact statement under the NEPA process 
was more than 7 years for FAA and the Federal Highway 
Administration projects before the Trump administration 
streamlined NEPA in 2020.
    But of course, as you know, this administration has 
reversed those efforts as it relates to NEPA. And so, I am just 
curious. How do we reconcile the immediate need for big 
infrastructure projects with the administration's efforts to 
prolong and really delay important projects? Time is money. And 
there are a number of us that feel like those NEPA reforms were 
very much needed and very helpful had they been allowed to be 
implemented fully rather than being reversed.
    Secretary Buttigieg. We think that we can deliver projects 
promptly and swiftly without throwing environmental or other 
concerns out the window. And we are committed to finding ways 
to make sure that the process goes as smoothly as possible. The 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides a lot of the terms for 
doing that, including starting a short clock on a process that 
we met, I think, within 60 days on categorical exclusions as 
well as things that are going to be more long term in terms of 
measures to make the process easier to navigate or make it 
simpler in some way.
    I do want to point out that, on our transportation--
certainly our Federal highway programs, 98 percent of them fall 
under a categorical exclusion, which means we can usually turn 
that around in about a month. But there are those longer EIS 
and EA processes where the--as you say, time is money. And it 
is very important, while meeting the requirements of the law, 
making sure that the processes have been followed that there is 
no unnecessary delay or redundancy. And I think, again, the 
infrastructure law sets us up for that by calling for that 2-
year median or average. We are working to make sure we are on 
track for that and other measures that I think will help too.
    Mr. Rouzer. Well, all that sounds good. But I don't really 
think, in practicality, that is truly the case. But for time's 
sake, I need to move on to a couple other things. With regard 
to the short line freight rail industry, a couple things as it 
relates to this. Obviously, you are familiar with the 
Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements Grant 
Program. The infrastructure bill added some more resources for 
that.
    Can you comment on the Department's commitment towards 
using that particular program to invest in key safety goals 
like allowing short line freight rail to upgrade and make 
important repairs? And then a quick followup to that: Do you 
agree the program helps short line railroads improve the 
efficiency of the supply chain?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, thanks for the question. I think 
short line railroads are more important than ever, as we have 
seen in the context of the renewed attention to the supply 
chain. So, we need to make sure that we are supporting them. 
Around the time we rolled out the CRISI Grants for this year, I 
had the pleasure of visiting one in Michigan. And we know there 
are similar ones across the country. So, when it comes to the 
CRISI program, which our last round was $368 million. And we 
will have that much more funding thanks to the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law. We certainly see that this is going to be a 
very important source of support for all railroads, certainly 
to include short lines.
    Mr. Rouzer. Yes. Given that is the case, I am a little bit 
perplexed, though, that the Department is moving forward with a 
new crew staffing rule that could require railroads to hire 
more personnel or operate with more people in the train than is 
necessary. Now, if that goes forward, over time, it could force 
hundreds of small business short line freight railroads to make 
artificial and inefficient economic and management decisions 
instead of putting those resources into capital improvements--
to track, for example--structures that are critical for the 
efficient movement of goods and services. Why is U.S. DOT 
considering forcing these small businesses to hire workers they 
don't need when, in fact, quite frankly, it is hard to find a 
worker anyway?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, the reason for the rule is 
safety. And I don't want to preempt what is coming. I think, 
any day now, actually, in terms of NPRM that will have more of 
the specifics. But the intention here is to make sure that we 
continue to meet our fundamental obligation as a Department to 
ensure that we have safety for workers and anybody who comes 
into contact with our rail system while being as 
straightforward and as reasonable as possible for the benefit 
of goods movement and fluidity.
    Mr. Rouzer. Well, again, that sounds good. But I don't 
necessarily think--in fact, I know that is not necessary. They 
ought to be allowed to invest their resources in areas where it 
is going to create more efficiency and allow for us to overcome 
these supply chain challenges.
    Madam Chair, my time has expired. I yield back.
    Ms. Norton. The gentleman yields back.
    I recognize Ms. Bourdeaux. Ms. Bourdeaux, you are 
recognized for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Bourdeaux. Thank you so much, and thank you, Madam 
Chairman, Ranking Member, for holding today's hearing. And 
thank you, Secretary Buttigieg, for being here today. Mr. 
Secretary, I want to start by thanking you for visiting 
Georgia's Seventh Congressional District last summer. It was a 
pleasure to have you and show you all the innovative work going 
on at Peachtree Corners around autonomous vehicles and electric 
charging. And please know that you are always welcome back.
    Last year, members of this committee and our colleagues in 
the Senate came together to pass the Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act, a historic and bipartisan once-in-a-generation 
investment in our Nation's physical infrastructure.
    Like many of my colleagues here today, I was proud to 
support this legislation, and I am grateful for the 
administration's partnership in getting the money out the door 
to our partners on the ground. There is a lot to talk about 
here. But just to focus on a couple issues that are really 
important to Georgia's Seventh Congressional District, one is 
microtransit. And the other is electric vehicles.
    I know that you have already answered some of my questions 
about microtransit when some other of my colleagues asked them 
earlier. I just want to reiterate it is very, very important. 
My district is a suburban community. It has been hard to get 
consensus around bus rapid transit, other forms of transit. And 
so, microtransit is very, very helpful, particularly for our 
cities, which form these important hubs all over the district.
    And I hear from people all the time about how much they 
really appreciate the microtransit we have been able to get in 
and how much more they would like to see of that particular 
innovation in our community. Talking about electric vehicles, 
very proud of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure 
Program and glad to see that the State of Georgia received 
nearly $20 million in fiscal year 2022 as a part of $135 
million over 5 years to support efforts to expand EV charging 
across the State. So, just touching on that for a few minutes, 
could you talk a little bit about whether there have been 
hurdles getting the new National Electric Vehicle 
Infrastructure Program off the ground and then also, how the 
administration has prioritized consumer experience to ensure it 
is easy, consistent, and mirrors their current experience at 
the pump?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, thank you. First of all, thank 
you for the great visit we had to Georgia and some very 
impressive things we saw both in terms of policy and in terms 
of technology on the ground. And as your question hints, there 
is tons of opportunity but a lot of challenge in getting it 
right with this electric vehicle infrastructure, especially 
because we have not had something like this at scale in the 
U.S.
    It is very different from the infrastructure for fueling 
gas cars, and we need to be mindful of that as we go. One thing 
we are thinking about in particular with regard to the consumer 
experience is making sure that these charging stations are 
interoperable and are available. You can imagine if you are 
taking a road trip and every third or fourth gas pump didn't 
work. Or if you had to be a member of a particular gas station 
chain in order to even use the pump, that would not be a 
positive or efficient experience.
    But in some places and in some cases in the past, that is 
what some EV drivers have faced. And so, we need to make sure 
that we are not only getting the dots in the right places on 
the maps but paying attention to the quality as well as the 
quantity of these EV charging stations, especially those that 
would be supported with taxpayer funds. So, those are some of 
the things that are on our mind as we work in close 
collaboration with my colleagues at the Department of Energy 
through these issues.
    And I have to say it is, in my view, a remarkably positive 
example of interagency cooperation to see how the Department of 
Energy has teamed up with the DOT to work through these 
issues--some where we have more expertise, some where they have 
more expertise--put our heads together and get a good plan 
going to meet the President's goals.
    Ms. Bourdeaux. And just to follow up on that, we recently 
had a company, Siemens, that rolled out some innovative new 
electric charging infrastructure that can be easily deployed to 
gas stations or convenience stores. But the challenge is the 
grid and the ability to plug into the grid. So, we can get the 
basic technology on the ground. What is going on with that? How 
are you all thinking about integrating the overhaul of the grid 
that is required in order to support electric vehicle charging?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, there is no way we are going to 
be able to run tomorrow's cars on yesterday's grid. And it is 
one of the reasons why we are thankful for the ways that the 
infrastructure law contemplates and supports upgrades for 
America's electrical infrastructure. And here I will yield to 
the Department of Energy, which has more of the day-to-day 
expertise on this work. But again, we are integrating it with 
our work on the EV side through that joint office.
    And we know that is vitally important because we need to 
have the backbone of electric infrastructure to support the 
electric charging infrastructure that we are funding.
    Ms. Bourdeaux. Thank you.
    Ms. Norton. The gentlewoman's time has expired.
    I recognize Mrs. Steel for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Steel. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Ranking 
Member Graves. Once again, California State has 40 percent of 
the Nation's imported goods and 30 percent of the Nation's 
exported goods moving through just two of its ports, Los 
Angeles and Long Beach.
    It is implementing AB5, a law that will worsen the Nation's 
supply chain crisis by upending the independent contractor 
model used by the trucking industry. Mr. Secretary, as AB5 
would impact 70,000 truckers alone just in California, what is 
your Department doing to lessen the impact of this bill on our 
national economy?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, the availability of trucking 
workers is a critically important part of the supply chain 
challenge. It is one of the reasons why we have been working on 
this from day one, taking measures both to help recruit new 
truckdrivers and to support the kind of job quality 
improvements that we believe will help us to retain more 
truckdrivers in the career. Our Bureau of Transportation 
Statistics estimates that some 300,000 people leave the 
profession on a yearly basis. And we have taken steps that we 
think have successfully helped to move the needle on some of 
those systemic challenges.
    So, we are going to continue those efforts. They are all in 
line with the President's Trucking Action Plan. And we will 
continue doing that as we wait for more information and 
guidance from the State of California about State policies.
    Mrs. Steel. Shortage of drivers is part of it. But not just 
a shortage of drivers. In California, these independent 
truckers cannot really come in. So, you are cochair of the 
Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force. And I know that you 
developed the Trucking Action Plan. But I haven't seen you and 
other members of the administration encourage the ILWU, 
International Longshore and Warehouse Union, and PMA, Pacific 
Maritime Association, to come to the table to keep freight 
flowing through L.A. and Long Beach. Why aren't you doing the 
same for independent truckers, because, as of now, we have such 
a shortage of truckers, and these independent truckers can come 
in. I think that is going to reduce our supply chain crisis 
much more. So, why shouldn't they get the same type of 
exemptions that gig workers and entertainers get who are an 
impetus for the law?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, again, to the extent that this 
is a State law, we respect the role of the State of the 
California. We are in touch with them, and we know that they 
have indicated that the California Labor Agency is working with 
those who need assistance coming into compliance and that they 
are looking at the supply chain factors too. This is one piece 
of a very big puzzle, and we are doing everything we can on the 
pieces that are up to us federally while respecting the areas 
in which we are not formally part of the process.
    Mrs. Steel. So, you are not really working with--Governor 
Newsom just visited last week here. And you never had a meeting 
with him that--you know what--he could not actually declare the 
state of emergency by pass--AB5. So, it is going to actually 
loosen a little more of the supply chain crisis. So, you never 
really did that. And what that California Trucking Association 
sue [inaudible] refused to hear that what that is going to--
really impacting for this supply chain crisis.
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, again, we are not part of the 
lawsuit that you referred to. We are not a party to it. And it 
doesn't have a Federal procedural role in that sense. We are, 
obviously, continuing to monitor anything and everything that 
can affect throughput in our ports or in any part of the goods 
movement system in the U.S. And we will work with any party 
that has ideas or has needs in order to make sure that goods 
keep moving as they need to.
    Mrs. Steel. Just my last question is so you have a 
communication [inaudible] between the California Governor's 
Office and your Department to solve this problem?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, we will respect the role of the 
State but always be prepared to engage on anything we can do to 
be supportive or helpful toward the goal of making sure there 
is good throughput.
    Mrs. Steel. Thank you very much. I yield back.
    Ms. Norton. The gentlewoman yields back. I recognize Mr. 
DeSaulnier for 5 minutes. You are recognized.
    Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I appreciate 
that. Mr. Secretary, it is delightful to see you. Thank you for 
your really extraordinary work on this. We sort of miss, I 
think--some of my colleagues have mentioned the historic nature 
of this and how difficult it has been for both Republican and 
Democratic administrations to get this bill. I want to 
specifically talk to you as somebody who served three different 
Governors in the California Air Resources Board and served on 
the California Transportation Commission, has put a lot of time 
in the last 25 years in alternative fuels and our renewable 
portfolio standard.
    And I was also the author, some of the conversation in the 
legislature about the VMT bill with the full expectation that 
that's where we would recover our funding. California has 42 
percent of the EV and fuel cell market in the United States. 
But we have the chicken-and-egg problem with infrastructure. 
So, I want to talk to you about that. I was very, very happy 
that a bill that's a priority of mine was incorporated into the 
infrastructure bill, the Clean Corridors bill, to provide this 
infrastructure. We have a proportionate amount of 
infrastructure but putting it in the right place to make it 
effective.
    And we can see this in the private sector. And Madam Chair, 
I would like to submit for the record an article from Forbes 
magazine that is entitled ``Every Automaker's EV Plans Through 
2035 and Beyond'' if I could.
    Ms. Norton. It has been received.

    There's no longer any doubt that the auto industry is going 
electric. Every international automaker is introducing battery cars, 
and plug-in hybrid options are increasingly part of model lines. But 
some auto companies have gone further, and actually set dates for when 
they will produce only ``electrified'' cars (batteries and hybrids) 
and/or pure EVs. Others have set dates certain when they're going to 
stop developing internal-combustion engines. Some have already stopped.
    Here, in alphabetical order, is a rundown of where all the world's 
automakers stand on going electric. Obviously, we're not including 
startup companies such as Lucid, Rivian, Bollinger and Fisker. Like 
Tesla, they're all-electric from Day One and Job One.
    There are three levels of electrification. A hybrid vehicle uses 
gasoline and a bit of electricity; the battery drives the car a mile or 
two and recharges when the car slows or goes downhill. Hybrid vehicles 
boost fuel economy but they're not seen as a long-term solution. A 
plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV or plug-in) uses a battery about 
10 times as big as a hybrid and can drive the car 20 to 50 miles before 
the gasoline engine kicks in, meaning it can be a full-electric as a 
commuter car Monday to Friday, then act as a traditional car on 
weekends. It's a bridge technology good through 2030 or 2040. A battery 
electric vehicle (EV or BEV) runs only on battery power; the largest 
batteries are five to 10 times as big as a plug-in's battery. Hydrogen 
fuel cells can also produce electricity for propulsion.
    EVs and PHEVs need chargers and both are eligible for federal tax 
credits of up to $7,500 if the battery is big enough.
                                Bentley
    Perhaps the most unlikely candidate for early electrification on 
this list, Bentley is nevertheless all in. By 2026, all its cars will 
be plug-in hybrids or all-electric, and by 2030, goodbye tailpipes. 
According to CEO Adrian Hallmark, ``The future of Bentley will be fully 
electric. By 2030, no more combustion engines. We are not only working 
on one electric car but a full family of electric cars.'' Bentley's 
first EV will arrive in 2025, and it's expected to be an SUV built on 
the VW Group's Artemis platform.
                                  BMW
    The automaker from Bavaria is a holdout among the German carmakers 
in terms of fully electric vehicles, as opposed to here-and-now plug-
ins. CEO Oliver Zipse says that gas engine development will continue 
and that demand for internal combustion ``will remain robust for many 
years to come'' and most of BMW's top-selling models have plug-in 
versions, including the X3, X5, 3 Series, 5 Series and 7 Series. But 
BMW is undoubtedly BEV-electrifying, too. Zipse also said, in March, 
``By the end of 2025, we will have delivered a total of around two 
million fully electric vehicles to customers. We will also be growing 
our sales of fully electric models by well over 50% per year over the 
next few years--more than 10 times the figure for 2020.'' By 2030, the 
company said approximately half its global sales will be battery cars. 
The electric iX SUV and i4 sedan are both market-bound now. For the 
high-end European makers--Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche--they 
justified lofty prices with high levels of performance and technology. 
Now technology encompasses zero-emissions performance.
                                  Ford
    The automaker made a big splash with the F-150 Lightning, an 
electric version of the best-selling vehicle in the U.S., in part 
because it will offer 230 miles of range for less than $40,000. A small 
hybrid truck called the Maverick is also very competitively priced 
($19,995). Ford is investing $22 billion through 2025 to deliver 
battery EVs, and plans to be carbon neutral by 2050, but the company 
still sees a role for hybrids with gas engines.
                             General Motors
    The General says it plans to stop selling gas and diesel vehicles 
by 2035. GM admits it's an aspirational goal. But Cadillac is deeply 
committed. The division said in April that it plans to offer no new 
models with internal-combustion engines, but will update some existing 
vehicles. And by 2030, the Cadillac lineup will be all-electric. The 
first offering will be the Lyriq crossover SUV next year. The electric 
Hummers, in pickup and SUV form, are coming, with pickup production to 
begin this fall. Chevrolet also recently updated the Bolt EV, and an 
electric version of the Silverado truck is coming in 2023 or 2024 with 
400 miles of range from its Ultium batteries. GM's carbon neutrality is 
planned by 2040.
                                 Honda
    The Japanese automaker will sell only EVs and hybrids in Europe 
after 2022. By 2030, Honda says 40 percent of its North American 
vehicle sales will be either battery electric or hydrogen, and by 2040 
all gas cars will be phased out. Honda's first two EVs (one Honda SUV 
called the Prologue, one Acura) in 2024 will be built by GM, but 
according to Dave Gardner, a North American vice president, ``It's 
absolutely our intention to produce in our factories. We absolutely 
intend to utilize that resource.'' Honda is one of a handful of 
automakers pushing hydrogen (fuel cells) instead of batteries as fuel 
sources. The company has been building Clarity fuel cell electric 
vehicles (FCEVs) since 2008; the Clarity name also applies to 
traditional EVs and plug-ins.
                              Hyundai-Kia
    The Hyundai Motor Group hasn't made a commitment to go all-
electric, but it said that it would invest $7.4 billion to produce 
future EVs in the U.S. by 2025. Hyundai's EV production is to continue 
with the Hyundai Ioniq 5 in the fall and the Kia EV6 in 2022. A 50 
percent cut in internal-combustion models was announced in May. Hyundai 
has also made a big commitment to fuel cells, especially in its Korean 
home market. Kia is promising seven dedicated battery electrics by the 
end of 2027, and plans global sales of half a million battery cars 
annually by 2026. EVs (including hybrids) are expected to be 25 percent 
of global sales in 2029. In South Korea, North America and Europe, EVs 
will be 20 percent of Kia sales by 2025. Hyundai believes fuel cell 18-
wheelers make more sense for cross-country runs than heavy batteries 
and in 2019 showed the Hyundai HDC-6 Neptune concept, a self-driving 
(except the first and last miles) hydrogen truck with onboard bunk, 
toilet and shower. Since the fuel cell's exhaust is water, the shower 
never runs out. This year, Hyundai deployed a small fleet of more 
mainstream Hyundai XCient fuel-cell 18-wheelers in California. No 
onboard shower.
                           Jaguar Land Rover
    Under a plan called ``Reimagine,'' the brand will be all-electric, 
with battery versions of the whole lineup by 2030, with $3.4 billion 
investment annually in new technology. JLR already fields the Jaguar I-
Pace, a new version of which will likely sit on the company's new 
Electric Modular Architecture (EMA) platform. There will be an electric 
Land Rover in 2024, then an electric Range Rover. In total, there will 
be six electric Land Rovers over the next five years. A plan to build 
an electric Jaguar XJ sedan was scuttled.
                                 Mazda
    Under the unforgettable moniker ``Sustainable Zoom-Zoom 2030,'' 
Mazda will aim for carbon neutrality by 2050. The company said it would 
continue to develop internal-combustion powertrains, but will also 
introduce a unique EV platform, SkyActive EV Scalable Architecture, in 
2025. The platform will be used for five hybrids, five plug-in hybrids, 
and three battery EVs by 2025 in the U.S., China and the ASEAN 
(Southeast Asian) countries. ``We assume that 100% of our products will 
have some level of electrification, and our EV ratio will be 25% by 
2030,'' Mazda said. The company's first EV is the MX-30 subcompact 
crossover, which will also have a plug-in hybrid variant. It goes on 
sale in the U.S. this fall, initially in California.
                             Mercedes-Benz
    Starting in 2025, Mercedes said, all new vehicle platforms will be 
EV-only. CEO Ola Kallenius told Reuters, ``We really want to go for it 
. . . and be dominantly, if not all electric, by the end of the 
decade.'' He added that spending on gasoline technology will be ``close 
to zero'' by 2025. And 2030 is a goal for going fully EV, but Kallenius 
didn't give a hard deadline for banishing all traces of fossil fuels. 
Mercedes is expecting that its investments in combustion engines and 
plug-in hybrids will be reduced 80% by 2026. Total investment in EVs 
between 2022 and 2030 will be more than 40 billion euros ($47 billion). 
The 2022 Mercedes EQS electric luxury sedan arrives in showrooms this 
fall.
                               Mitsubishi
    The Japanese automaker was a pioneer with the I-MiEV electric sedan 
and Outlander plug-in hybrid. In April, it showed the Airtrek ``e-
cruising SUV,'' designed for the Chinese market, at the Shanghai Motor 
Show. With Nissan (see below) shifting to CCS charging starting with 
the Ariya, that leaves the Outlander as the only vehicle in the U.S. 
still using CHAdeMO.
                                 Nissan
    Nissan's Leaf was another early electric entry. The company now 
says it will have eight EVs on the road by the end of 2023, and plans 
to eventually be selling a million hybrid or electric cars annually 
around the world. In early July, it announced EV36Zero, a  1 billion 
($N1.3 billion) Electric Vehicle Hub, in Sunderland, England, where it 
will build an all-electric crossover. The hub is designed to bring 
together EVs, battery production and renewable energy. Nissan's EV 
lineup will expand this year with an SUV called the Ariya, which boasts 
300-mile range and an 87-kilowatt-hour battery pack. Nissan EVs in the 
US starting with Ariya will ditch the proprietary CHAdeMO port in favor 
of the CCS (Combined Charging System) charging port that everybody else 
(except, of course, Tesla) uses. That would get the charging-plug war 
down to two combatants, Tesla and CCS, and make it easier for the 
government via the $1 trillion infrastructure plan to build out, or 
support, a nationwide charging network.
                              Rolls-Royce
    Rolls is reportedly working on a first-EV called the Silent Shadow, 
based on the Phantom. It's expected to use technology from the new BMW 
iX SUV. BMW CEO Oliver Zipse said in July that EVs will be offered ``in 
90% of segments--from the compact class to the ultra-luxury segment.'' 
For BMW, ultra-luxury is Rolls-Royce.
                  Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler)
    The old Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) was a slacker when it came 
to EVs, but now as Stellantis it's getting into gear. Stellantis plans 
to invest more than $35.5 billion in EVs through 2025. An all-electric 
full-sized Ram 1500 pickup will arrive in 2024, the same year as an 
electric Dodge performance car. Every Jeep will have an EV option by 
2025. The Grand Cherokee 4xe plug-in hybrid will be shown at this 
year's New York Auto Show, as a 2022 model. The Jeep Wrangler 4xe plug-
in hybrid is on the market now, selling well, and a Wrangler Magneto EV 
concept was shown. Stellantis will have 55 electrified cars and trucks 
for sale in the U.S. and Europe by 2025. It is planning that 70% of its 
European sales, and 40% of its American, will be either battery 
electric or plug-in hybrid within four years. But it hasn't given an 
all-electric date.
                                 Toyota
    Toyota (with a big bet on fuel cells) said that its Toyota bZ4X 
Concept electric SUV, developed with Subaru and shown in Texas in June, 
is ``the vision for the first of a global series of battery-electric 
vehicles to be introduced under the Toyota bZ brand umbrella.'' Toyota 
will have 70 electrified models by 2025, 15 of them battery EVs and 
seven of them with the Beyond Zero bZ brand. Pickups will also get 
electrified, and Toyota has the goal of being carbon neutral by 2050. 
Toyota is the market leader among hybrids--the top five sellers are the 
Toyotas RAV4, Highlander, Prius and Camry hybrids plus the Honda CR-V--
which (Prius especially) got the world thinking about electrification.
                               Volkswagen
    The Volkswagen brand says that battery EVs will be 70% of its sales 
in Europe in 2030, up from a projected 35%. For the U.S. and China, the 
VW brand goal is more than 50% full-electric vehicle sales by 2030. The 
VW Group has 70 new electrified models in the pipeline, and several 
already on the market (including the Porsche Taycan, Audi e-tron and VW 
ID. 4). One of these coming soon is the sporty Project Trinity electric 
car, with a launch date of 2026. Audi's Project Artemis is to launch a 
``highly efficient'' EV by 2024. VW said that 2026 will be the last 
year it launches a combustion platform.
                                 Volvo
    The Swedish automaker will make only electric cars by 2030. The 
sales strategy will also change: ``All fully electric models will be 
available online only,'' the company said. Volvo's first all-electric 
car, the XC40 Recharge, was launched in 2020. But parent Geely also 
fields Polestar (Volvo now owns 49.5%). It's an all-electrified 
performance luxury brand, with Polestar 1 (an exclusive plug-in hybrid) 
and Polestar 2 (on the same platform as the XC40 Recharge). By 2025, 
Volvo said half of its global sales will be fully electric, with the 
rest hybrids.

Table shows dates automakers say their lineups will comprise only plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and
  battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), then only BEVs. Automakers have answered these questions in different ways,
  such as describing when the last gas or diesel (combustion) platform comes to market instead of when the maker
  will be 100% BEV. Hybrids do not count as electrified vehicles here. Source: Automakers

    Automakers have varied dates for shifting from combustion-engine 
vehicles toward plug-in hybrids and EVs, then going EV-only. The China 
market is a third bigger than the U.S. market, 20 million registrations 
vs. 14 million last year (Europe combined had 12 million). China and 
Europe want EVs sooner, and no automaker can ignore them. The go-
electric dates above may compress further.

    Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you. Let me just read--this is from 
Forbes magazine. So, for my colleagues who wonder where the 
marketplace is going and respect the marketplace, the 
marketplace is clearly going away from internal combustion 
engines. There is a place for it. There is a transition.
    But this isn't pie in the sky, as somebody who has been 
involved with this, and realizes the frustration with battery 
technology. We are also just on the cusp of exponential change 
on affordability and range and durability on battery-electric. 
So, the beginning sentence of this article in Forbes magazine 
is, and I quote, ``There's no longer any doubt that the auto 
industry is going electric.''
    So, to your point about Brandeis and States being the 
laboratories of discovery, I understand that different States 
are going to have different pathways. We are, as you--I am 
sure--know, in places like the bay area, early adapters. The 
car companies tell me that. That is why we are moving to this. 
Not better or worse. It is just the marketplace.
    So, how do we get this infrastructure, in a thoughtful way, 
out to make it work? The Chinese are adding 4,000 EV stations a 
day. They are adding over 100,000 EV and fuel cell stations a 
month. We have a little over 100,000 in the United States. So, 
the private sector is going in and trying to fill this out. But 
when I talk to the private sector, both the car manufacturers 
and the energy manufacturers, we in California have our 
renewable portfolio standard. So, it is now going to 50 percent 
by 2030. So, from well to wheel, getting that energy clean and 
efficient. And then the point I think we miss here is the 
importance of our economy to transition to this energy source 
and to do it efficiently.
    So, how do we do that in the significant investment in this 
bill that you have been such a leader on and do it but in a 
thoughtful way. Those 12 States that represent over 60 percent 
of GDP and the vehicle market in the United States that follows 
CARB's leadership under the California waiver, the Clean Air 
Act, how do we strategically do this?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, I agree that one thing is certain, 
which is this is where industry is headed, and this is where 
the world is headed. I think, while that one thing is certain, 
at least three important things are not. Will it happen quickly 
enough to meet our climate challenge? Will it happen in a way 
that America leads? And will it happen in a way that is 
equitable for everyone?
    And those are the considerations that guide our 
involvement, things like the Federal support for charging 
stations. If we get it right, what we will be doing is 
accelerating it so that it helps us meet our climate goals. 
Presenting an American alternative to that Chinese model that 
you mentioned is gathering steam there.
    And reach people who might otherwise be left out of the 
transition at least in its early stages. Knowing some of the 
upfront costs that are involved, knowing the charging 
infrastructure isn't often available in lower income areas, 
even though, provided they could afford to purchase or use an 
EV, it is low-income drivers who would benefit the most from 
the fuel savings that come with having one.
    So, those are the principles that guide the way that we are 
framing both the $5 billion in formula funds that the States 
will execute according to their plans and then the $2.5 billion 
for discretionary work that we will do to effectively fill in 
the gaps in communities. And we think, taken together, we have 
the tools that will allow us to then stimulate that much more 
private sector involvement too, which can help make sure we 
actually do this as quickly as the economy and the climate need 
us to.
    Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you. Exciting. I yield back.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you.
    Ms. Norton. The gentleman's time has expired.
    I recognize Mr. Weber for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Weber of Texas. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Secretary, 
good to see you here today. I want to quote some of the things 
you said in your comments at the very end: ``Together, we have 
the opportunity to improve countless lives, support good-paying 
jobs, strengthen America's manufacturers, modernize our 
infrastructure for decades to come, and cement America's 
position as the world's leading economy,'' all good goals.
    And we recognize the administration's aim at reducing GHGs 
and coming down to as many [inaudible] as possible. I am from 
Texas, the gulf coast of Texas. We produce about 65 percent of 
the Nation's jet fuel through my six ports that I represent, 
more than any other Member of Congress. So, energy for us is a 
big deal. Texas is the number one wind energy State in the 
country. And I think you might have even alluded to or somebody 
else did. We are number two in solar panels, right behind 
California.
    But we are working on that. We will get there. We will get 
there. So, I appreciate you being here and bringing this all 
up. I want to bring a couple of projects to your attention that 
are called Sea Port Oil Terminals. What they do is they move 
product through pipeline out off the shore. It could be 20 
miles, 15, 20, 30 miles.
    And so, what happens then is they move the product cleaner. 
We are going to use oil and natural gas for a while, for a long 
while. You are seeing what is happening overseas. You got to 
know the Europeans would rather buy from us than from Russia. 
What I tell people is that fossil fuels--not the enemy. 
Greenhouse gas emissions are. And we are able to produce it 
probably cleaner than most other countries in the world.
    So, we have a chance to move this product offshore. We move 
it faster so it gets to the very large crude containers 
offshore. Right now, the other countries in the world are 
building huge ships, and they can't come up our canals, our 
channels, into our ports. So, what has to happen is they take 
smaller ships called lightering. You have probably heard the 
term. And they are having to go back and forth numbers of times 
while this huge container sits out there, diesel engines idling 
most of the time.
    And then you are going to have small ships that are having 
to make three or four trips, again, diesel engines idling. So, 
we can move it faster, less greenhouse gas emissions. We can 
move it safer. There is no--much 18-wheelers on the road. There 
are no 18-wheeler crashes. There are no tank cars overturning.
    I think you actually talked to Mr. Graves about his 
district with some wreck in his district. And you have to know 
that allies across the world would like this. It helps us with 
our imbalance of trade. We actually get to refine product and 
sell it, move it around the world. With decades to come, we are 
going to have a lot of natural gas, clean natural gas. And you 
know this. A lot of these ships are converting to LNG. So, we 
want this ability. All that to say that a couple of these 
businesses have been in contact with your chief of staff. I 
believe it is Laura Schiller. And is she with you today?
    Secretary Buttigieg. She is not here today, but she is our 
chief of staff.
    Mr. Weber of Texas. She had good enough sense to stay away 
from this place, didn't she? And then I think your general 
counsel, John Putnam----
    Secretary Buttigieg [interposing]. Mm-hmm.
    Mr. Weber of Texas [continuing]. Is he with you today?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Not at the hearing, I don't think.
    Mr. Weber of Texas. OK. Well, very good.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Keep him pretty busy back at 
headquarters.
    Mr. Weber of Texas. Well, all of that to say we talked 
about the permitting process earlier on with some of our 
colleagues up here. And we'd like to move that as quickly as we 
can because time is of the essence. And we want to make sure 
that we can reduce that permitting process time down to the 
least amount. Everybody wants a clean environment. You probably 
don't know this about the gulf coast of Texas, but we have got 
a lot of hunters and fishermen and stuff like that.
    We want good, clean, pristine lands to do all of those 
things to pass on for our kids. So, what I would like to do is 
to give you [indicating report]--this is actually a report on 
what we call SPOT, the Sea Port Oil Terminal, a project in the 
national interest, because we can produce it cleaner, faster. 
It helps us with our imbalance of trade and actually does a 
good job for the economy while protecting the environment and 
then see if I could follow back up with you in the coming days 
to see if you can kind of get me an update on where both of 
these projects are. And any questions from you? We've got 23 
seconds.
    Secretary Buttigieg. No. I would be happy to do that. We 
have got, I know, a lot of permits or license requests in with 
the Maritime Administration. And I would be happy to find out 
where these two sit among those and certainly appreciate the 
complexity of the transition you are describing.
    Mr. Weber of Texas. Well, thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank 
you for being here. And I'll get this over to you, and I yield 
back.
    Ms. Norton. The gentleman's time has expired.
    I recognize Mr. Moulton for 5 minutes. You are recognized, 
Mr. Moulton.
    Mr. Moulton. Thank you very much, Madam Chair.
    Mr. Secretary, good to see you. Thank you very much for 
being here. The IIJA appropriated more money for investing in 
rail than ever before in our Nation's history. Now, President 
Biden vowed to, quote, ``make sure that America has the 
cleanest, safest and fastest rail system in the world.'' Will 
this indeed be the administration's legacy? How will you 
fulfill the administration's promise, the President's promise?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, thank you. We are enthusiastic 
about the opportunities here for passenger rail. As you know, 
in any other administration, I might count myself the biggest 
enthusiast. But I will only ever be second place in this 
administration in terms of readiness and commitment to seeing 
America have the highest quality rail.
    As you mentioned, we have got unprecedented resources to 
work with here, the most since the inception of Amtrak itself. 
A lot of that is candidly dealing with backlog, dealing with 
the underinvestment that has happened in the past but also 
opportunities for new high-speed rail in the U.S. And we think 
that seeing is believing. The sooner people can see successful 
high-speed rail deployed on American soil, the sooner----
    Mr. Moulton [interrupting]. I have made this case for a 
long time. I completely agree with you. In the May 
appropriations hearing on the DOT budget, you said that, 
through the IIJA, you hope to establish high-speed rail, quote, 
``in at least two or three geographies.'' Have you identified 
those corridors yet?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, I can tell you that FRA has been 
in dialogue with a number of project sponsors or involved in 
some way in a number of high-speed projects, certainly, of 
course, California, which has been discussed here. The 
Brightline West vision, Dallas to Houston, those have all been 
on FRA's desk in some way or another. But of course we are 
still early in the life of the deployment of the Federal-State 
partnership dollars and other resources that could make a 
difference here. And I don't want to prejudice any upcoming 
applications.
    Mr. Moulton. Well, I understand, but we are not early in 
the administration's timeline here. These projects take some 
time and I just want to emphasize that if this is going to be 
President Biden's legacy, if President Biden is going to be 
known as the father of developing rail in the United States, 
not the old-fashioned rail that we have but high-speed rail 
that is truly the envy of the world and that a lot of Americans 
actually want to ride, then we have got to get cracking on 
identifying those corridors.
    Yesterday, dozens and dozens of flights were canceled on 
the Northeast Corridor, mine among them, because of a strange 
and unusual phenomenon called thunderstorms. The rest of the 
world would be able to get from Washington to Boston in 3 hours 
on a train every 20 minutes with never a delay for weather. Not 
only are we not there, but we're moving in the wrong direction. 
In 2010, Amtrak proposed reducing travel times in the Northeast 
Corridor to 1 hour and 36 minutes from Washington to New York 
and 1 hour and 24 minutes from New York to Boston, yet 7 years 
later in 2017 trip time goals went up from 1:36 to 2:10 and 
from 1:24 to 2:45, almost 3 hours. Just a year later they 
increased again to 2:29 and 3:08.
    So, we are not only behind China and the rest of the world, 
we're going in the wrong direction. I mean, at this rate, the 
goals Amtrak sets 10 years from now will be worse than how long 
it takes to travel that roller coaster ride on the Northeast 
Corridor today. So, to meet the President's promise of the 
fastest trains in the world, we need a transformative 
investment, not just repairing an old line that is too slow by 
definition by the way it was laid out in the 1830s but actually 
building a new railway the same way that we didn't just repair 
Route 1, we built 95.
    So, how will you make that happen with the discretionary 
funds in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act?
    Secretary Buttigieg. So, with the dollars that we have for 
the Northeast Corridor, first there is some needs that need to 
be met in terms of safety and reliability for the long run. But 
where you really begin to start gaining minutes comes in a 
couple of ways. One is improving certain areas where there is, 
just because of the condition of the track, a need to slow 
down, but the other to your point where you see the most 
possibility for gain is actual realignment. That obviously 
brings a lot of complexity with it, but to meet the more 
aggressive and ambitious goals, we need to take the dollars as 
far as they will go in that direction, and I know that is what 
Amtrak is working on right now.
    Mr. Moulton. Well, let's make sure that we don't throw good 
money after bad. I think that is the key point here. If we're 
going to fulfill the President's promise of the fastest trains 
in the world, then they're not going to run on an old-fashioned 
Northeast Corridor. We can't just spread funds out to every 
State in the Union. We have got to pick a couple of high-speed 
rail projects that will succeed and so that Americans can see 
the value of high-speed rail whether you live in California or 
the Northeast or in Texas or in the Southeast.
    The most popular high-speed rail corridor in the world is 
about the same distance as Atlanta to Chicago. Think about all 
the cities in between Chicago and Atlanta that you could serve 
with 250-mile-per-hour service. It would be transformative for 
this country. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
    Ms. Norton. The gentleman's time has expired.
    I recognize Ms. Malliotakis. You are recognized for 5 
minutes.
    Ms. Malliotakis. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here 
today. I want to talk about this administration and New York 
City's latest scheme when it comes to the war on cars. This is 
a pure cash grab, and it is the congestion pricing plan that 
was passed by the New York State Legislature and signed by our 
Governor and supported by the mayor. But I am certainly 
opposed, and I think that this is simply--to try to impose a 
$35 fee potentially to drive within your own city, it is just 
completely outrageous, and it adds to why New York is such a 
high tax State not only dealing with the high gas prices, the 
highest probably among--one of the highest in the Nation, but 
high tolls.
    We have the skyrocketing costs of used cars. Everything has 
gone up in terms if you want to be a driver, and people need to 
drive to get to where they have to go particularly in cash-
starved communities. In New York City, we also have speed 
cameras. You name it, we have it, if it is going to collect 
cash, unfortunately. But this is what I seem to believe is 
another cash grab by our city interstate.
    It is going to be the first in the Nation, and with that I 
understand that also the Federal Highway Administration has 
responsibility to oversee an environmental assessment or an 
environmental impact statement. I believe being that it is 
going to be the first in the Nation, we have the responsibility 
to do our due diligence, and we should be conducting an 
environmental impact statement versus a simple assessment. Can 
you please talk a little bit more about will you be requiring 
the MTA and New York City to be conducting a full and thorough 
EIS as well as it should be an economic impact study as well?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, our responsibility is to make 
sure that a project that comes forward with local sponsorship 
and interest like the congestion pricing project meets all 
Federal legal requirements, including under NEPA. I can't say 
here whether based on sitting here all of the things that go 
into the determination of whether it is the EA track or the 
full EIS. I can say that our Department will bring its best 
judgment to making sure that it goes through the appropriate 
process.
    And our role is to make sure that all of those Federal 
hurdles are responsively met but recognizing and respecting 
that ultimately this is a local policy choice.
    Ms. Malliotakis. Yes, but, first of all, there is 
bipartisan opposition among legislators and Members of Congress 
from the New York/New Jersey area as it will have a significant 
impact on our constituents who are already struggling to get by 
and make ends meet. Now, earlier this year, the MTA chief 
executive, Janno Lieber, said in an interview that the FHWA 
told him that they were going to fast track the environmental 
process. Can you make a commitment that you will require an 
environmental impact study, a full and thorough review being 
that this is a first in the Nation program that is--I don't 
want my constituents to be guinea pigs. We need to do this 
right.
    I believe that we shouldn't be doing it at all, but if 
you're going to do it, at least do the due diligence in making 
sure that we are dotting our i's, crossing our t's, and seeing 
what the actual impact will be on businesses, on the 
surrounding community, on the residents that live in the 
central district but also the other residents of the city from 
the outer boroughs that have to commute in.
    Secretary Buttigieg. I can commit to you that the review 
will be proper and thorough, no unnecessary delays but no cut 
corners either.
    Ms. Malliotakis. Will you do an environmental impact study, 
though, a complete study, not just an assessment? That is 
really the question.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Again, the legal determination about 
whether it falls into an EA or an EIS is not one that I want to 
make sitting here, but I can tell you that the review either 
way will be proper and thorough on our part.
    Ms. Malliotakis. Well, if it is going to be proper and 
thorough, then that would be the EIS. I think that anyone 
looking at this as an observer--but let's move on to the public 
comments. How are you going to make sure that the public knows 
that this process is fair, that it is transparent and is not 
coming at a predisposed arrival at a determination already?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, again, our role here is 
procedural. It has to do with making sure that the process has 
been met, not preempting a local decision about what the right 
policy is. I know there are strong views on all sides that cut 
across party lines and even across State and regional lines 
when it comes to this project in particular, but we recognize 
that the State and local role is distinct from the Federal 
role. Ours is to make sure there is transparency and 
thoroughness----
    Ms. Malliotakis [interrupting]. OK. Lastly, the Federal 
Highway Administration required MTA to answer 430 technical 
questions after they submitted their draft of the EA. These 
have not been made public or made available to Congress. Can 
you share those questions and answers that you received with 
the public?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I will look into the right process for 
getting those out.
    Ms. Malliotakis. All right. Well, if we believe in 
transparency, we want to make sure we get that information out 
to the public domain. So, I would appreciate your assistance 
with that. And my time has run out. Thank you.
    Ms. Norton. The gentlewoman's time has expired.
    I recognize Mr. Fitzpatrick. You are recognized for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Fitzpatrick. Thank you, Madam Chair. Secretary 
Buttigieg, thanks for being here. Good to see you. I want to 
start by thanking you for your collaboration on the bipartisan 
infrastructure bill. It was a lot of work, a lot of 
collaboration. You worked great with our office, and I wanted 
to thank you for your role. I think it is going to really help 
America.
    Two questions. One, I don't think it is a fair question 
because we just sent this letter last week, but I wanted to 
bring it to your attention, to you and FRA Administrator Bose, 
regarding the public nuisance and safety risk posed by blocked 
railroad crossings. Certainly I have had to deal with it in my 
district. I am sure I am not alone for sure. Lasting upwards of 
an hour, these instances keep communities like mine and others 
across the country cut off from commercial, Government and even 
more significantly, emergency services, ambulances, firetrucks, 
and what not.
    So, I am going to submit this to the record. We have sent 
it to you, but I know how agencies work, it might not have made 
its way to you. Just to give a general update, on the blocked 
crossing portal authorized by the IIJA section 22404 and to 
address mechanisms or formulas that could measure the real 
impact of obstructions of railroad crossings.
    Madam Chair, do I have permission to submit this for the 
record?
    Ms. Norton. Accepted.
    [The information follows:]

                                 
     Letter of July 13, 2022, to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of 
   Transportation, and Hon. Amit Bose, Administrator of the Federal 
  Railroad Administration, from Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick, Member of 
    Congress, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick

The Honorable Pete Buttigieg,
Secretary of Transportation,
U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, 
        Washington, DC 20590.
The Honorable Amit Bose,
Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration,
U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, 
        Washington, DC 20590.
    Dear Secretary Buttigieg and Administrator Bose,
    I write today regarding the implementation of the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), and specifically, the Blocked Crossing 
Portal authorized under Section 22404. When meeting with constituents, 
my staff and I are consistently asked about the public nuisance and 
safety risk posed by obstructed crossings.
    Our district has two frequently blocked rail crossings, at Bellevue 
Avenue in Langhorne, PA, and at Woodbourne Road in Middletown, PA. 
Lasting for upwards of an hour, these instances keep our communities 
cut off from commercial, public, and emergency services. Local reports 
have indicated that miles-long trains, malfunctioning lights and 
sensors, and lowered gates create disruptive and unnecessary vehicle 
traffic. Worst of all, these blocked crossings severely impact the 
ability of our communities' first responders to respond to emergencies 
or immediately reach hospitals and healthcare facilities.
    These colloquial accounts are compelling and given that the 
railroads are overseen by the Department of Transportation and the 
Federal Railroad Administration, this issue requires federal action. 
Enacting the Infrastructure and Jobs Act and particularly requiring the 
comprehensive collection of data through the Blocked Crossing Portal 
are important first steps to solving this problem.
    As you continue to implement this three-year public data gathering 
program, I ask that you review and provide a written response to the 
following questions.
    1.  Is the DOT or FRA encountering any difficulty or delay in 
implementing the Blocked Crossing Portal? If so, what actions need to 
be taken to expedite the effective administration of the program?
    2.  Can the DOT or FRA share any insights from, or even raw 
preliminary data collected by, the Blocked Crossing Portal that may 
help preemptively inform lawmakers?

    It is squarely the responsibility of the federal government, and 
especially the Department of Transportation and Federal Railroad 
Administration, to address and remediate the detrimental impact of 
blocked railroad crossings. I appreciate your timely review and 
response to this letter.
        Sincerely,
                                      Brian K. Fitzpatrick,
                                                Member of Congress.

    Mr. Fitzpatrick. So, my question, Mr. Secretary, I want to 
discuss secondary cockpit barriers. The 9/11 Commission did 
tremendous work many years ago. Most, if not all, of those 
recommendations were adopted by Congress and implemented as 
part of our commitment to say never again to allow a terrorist 
to infiltrate a cockpit and treat a commercial airliner like a 
guided missile.
    Even though this was included as a requirement for new 
aircraft in the last FAA reauthorization nearly 4 years ago, 
application of this mandate has been very slow and very 
inconsistent. I can tell you, myself and my Problem Solvers 
Caucus cochair have been working very hard, and we have had 
frustrating results across multiple administrations to be 
frank, and we are hoping that we can finally fix this.
    Since coming to Congress, we have advocated for this, both 
of us. On 9/11, my constituent, Captain Victor Saracini, he was 
the pilot of flight 175 that our whole world watched in horror 
crash into the second tower. And I was wondering, Mr. 
Secretary, how familiar you are with this, how much you are 
tracking it amongst a lot of the things you are dealing with, 
if you would be willing to work with us as well to get this 
done. This is a bipartisan issue. It is really incredible that 
decades after 9/11, the most basic safety precaution is not 
being implemented.
    It has been blocked for all the wrong reasons by special 
interests that don't want it for the wrong reasons. And all of 
us have flown. We have watched the exchange when the cockpit 
door opens for a pilot to go to the restroom, or what not, and 
all that is placed there under current policy is a food cart 
and an airline attendant. Twenty years after 9/11, it is really 
unacceptable, and it is such an easy fix. It is something that 
has already been approved and authorized on new aircraft. Will 
you be willing to work with us on getting that done and also 
getting retrofitted for current aircraft? And do you have any 
other comments on the issue?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you. Yes, I am following this 
policy. I know there is a great deal of impatience which I 
share about making sure that this is delivered especially 
knowing that it is called for in legislation. I have met with 
advocates as well as experts on this, and it is being taken 
very seriously. The FAA is working toward getting that 
rulemaking advanced. I certainly welcome a chance to work with 
you to make sure that some of the complexities are handled in 
the right way and that there is transparency around the 
timeline.
    Mr. Fitzpatrick. Thank you, sir. Just like all these tragic 
incidents whether they be school shootings or acts of 
terrorism, when we say never again it has got to be never 
again. That 9/11 Commission did tremendous work, and this is 
one of the few, possibly the only one, of the committee's 
recommendations that has not been implemented. And I fear that 
given how many years have passed since the last terror attack 
due to the credit of a lot of our national security agencies 
have avoided that, that we are still vulnerable because human 
instinct is to drop your guard when you have kept your guard up 
for so long.
    And I am fearful that this is an instance where we are 
exposed to a terror attack once again, and I hope that you are 
willing to work with us, which you say you are, and I 
appreciate that. But if you could just flag this for your 
people, I would appreciate it.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you.
    Mr. Fitzpatrick. Madam Chair, I yield back.
    Ms. Norton. The gentleman yields back.
    I recognize Mr. Stauber for 5 minutes. You are recognized, 
Mr. Stauber.
    Mr. Stauber. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Mr. Secretary, thanks for coming today. You are aware of 
transportation issues. Do you know what the most inland port in 
North America, correction, in the United States is?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I am guessing it is in Minnesota.
    Mr. Stauber. Do you know where?
    Secretary Buttigieg. The most inland measured from the 
coasts or from the Great Lakes?
    Mr. Stauber. The most inland port is the Port of Duluth-
Superior.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Duluth. Right.
    Mr. Stauber. And I am very proud to represent that; a lot 
of commodities and economic value come to and from. And I also 
appreciate your support for the Soo locks. That money has got 
to continue because that helps the Midwest.
    I just want to talk to you a little bit about the chip 
shortage. As you know, we want to reshore it, and I think that 
when you reshore it you also have to reshore the minerals. You 
are aware or maybe I am going to make you aware that the 
biggest copper and nickel find in North America is in 
northeastern Minnesota which we call the Iron Range. The Iron 
Range has mined the iron ore that makes 80 percent of America's 
steel. So, if we have Buy America provisions, we have to have 
the Iron Range full steam ahead. Would you agree with that?
    Secretary Buttigieg. I don't want to weigh in outside of my 
lane in terms of production, but I certainly agree that we need 
to make sure we are onshoring or nearshoring raw materials that 
are going into----
    Mr. Stauber [interrupting]. And we have to keep our iron 
industry front and center. That's just strategic national 
security. So, when we talk about the chips, do you know that a 
Ford F-150 gasoline has 300 chips and the EV has 3,000? When 
you take critical minerals offline, you allow foreign 
adversarial countries to mine that. And I am just going to give 
you an example. Cobalt. The vast majority of cobalt is mined in 
the Congo using child slave labor. I think you would agree we 
would rather mine those minerals in the United States under the 
best environmental and best labor standards. Would that be 
correct, Mr. Secretary?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Yes. If we have a choice on where to 
source any of these, we would certainly prefer that it be in 
the U.S.
    Mr. Stauber. Yes. Your administration just took 234,000 
acres of opportunity to mine critical minerals. And let me tell 
you about the Duluth complex. It has 95 percent of our nickel 
reserve, 88 percent of our cobalt, over one-third of our copper 
and other platinum group metals, and your administration won't 
even allow an EIS on a project-specific review.
    You were just talking about an EIS, and you know, Mr. 
Secretary, the EIS is the highest look from the Federal 
Government. They wouldn't even allow a project-specific review 
of an EIS on a mining project. So, when you want to transition 
and when we transition to electric vehicles, why don't we have 
an administration that supports mining in the United States? 
And by the way, there is a project labor agreement in that, all 
union labor from northern Minnesota, hundreds of jobs and 
secondary jobs.
    And so, I would submit to you that we need to mine in the 
United States so we hold the destiny in the palm of our own 
hands. And the administration doesn't seem to understand that, 
and I would ask you this, and I think I know the answer: You do 
not support slave labor; is that correct?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Of course.
    Mr. Stauber. OK. This administration doesn't understand. We 
can remove ourselves from child slave labor by mining in the 
United States and making sure allies get these critical 
minerals from countries like the United States. Amnesty 
International, nonpartisan, has said we have to stop allowing 
slave labor, child slave labor. And I will submit to you we are 
able, ready, and willing, Mr. Secretary, to mine these critical 
minerals. We have to have an administration that has the 
political will to do it, and it doesn't.
    In October of 2020, then-candidate Joe Biden said to the 
American people we are going to mine these minerals 
domestically. That was a breath of fresh air for northern 
Minnesota and the Iron Range. Now President Biden says we are 
going to source those minerals from foreign nations. That, Mr. 
Secretary, is unacceptable. That is what we talked about. We 
can onshore and use American labor with the best environmental 
standards and labor standards in the world.
    And I would ask you to go back to your administration, 
specifically the President of the United States, and allow us 
to mine these minerals here in the United States. And I yield 
back.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you.
    Ms. Norton. The gentlemen yields back.
    I recognize Mr. Van Drew. You are recognized for 5 minutes.
    Dr. Van Drew. [Audio drop.] Thanks again for being here. 
Now you can hear me. See, if you didn't say anything, we would 
have cut them a break. You could have missed the whole thing. 
In my district of South Jersey, the infrastructure law is 
aiding the United States Army Corps of Engineers with a major 
dredging project in New Jersey's Intracoastal Waterway. The 
project will clear out the clogged maritime channels of the 
entire Jersey Shore and make my community safer and more 
prosperous.
    The law has also provided funding for airports and roads 
and projects across my district. South Jersey has many 
infrastructure needs, but I will continue to advocate for this 
infrastructure law as it is implemented over the next 5 years. 
I supported this Bipartisan Infrastructure Law because it 
included conservative--conservative--regulatory policies 
negotiated by Republicans including One Federal Decision.
    One Federal Decision cuts through redtape by requiring 
interagency cooperation, limited paperwork, and fixed 
permitting deadlines. This policy saves years of time and 
millions of dollars in the permitting of infrastructure 
projects. With inflation ravaging, the country is in a critical 
situation that we need to reduce redtape so that the funding 
increases and the infrastructure law is not outpaced. That's 
why Republican negotiators included these conservative 
regulatory policies.
    My concern is that this administration is far more focused 
on spending money than on saving money, and that irresponsible 
mentality could hinder the implementation of the infrastructure 
law. One Federal Decision policy was put in place by President 
Trump in 2017 through Executive order. President Biden repealed 
it on his very first day in office. Thanks to the 
infrastructure bill, One Federal Decision is now law, and it 
must be implemented.
    So, first question, Mr. Secretary, do you fully commit--
fully commit--that you are proactively working to implement One 
Federal Decision in line with the letter of the law?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Yes, we are. Thank you, first of all, 
for your support for this legislation and want you to know that 
we take very seriously the One Federal Decision provisions. 
Some of those that we have been working on this regard include 
establishing schedules that are consistent with the 2-year 
average for most EISs, environmental impact statements, issuing 
necessary authorizations, all necessary authorizations within 
90 days of completing NEPA, setting up a performance 
accountability system to track progress toward our goals, and 
reporting to this committee regularly on the timelines of both 
the EISs and then the environmental assessments and categorical 
exclusions as well as working with other agencies on how to 
make sure that those categorical exclusions are as efficiently 
managed as possible.
    So, we will continue our work on this and through the 
permitting dashboard aim to be as transparent as possible about 
how we are actually tracking toward those goals.
    Dr. Van Drew. We would appreciate that, and it could make a 
huge difference. Thank you. Second question I have, and 
Congressman Stauber touched on it a little bit, concerned about 
the batteries. I am concerned about the environmental aspects 
of the batteries, and I am concerned about that so much of it 
is controlled by China. So much is controlled in the Congo. It 
is virtual slave labor.
    We say as Americans that we are humane, and we are human, 
and we care about life, yet we buy so many products from a 
country that absolutely has no concern about that at all. I 
don't understand how we do that. I don't understand how we buy 
products made by the Uyghurs. I don't understand how we are 
going to be buying products from the Congo, but the Chinese 
controls the Congo. And what scares me about that, Mr. 
Secretary, is they control too much already. They are getting 
stronger, and I am sorry to say it, we are getting weaker.
    And he may not have been one of your favorite Presidents, 
but he was one of my favorite Presidents, Ronald Reagan. He 
said there is no country that has ever been attacked because it 
is too strong. We have to get stronger. We have to produce our 
own goods and services. We have to produce our own cobalt if we 
are going to do this. We have to produce our own elements and 
minerals.
    And finally, we have to make sure if we make standards for 
ourselves internally that we keep those standards for everybody 
else. You know what is happening now? And you do know this. 
China is creating tons of fossil fuel. Russia is. India is. 
Other countries are. They are not following the Paris Accords 
in most of Europe. We are doing it and putting ourselves at a 
deficiency and diminishing ourselves and making ourselves 
weaker. That is unacceptable. That is not the America I know. 
It is not the America I believe in, and we have to stop it, Mr. 
Secretary.
    Thank you. I yield back.
    Ms. Norton. The gentleman's time has expired.
    That concludes our hearing. I would like to thank Secretary 
Buttigieg for your testimony today. Your comments have been 
very informative and helpful.
    I ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing 
remain open until such time that our witness has provided 
answers to any questions that may be submitted to him in 
writing.
    I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open 
for 15 days for additional comments and information submitted 
by Members or the witness to be included in the record of the 
day's hearing.
    Without objection, so ordered. The committee stands 
adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 3:07 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]

                              ----------                              


 Prepared Statement of Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Representative in 
                    Congress from the State of Texas
    Thank you, Chairman DeFazio, and Ranking Member Graves, for holding 
today's hearing on implementation of the IIJA. I would also like to 
thank the Secretary for testifying today.
    The City of Dallas, DFW Airport, Dallas Area Rapid Transit, the 
Dallas Inland Port, and Texas Trees Foundation have all applied for DOT 
grants this year that are being funded by the IIJA. This is just in 
North Central Texas, but we know DOT is getting thousands of requests 
for every grant they announce.
    With the $75 billion allocated this year to just highways, transit, 
and airports, this legislation is creating over 975,000 good-paying 
jobs and improving the transportation infrastructure in every state in 
America.
    It seems clear to me that the IIJA is already a success and has the 
potential to make monumental improvements to our nation's 
transportation system.
    I would just encourage the Secretary and the leadership at DOT to 
stay focused on ensuring that these funds are getting out to local 
communities as quickly as possible and are being used on projects that 
will have the biggest impact on improving the movement of both people 
and goods.
    I look forward to hearing from the Secretary how these IIJA funds 
are successfully being distributed and utilized, and what we can expect 
next from the Department of Transportation.

                                 
Letter of July 18, 2022, to Hon. Peter A. DeFazio, Chair, and Hon. Sam 
Graves, Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, 
from Catherine Chase, President, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, 
           Submitted for the Record by Hon. Peter A. DeFazio
                                                     July 18, 2022.
The Honorable Peter A. DeFazio, Chair,
The Honorable Sam Graves, Ranking Member,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
United States House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
    Dear Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves:
    Thank you for holding tomorrow's hearing, ``Implementing the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.'' We respectfully request this 
letter be included in the hearing record.
    The skyrocketing number of deaths and consistently high number of 
injuries on our nation's roads over the last several years has renewed 
national focus on the need for proven solutions to reduce these 
preventable tragedies. Hearing witness U.S. Department of 
Transportation (DOT) Secretary Pete Buttigieg has accurately stated, 
``This is a crisis.'' \1\ The safety advances included in the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and continued action on 
other Congressionally mandated safety countermeasures must be 
implemented by the U.S. DOT in a comprehensive and expeditious 
manner.\2\

 Motor Vehicle Crashes are a Major Public Health Problem Which Demands 
                            Immediate Action
    As this Committee is well aware, our nation's roads have become 
more dangerous and deadlier. According to the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration (NHTSA), 42,915 people were killed in motor 
vehicle crashes in 2021.\3\ This represents a 10.5 percent increase 
from 2020 and the highest number of deaths since 2005.\4\ In addition, 
fatalities across a number of categories rose from 2020 to 2021 
including speeding (five percent), alcohol-involved crashes (five 
percent) and unrestrained occupants of passenger vehicles (3 
percent).\5\ The NHTSA currently values each life lost in a crash at 
$11.8 million.\6\ The crashes, injuries and fatalities impose a 
financial burden of over $1 trillion in total costs to society--$313 
billion of which are direct economic costs.\7\ This is equivalent to a 
``crash tax'' of $944 on every person living in the U.S.\8\ In 2019, 
crashes alone cost employers $72.2 billion.\9\

has increased by 66 percent.\11\ Additionally, nearly 147,000 people 
were injured in crashes involving a large truck in 2020.\12\ The cost 
to society from crashes involving large trucks and buses was estimated 
to be $163 billion in 2019, the latest year for which data is

    As the IIJA is Implemented, It Should be a ``Floor'' and not a 
  ``Ceiling'' for what Must be Achieved to Address the Motor Vehicle 
                      Crash Death and Injury Toll
    Every major surface transportation bill passed by Congress over the 
last three decades has included significant traffic safety 
improvements. These innovations have garnered bipartisan support and 
saved thousands of lives. Advocates commends this Committee for 
championing commonsense safety solutions, many of which were included, 
in some fashion, in the IIJA enacted last November.\16\ These 
provisions include:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \16\ Pub. L. 117-58 (2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Section 11111: Authorizes safety upgrades to the Highway 
Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) that will help to protect vulnerable 
road users (VRUs).
      Section 11119: Directs U.S. DOT to establish a Safe 
Routes to School Program.
      Section 11135: Mandates that initial update of the Manual 
on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD) 
includes protection of VRUs.
      Section 11206: Requires states and local entities to 
spend a minimum amount of funding for complete streets standards and 
policies.
      Section 11504: Requires U.S. DOT to conduct a study on 
the existing and future impacts of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to 
transportation infrastructure, mobility, the environment, and safety.
      Section 23008: Mandates U.S. DOT further consider a rule 
requiring state inspection of passenger carrying commercial motor 
vehicles (CMVs).
      Section 24102: Permits the use of federal funding for 
automated enforcement in school and work zones.
      Section 24107: Requires states to have minimum penalties 
for repeat multi-substance offenders to avoid diversion of federal 
highway construction funds.

    Additionally, Section 23010 of the IIJA requires automatic 
emergency braking (AEB) on large CMVs weighing over 26,000 pounds. 
However, it fails to mandate these systems on Class 3-6 trucks which 
are ubiquitous in many neighborhoods with the rise of delivery services 
and e-commerce. In addition, the provision fails to direct that the AEB 
system will detect and respond to VRUs such as pedestrians and 
bicyclists. Advocates and others including the National Transportation 
Safety Board (NTSB) have been strongly urging the U.S. DOT to address 
these issues as part of the rulemaking process, as it has the authority 
to do so.
    This Committee should also be lauded for directing U.S. DOT in 
Section 23011 of the IIJA to finally complete a long overdue rulemaking 
updating the performance standards for truck trailer underride guards. 
This critical safety equipment can prevent a passenger vehicle from 
traveling underneath a trailer during a crash. Unfortunately, the rule 
released by NHTSA this month fails to meet the requirements included in 
the IIJA despite the fact that nine of the largest trailer 
manufacturers in the U.S. already meet the requirements in the 
legislation.\17\

used to identify unsafe motor carriers under Compliance, Safety,

upon revision of the methodology.
      Section 4203: Mandated that U.S. DOT establish terms and

Devices (ELDs) to be used by U.S. DOT for transportation research.
      Section 4401: Required new school buses to be equipped 
with AEB and electronic stability control (ESC) systems.

    We urge the Committee to advance these issues at the earliest 
opportunity.
 Safety Setbacks in the IIJA Require Oversight and Mitigation of Damage
``Teen Truckers'' Pose a Major Safety Threat
    Section 23022 of the IIJA established a three-year pilot program to 
permit drivers ages 18-20 to operate CMVs in interstate commerce. Some 
segments of the trucking industry have been pushing to allow teenagers 
to operate CMVs in interstate commerce for at least 20 years, and 
safety organizations, among others, have been opposing this proposal at 
every step.
    The trucking industry is facing a driver retention crisis, not a 
driver shortage. In fact, a March 2019 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS) analysis found that ``the labor market for truck drivers works 
about as well as the labor markets for other blue-collar occupations'' 
and ``a deeper look [at the truck industry labor market] does not find 
evidence of a secular shortage.'' \19\ As Secretary Buttigieg recently 
noted, such a high rate of turnover is indicative that there are some 
real issues with the quality of the job of driving a truck.\20\ In 
addition, states issue more than 450,000 new commercial driver licenses 
(CDLs) each year demonstrating that there are candidates to fill 
vacancies.\21\

    Younger drivers are demonstrated to be less safe. Relatedly, as 
Secretary Buttigieg noted in discussing raising the mandatory 
retirement age for airline pilots, proposals regarding individuals in 
safety sensitive positions that ``jeopardize safety'' should be 
rejected.\22\ The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), citing 
numerous studies, has stated that ``age is a strong risk factor for 
truck crash involvement.'' \23\ In fact, age is the most important 
factor in the high rate of involvement of younger CMV drivers in fatal 
crashes. The general pattern of over-involvement in fatal crashes for 
younger CMV drivers dominates all other factors. Studies of young CMV 
drivers show that as the age of the driver decreases, large truck fatal 
crash involvement rates increase.\24\ CMV drivers under the age of 19 
are four times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes, as compared 
to CMV drivers who are 21 years of age and older, and CMV drivers ages 
19-20 are six times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes 
(compared to CMV drivers 21 years and older).\25\ Because of the 
significant public safety concerns associated with teen truck drivers, 
we urge this Committee to exercise vigilant oversight of U.S. DOT's 
implementation of the pilot program established in the IIJA. Moreover, 
we continue to urge the Committee to reject efforts to advance the 
misnamed ``DRIVE Safe'' Act (H.R. 1745/S. 659) which would establish a 
similar pilot program permitting teen truckers to operate in interstate 
commerce.

Fatigue is a Well-Known and Well-Documented Lethal Threat to the Safety 
        of CMV Drivers and the Public
    Studies consistently show that long working hours per day and per 
week are related to adverse health effects.\26\ The National Academies 
of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) has concluded that ``the 
cumulative long-term effects of sleep loss and sleep disorders have 
been associated with a wide range of deleterious health consequences 
including an increased risk of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, 
depression, heart attack, and stroke.'' \27\ Moreover, the American 
Academy of Sleep Medicine warns that drowsy driving can have the same 
consequences as driving while under the influence of drugs and 
alcohol.\28\ Despite the NTSB repeatedly citing fatigue as a major 
contributor to truck crashes, Section 23018 of IIJA included a 
provision further weakening the HOS rules to the detriment of public 
safety.\29\ We urge Congress to reject further attempts to degrade HOS 
rules, including weakening or exempting the requirement for ELDs which 
have been demonstrated to be effective at ensuring compliance.

    In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Motor Carrier 
Safety Administration (FMCSA) has provided exemptions from certain 
federal regulations including HOS rules for motor carriers and drivers. 
Any exemption from federal regulations must be narrowly tailored in 
time and scope with appropriate safeguards to protect truck drivers and 
the public. Additionally, Congress must not enshrine temporary 
exemptions into statute, and there must be transparency about their use 
by making any related data available to the public.
Overweight Trucks Disproportionately Damage America's Crumbling 
        Infrastructure and Threaten Public Safety
    According to the 2021 Infrastructure Report Card from the American 
Society of Civil Engineers, America's roads receive a grade of ``D,'' 
and our bridges were given a ``C.'' \30\ Nearly 40 percent of our 
615,000 bridges in the National Bridge Inventory are 50 years or older, 
and one out of 11 is structurally deficient.\31\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unfortunately, Section 11515 in the IIJA included exemptions to 
federal truck size and weight limits. Raising truck weight or size 
limits could result in an increased prevalence and severity of crashes. 
Unsurprisingly, trucks heavier than 80,000 pounds have a greater number 
of brake violations, which are a major reason for out-of-service 
violations.\32\ According to a North Carolina study by IIHS, trucks 
with out-of-service violations are 362 percent more likely to be 
involved in a crash.\33\ This is also troubling considering that 
tractor-trailers moving at 60 miles per hour are required to stop in 
310 feet--the length of a football field--once the brakes are 
applied.\34\ Actual stopping distances are often much longer due to 
driver response time before braking and the common problem that truck 
brakes are often not in adequate working condition.

    There is overwhelming opposition to any increases to truck size and 
weight limits. The public, local government officials, safety, consumer 
and public health groups, law enforcement, first responders, truck 
drivers and labor representatives, families of truck crash victims and 
survivors, and Congress on a bipartisan level have all rejected 
attempts to increase truck size and weight limits. Also, the technical 
reports released in June 2015 from the U.S. DOT Comprehensive Truck 
Size and Weight Study concluded there is a ``profound'' lack of data 
from which to quantify the safety impact of larger or heavier trucks 
and consequently recommended that no changes in the relevant truck size 
and weight laws and regulations be considered until data limitations 
are overcome.\35\

    Although IIJA invested billions of dollars to improve and make our 
nation's roads and bridges safer, it also included exemptions to 
federal truck size and weight laws.\36\ Any further weakening of these 
critical safety regulations will undermine this objective, worsen 
safety problems and divert rail traffic from privately owned freight 
railroads, which are safer than public roadways, to our already 
overburdened highways exacerbating road wear, congestion and safety 
issues.

      Experimental Autonomous Driving Technology Remains Unproven
    Several serious crashes involving cars equipped with autonomous 
driving technology, which is unregulated, have already occurred. Many 
have been subject to investigation by the NTSB and NHTSA which have and 
will continue to identify safety deficiencies, determine contributing 
causes, and recommend government and industry actions to prevent future 
deadly incidents.
    In June 2021, NHTSA issued Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO) 
requiring manufacturers to report certain crashes involving vehicles 
equipped with automated driving systems (ADS) or Level 2 advanced 
driver assistance systems (ADAS). Last month, NHTSA released the first 
set of data obtained through the SGO and the information is deeply 
troubling.\37\ The data showed that of the 108 entities sent the SGO, 
only 12 reported on ADAS, revealing nearly 400 crashes. Six crashes 
were fatal, five resulted in serious injuries, and another 41 resulted 
in minor or moderate injuries. Four involved a VRU such as a bicyclist 
or a pedestrian. Twenty-five entities reported on ADS, revealing 130 
crashes. Sixteen crashes reportedly resulted in injuries. Eleven 
crashes involved a VRU including seven cyclists. Additionally, recent 
testing mishaps with vehicles equipped with ADS include a fleet of test 
taxis stopping in the middle of street and requiring human intervention 
to move the ``cluster'' and a test vehicle operating without its 
headlights while failing to follow police instructions.\38\ Our 
nation's roads should not be an unregulated beta testing ground for 
this experimental technology, threatening the safety of the traveling 
public.

    In January, Advocates released the results of a new public opinion 
poll that showed 80 percent of respondents are concerned about sharing 
the road with driverless cars as a motorist, bicyclist or a pedestrian. 
Eighty-five (85) percent of respondents are similarly concerned about 
sharing the road with driverless tractor-trailers and delivery trucks. 
Of note, 60 percent of respondents feel that if the companies had to 
meet minimum government safety requirements for their driverless cars 
and trucks, it would address their concerns.
    We once again commend this Committee and the Subcommittee on 
Highways and Transit for holding the February hearing, ``The Road Ahead 
for Automated Vehicles.'' Many promises have been touted about 
autonomous vehicles (AVs) bringing reductions in motor vehicle crashes 
and resultant deaths and injuries, lowering traffic congestion and 
vehicle emissions, expanding mobility and accessibility, improving 
efficiency, and creating more equitable transportation options and 
opportunities. However, as Secretary Buttigieg has acknowledged, these 
outcomes are far from certain.\39\ Similarly, an article published in 
The Washington Post by David Zipper in February entitled, ``Companies 
are racing to make self-driving cars. But why?'' examined this further 
and called into question many of the oft-touted benefits AV proponents 
have claimed.\40\ Zipper notes Secretary Buttigieg has said ``that 
self-driving cars have `raised complicated, even philosophical, 
questions about safety, equity and our workforce.' '' Zipper adds, 
``With so much at stake in the future of self-driving cars, government 
officials should be keeping a watchful eye on new developments, ready 
to intervene to defend the public interest.''

    Advocates has consistently sought action by the U.S. DOT to ensure 
the safety of the public driving, riding, walking and rolling on our 
roads and in contact with the still developing technology. In 2020, 
Advocates spearheaded the compilation of the ``AV Tenets,'' policy 
positions which should be a foundational part of any AV policy. This 
comprehensive approach is based on expert analysis, real world 
experience and public opinion. It is supported by 60 stakeholders 
representing safety, consumer, public health, labor, bicyclists, 
pedestrians, individuals with disabilities, smart growth, and 
others.\41\ It has four main, commonsense categories including: 1) 
prioritizing safety of all road users; 2) guaranteeing accessibility 
and equity for all individuals including those with disabilities; 3) 
preserving consumer and worker rights; and, 4) ensuring local control 
and sustainable transportation. We urge Congress to use this document 
as a foundation for any future AV legislation.

    We laud the Committee for holding this hearing to make certain that 
the U.S. DOT meets its mission to ensure the safest transportation 
system in the world. Oversight of implementation of the IIJA is a 
critical component to this end. We look forward to continuing to work 
with you to improve safety on our nation's roadways.

Statement of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Submitted for the 
                    Record by Hon. Peter A. DeFazio
                              Introduction
    The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) appreciates the 
opportunity to submit a statement to the House Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure for the hearing on Implementing the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
    ASCE was a strong supporter of the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act (IIJA) of 2021. Successful implementation of this once-in-a-
generation investment has the potential to improve safety for Americans 
and modernize the nation's roads, bridges, transit systems, pipes, 
ports, broadband, airports, schools, and drinking water systems.
        Recommendations for Effective Implementation of the IIJA
    With the $1.2 trillion investment provided by the IIJA, the federal 
government can restore its critical partnership with cities and states 
to improve our nation's infrastructure. To optimize the investment of 
over 100 new programs and many more existing programs across critical 
infrastructure sectors, ASCE has developed key recommendations for 
Congress, the Administration, and state and local governments to 
consider as implementation of the IIJA gets underway.
1. Require the Use of the Most Up-to-Date Codes and Standards and 
        Regularly Fund Climate Data Updates
    The most reliable way to ensure our nation's infrastructure is 
resilient and that we are truly building back better, is the widespread 
adoption and enforcement of modern, up-to-date building codes. 
Therefore, ASCE strongly encourages federal agencies to incentivize the 
use of up-to-date codes and standards, which can mitigate risks of 
climate or manmade events such as hurricanes, fires, sea level rise, 
and more.
    Additionally, while ASCE urges new federal programs to incentivize 
the use of up-to-date codes and standards, ASCE also supports the 
development, adoption, and enforcement of a national model code as a 
key method of minimizing climate impact and creating disaster 
resilience in communities. Programs like the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency's (FEMA) Building Resilient Infrastructure and 
Communities (BRIC) grant program are already requiring the use of up-
to-date codes and standards and can serve as a model for other programs 
across the federal government. For example, the Department of Energy 
should require that any new projects dedicated to modernizing and 
hardening the electric grid follow ASCE 74, Guidelines for Electrical 
Transmission Line Structural Loading.
    The following ASCE documents and standards should also be utilized 
for new projects that are receiving IIJA funds. These same documents 
serve as a basis upon which such a model code can be developed:
      ASCE 7, Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for 
Buildings and Other Structures (ASCE/SEI 7-22), currently an integral 
part of U.S. building codes, describes the means for determining soil, 
flood, tsunami, snow, rain, atmospheric ice, earthquake, and wind 
loads, and their combinations for resilient structural design;
      ASCE 24, Flood Resistant Design and Construction, 
prescribes a standard for cost effectively increasing resiliency by 
reducing and eliminating risks to property from flood hazards and their 
effects;
      ASCE 41, Seismic Evaluation and Retrofit of Existing 
Buildings, standardizes methods for the retrofit of existing buildings 
to increase resiliency in communities after a seismic event;
      ASCE Manual of Practice 140, Climate-Resilient 
Infrastructure: Adaptive Design and Risk Management, provides guidance 
for and contributes to infrastructure analysis/design in a world in 
which risk profiles are changing due to climate change per the Fourth 
National Climate Assessment.
      ASCE Manual of Practice 74, Guidelines for Electrical 
Transmission Line Structural Loading, provides guidelines for the 
interpretation of ASCE 7 specifically for overhead power lines and 
includes updated wind and ice loadings that all overhead transmission 
and distribution lines should be designed for with the consideration of 
current climate change data.
      ASCE Manual of Practice 141, Wood Pole Structures for 
Electrical Transmission Lines: Recommended Practice for Design and Use, 
provides guidelines for the proper design and analysis of wood pole 
structures used in our distribution and transmission grid 
infrastructure.

    In the wake of Hurricane Harvey, the City of Houston voted to 
require all new construction in the city's floodplains be built two 
feet above the 500-year floodplain. Florida, meanwhile, has made a 
series of updates to their building codes over the past twenty years, 
including the mandated use of stronger nails, relocation of vents, and 
more thorough inspection processes. These are strong examples of how 
codes can be modernized and ASCE standards can be incorporated to 
strengthen a city or state's resilience.
    Therefore, while many state and local government agencies are 
leading the way, to fully realize the benefits of the IIJA, ASCE 
encourages federal agencies and Congress to support and incentivize the 
widespread adoption and enforcement of up-to-date building and 
infrastructure codes. The recent creation of the National Initiative to 
Advance Building Codes, which will focus on helping state and local 
governments adopt the most up-to-date building codes and standards, 
indicates that federal officials understand the importance of these 
codes and standards for resilience. ASCE stands ready to support the 
work of the initiative. Additionally, we urge Congress to provide 
robust funding to federal agencies like the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), FEMA, and the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST), whose missions include both developing 
the data necessary for ensuring standards can address the impacts of 
climate change and preparing and implementing a national model code 
that considers increasingly strong storms.
    Currently, the only data set that receives reliable federal funding 
to update is seismic data through the National Earthquake Hazards 
Reduction Program (NEHRP) authorization. FEMA and NOAA do not receive 
regular funding to update flood and rain data, so even with storms 
becoming stronger, in many cases the latest available rainfall data is 
decades old. This means, for example, that our nation's dams and levees 
are often being designed based on rainfall data from the 1970s, while 
buildings are being designed without the latest seismic and wind data 
that is necessary to build resiliently. While some states have taken it 
upon themselves to update data sets, such as rainfall data, this has 
led to a piecemeal approach and fails to recognize that floodplains and 
other hazards do not end at state lines, putting at risk communities 
across the country. We cannot build resiliently relying on backward-
looking data and, therefore, strongly urge Congress to fund these 
critical programs.
2. Dedicate Resources to Grow the Pipeline of Skilled Workers
    To realize the potential of this five-year legislation, it is 
critical that we have the civil engineering workforce in place to 
design, build, and maintain the nation's infrastructure. The American 
Council of Engineering Companies found that the industry will need to 
add 82,000 full- and part-time engineers to implement the IIJA. 
Infrastructure owners, including state and local departments of 
transportation and water utilities, as well as consulting engineers, 
cannot effectively utilize the influx of funding if they do not have 
the workforce in place.
    Congress continues to recognize workforce needs with recent 
provisions dedicated to advancing science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics (STEM) education in the House and Senate America Creating 
Opportunities for Manufacturing, Pre-Eminence in Technology, and 
Economic Strength (COMPETES) bills. However, Congress and the 
Administration must continue to encourage state and local governments 
to include skilled workers in their long-term workforce development 
plans. The Department of Labor and the National Science Foundation 
should partner with the engineering community to develop programs that 
can assist state STEM education and workforce plans to solve this 
ongoing challenge in the industry.
    Some limited funds in the bill support workforce development 
activities and address gaps, but we must continue to grow a diverse 
pipeline of skilled workers. Specifically, we must bring students into 
the industry and keep engineers in the United States. Even more 
importantly, funds can and should be directed to include targeted 
outreach to disadvantaged and minority communities in order to address 
the ongoing gender, racial, and ethnic diversity gap that persists in 
the engineering field.
3. Cut Red Tape and Increase Transparency Across Government Agencies
    ASCE has identified areas where the federal government should work 
with industry stakeholders to ensure projects are not delayed due to 
overly burdensome and often redundant red tape. First, while ASCE 
supports the intention of the Buy America language in the IIJA, we need 
to ensure that language does not hamper innovation, cause unnecessary 
project delays and cost increases, or further constrain markets. While 
guidance from the Administration related to Buy America is helpful, 
there is still concern that the waiver process will be overly 
burdensome and significantly slow down projects that require a waiver 
to be filed.
    Second, ASCE is encouraged by the IIJA codifying One Federal 
Decision, which will lead to cost reductions, and applauds the 
Administration for developing a Permitting Action Plan to further 
accelerate the federal permitting and environmental review process. One 
of the key recommendations in the 2021 Report Card for America's 
Infrastructure was to streamline the project permitting process across 
infrastructure sectors, while ensuring appropriate safeguards and 
protections are in place. Therefore, ASCE believes that the most recent 
plan is a step in the right direction to ensure that projects can be 
delivered on time, and on budget, while maintaining the rigorous 
environmental review process.
    Finally, the federal government has a responsibility to ensure that 
IIJA funds are properly managed. The historic scope of the IIJA and the 
large number of partners needed to deliver the legislation, such as 
state and local governments, contractors, consultants, non-profits, and 
even the public, means the federal government will face a complex 
challenge to reduce the risk of waste, fraud, and abuse. Therefore, 
transparency will be key, especially in areas like the grant selection 
process. To minimize risk and increase transparency ASCE recommends 
five actions:
      Develop and implement a comprehensive IIJA Financial Risk 
Plan;
      Ensure the U.S. Strategy on Countering Corruption is 
effectively implemented and resourced;
      Clearly define risk responsibilities of all partners 
responsible for delivering the IIJA
      Establish financial performance measures and monitor 
those measures throughout implementation;
      Utilize proven, effective tools such as ISO 37001 Anti-
Bribery Management Systems.
4. Fund Research and Development to Accelerate Innovation
    Comprehensive legislation focused on the nation's commitment to 
research and development (R&D) is a critical complement to the IIJA. 
Coupling the IIJA with R&D legislation like the America COMPETES Act 
will support the development of new and innovative materials and 
processes, cut project costs, and facilitate a durable, secure, 
sustainable, and resilient infrastructure network. ASCE urges Congress 
to further fund critical R&D programs at NIST, the National Science 
Foundation (NSF), the Department of Transportation, and the Department 
of Energy and urges those agencies to prioritize R&D investments that 
will make our infrastructure more resilient and equitable for 
communities in the future.
5. Collaborate with the Engineering Community to Develop Technical 
        Assistance for Disadvantaged and Rural Communities
    The IIJA took great strides to acknowledge the inequities that were 
created or exacerbated by our nation's built environment. Programs like 
the new Reconnecting Communities Pilot Program at the Department of 
Transportation, investments in Superfund and brownfields remediation, 
and set-aside funds for rural and disadvantaged communities throughout 
many of the water and broadband infrastructure programs will be 
critical to both begin to address past inequities and ensure that new 
investments are not perpetuating existing problems. Combined with the 
Administration's commitment to Justice40, which seeks to deliver 40% of 
overall benefits from relevant investments to disadvantaged 
communities, new funding has an opportunity to bring about change in 
many of these communities.
    To meet this mission, the federal government will need to partner 
with state and local governments and the engineering community to not 
just identify these disadvantaged communities but ensure that they have 
the tools necessary to compete for new funding.
    Additionally, ASCE and the engineering community stand ready to 
work with federal agencies to help expand upon the technical assistance 
programs that many rural and disadvantaged communities will rely upon 
to receive competitive grants. Agencies should coordinate with the 
nation's engineers to help identify those communities that need 
assistance and determine what type of assistance is needed, whether it 
is grant preparation, identifying suitable projects that will bring 
community benefits, or long-term capacity building within agencies or 
jurisdictions.
6. Incentivize Asset Management and Life Cycle Cost Analysis
    As new competitive grant programs are developed across federal 
agencies, these programs should provide incentives for asset management 
and life cycle cost analysis as a routine part of the planning process. 
There are a growing number of state and local governments and private 
sector infrastructure owners demonstrating the long-term advantages of 
employing comprehensive asset management practices. However, asset 
management plans are not required or incentivized by the federal 
government in many sectors, including wastewater. By encouraging the 
development and regular update of asset management plans and life cycle 
cost analysis as a condition to receive new federal funding, we can 
ensure programming and planning for operations and maintenance are part 
of every new infrastructure project. Furthermore, by providing 
prioritization for those agencies already using asset management 
practices, the federal government can ensure additional state and local 
agencies develop asset management plans and implement life cycle cost 
analysis.
    ASCE has identified several programs in the IIJA that are taking a 
step in the right direction by expanding the requirement for asset 
management plans as a condition to receive federal funding. One such 
example is the Federal-State Partnership for State of Good Repair Grant 
Program, which requires any public transit entity that owns 
infrastructure used for intercity passenger rail on the Northeast 
Corridor to develop an asset management system that can inform Amtrak's 
capital improvement program. Additionally, there is some funding 
available for small public water systems looking to create asset 
management plans. However, there are many additional programs that do 
not include that requirement and should. ASCE recommends federal 
agencies assess each new and existing IIJA program to determine whether 
requiring an asset management plan is feasible and would provide value 
for stakeholders. Additionally, ASCE encourages infrastructure owners 
that already have asset management plans to regularly update them so 
that these tools remain useful for decision-making.
    There are examples of state and local agencies and programs already 
making good use of asset management best practices. Those programs that 
are most successful provide clear guidelines and requirements and 
include a rigorous quality review, such as Michigan's Stormwater, Asset 
Management, and Wastewater Program. Since 2013, the Michigan program 
has helped municipalities develop, update, and improve asset management 
plans for their wastewater and stormwater systems, which has led to 
better services, more accurate project prioritization, and a more 
informed understanding of the current and future needs.
7. Prioritize Projects Dedicated to Maintaining and Improving Existing 
        Assets
    ASCE urges federal, state, and local governments to prioritize 
projects that will maintain, upgrade, and improve our existing assets.
    ASCE's 2021 Report Card for America's Infrastructure found that the 
nation's overall infrastructure grade is a ``C-'' and that it will cost 
an additional $2.5 trillion over the next decade to bring all of our 
infrastructure into a state of good repair. The IIJA represents a down 
payment that can help bridge the growing infrastructure investment gap, 
but funds must be spent wisely.
    Fortunately, many programs in the IIJA are already dedicated to 
improving existing assets, such as the Bridge Replacement, 
Rehabilitation, Preservation, Protection, and Construction Program, 
which will provide nearly $27 billion to states to fix approximately 
15,000 bridges most in need of repair across the country. This program 
will be critical to ensuring that the overall number of poor bridges in 
this country does not continue to rise as those bridges age in place. 
Additionally, the IIJA includes $15 billion to replace lead service 
line connections to customers, a critical investment to ensuring that 
our existing water systems are protecting public safety.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deferred maintenance has been an issue across the infrastructure sectors
 for decades. The 2021 Report Card for America's Infrastructure found
 that:
 There is a broken water main every two minutes, and an
 estimated 6 billion gallons of treated water lost each day in the U.S.
 That's enough to fill over 9,000 swimming pools.
 Growing deferred maintenance on our nation's roads has left 43%
 of our public roadways in poor or mediocre condition.
 In 2020, 7.5% of our nation's bridges were considered
 structurally deficient, meaning they were in ``poor'' condition.
 
The opportunity afforded by the IIJA will allow agencies to address
 pressing maintenance needs in the near future, thereby staving off
 worsening conditions and keeping communities safe.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ASCE recommends that additional programs created under the IIJA 
also allocate funding with a lens that examines how we can improve our 
existing assets, while understanding that some programs, such as those 
dedicated to grid modernization and port development, will need to 
build additional capacity. Some of these programs that should fix and 
modernize existing infrastructure include the Rebuilding American 
Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grant program, 
the Bridge Replacement, Rehabilitation, Preservation, Protection, and 
Construction Program, and the Federal-State Partnership for State of 
Good Repair Grant Program.
8. Streamline the Engineering Contracting Process
    In recent years, many projects around the country have been slowed 
down due to increased change orders during the contracting process. The 
Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee (EJCDC), a joint venture 
of ASCE, the National Society of Professional Engineers, and the 
American Council of Engineering Companies, publishes documents related 
to engineering, construction, design/build, construction manager as 
advisor, construction manager at risk, and procurement. The use of the 
EJCDC documents reduces potential errors, redundancies, or conflicts in 
construction contracts. EJCDC updates its documents approximately every 
five years to reflect industry trends, court decisions, and changes in 
applicable laws and regulations. The EJCDC has developed contracts for 
scoping, preliminary design, final design, construction, and 
commissioning. Therefore, the EJCDC has contracts that are ready to 
expeditiously move projects through the process when utilized 
appropriately.
    ASCE emphasizes that EJCDC construction contract forms that will 
effectively deliver projects under a variety of project delivery 
methods funded under the IIJA are available. Even more importantly, 
ASCE urges federal and state agencies to accept the current versions of 
the documents without exception. Additionally, it is necessary to 
ensure that smaller, rural, or disadvantaged communities are aware of 
these contract forms and have access to them.
    Therefore, ASCE recommends that all federal agencies follow the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Utilities Service (RUS) 
model, which has preapproved certain standard EJCDC engineering and 
construction series documents for use in projects funded under the RUS 
Water and Waste Disposal program. By preapproving EJCDC documents, the 
USDA has eliminated the need for applicants to purchase the separate 
Funding Agency edition of the documents and therefore has streamlined 
the process and made these documents more accessible for rural or 
disadvantaged communities. Local agencies are also relieved of the 
burden of drafting and editing documents for later approval by federal 
and state agencies.
    Furthermore, ASCE supports qualifications-based selection 
procedures outlined by the Brooks Architect-Engineers Act, the numerous 
similar state and local laws, and the American Bar Association's Model 
Procurement Code for State and Local Governments for engagement of 
engineering services. As the IIJA is implemented, ASCE strongly 
recommends that the application of the Brooks Act is upheld.
                               Conclusion
    In closing, ASCE remains dedicated to ensuring the IIJA is 
implemented efficiently and effectively. The nation is on the precipice 
of a long-awaited infrastructure decade; however, if we fail to make 
smart investments, create unnecessary project delays, build to outdated 
standards, or fail to fill the nation's workforce gaps, we will not 
realize the full impact of the historic investments made by the 
bipartisan infrastructure law.
    ASCE thanks the House Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure for holding this hearing. The nation's engineers stand 
ready to maintain, modernize, and build the infrastructure required for 
the next generation and are prepared to work with federal, state, and 
local officials to make sure these investments are spent wisely.



                                Appendix

                              ----------                              


Questions from Hon. Peter A. DeFazio to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary 
          of Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. Mr. Secretary, the IIJA authorized programs like ARPA-I 
and SMART grants to ensure continued focus on technological innovation 
in our transportation sector. How does DOT intend to leverage these and 
other programs to advance transportation sector innovations and scale 
already-validated technologies to promote further economic growth, 
innovation, and competition?
    Answer. The Strengthening Mobility and Revolutionizing 
Transportation (SMART) grant program is among many programs at the 
Department of Transportation (DOT) that will be used to demonstrate and 
scale technologies to address core transportation priorities. This 
program is structured to accelerate the impacts that emerging and 
proven technologies can have when integrated into transportation 
systems. In mid-September, DOT announced a NOFO for $100 million under 
the SMART grant program to support an initial set of projects.
    The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Infrastructure (ARPA-I) is 
authorized to be an advanced Research and Development (R&D) agency that 
will catalyze the development of innovative new technologies, systems, 
and capabilities designed to transform our nation's physical 
infrastructure (including resilience to cyber threats) and to ensure 
American technological leadership. ARPA-I aims to build the future of 
transportation that is safe, secure, efficient, resilient, while 
reducing the lifecycle impacts of and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
from transportation infrastructure and increasing equity and access for 
all. If appropriated, ARPA-I will focus primarily on the development of 
new and emerging technologies capable of commercialization and 
deployment at scale to solve persistent problems in transportation 
infrastructure. ARPA-I will foster highly innovative infrastructure R&D 
processes and contribute to transforming DOT's future in driving and 
supporting key innovations in transportation to maintain U.S. 
leadership.

    Question 2. Mr. Secretary, what role has the private sector played, 
and can continue to play, in the buildout of EV charging stations? Have 
you found interest among private businesses in hosting EV charging 
stations, are there impediments to their participation, and how can the 
Department help mitigate those obstacles as it begins distributing 
money under the NEVI grant program?
    Answer. The private sector has a vital role in the development of 
EV charging infrastructure, and we now have a once-in-a-generation 
opportunity to join them in establishing a convenient, reliable, 
affordable, and equitable national EV charging network. DOT encourages 
states to develop programs with cost-share requirements or rebates to 
leverage private investment in EV charging and maximize the impact of 
National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program 
funding. States were encouraged to involve relevant private sector and 
industry representatives throughout the development and deployment of 
their NEVI State EV Infrastructure Deployment Plans to allow for the 
identification of EV charging market opportunities and challenges, 
along with potential solutions to address them. As is discussed in the 
NEVI Formula program guidance, funds made available under the program 
may be used to contract with a private entity for acquisition, 
installation, and operation and maintenance of publicly accessible EV 
charging infrastructure (FHWA anticipates that this will be done in 
most cases), and the private entity may pay the non-federal share of 
the cost of a project.

    Question 3. Mr. Secretary, one of the hallmarks of IIJA was making 
more transportation funding available directly to local governments and 
other entities beyond State DOTs.
    Question 3.a. Can you comment on actions DOT has taken to support 
local governments as they attempt to navigate and succeed in accessing 
available funding?
    Answer. The Department has both new and existing technical 
assistance programs that provide hands-on support for project sponsors 
as they seek to apply for federal funding. These include the new 
Thriving Communities Initiative, as well as the Reconnecting 
Communities Pilot Program (RCP), and the Rural Opportunities to Use 
Transportation for Economic Success (ROUTES) Initiative.
    DOT's Thriving Communities Initiative launched this year and will 
help provide easier access to resources and best practices and help 
clarify federal grant requirements and processes. The RCP includes $30 
million for technical assistance, and through the Thriving Communities 
Initiative, DOT will use the funds to support communities interested in 
applying to the program in future years. The Department is committed to 
ensuring that all communities who may have an interest in applying for 
these programs have as much information as possible to help them 
prepare applications. We have been holding numerous program webinars; 
developing resources, FAQs, and fact sheets; training DOT division and 
regional staff; and expanding our outreach to as many potential 
applicants as possible. For instance, the RCP has held 11 webinars 
including focused sessions for Tribal communities, for the National 
Governors Association, for construction grants applicants, and for 
community health partners with over 11,000 attendees in total.
    DOT is also making special efforts to reach rural and Tribal 
communities for whom resource and capacity constraints make it 
difficult to apply for discretionary grant programs. Closely 
coordinating with the Thriving Communities Initiative, the ROUTES 
initiative seeks to address disparities in rural and Tribal 
transportation infrastructure by developing user-friendly tools and 
information, aggregating DOT resources, and providing technical 
assistance to better connect rural project sponsors with the funding, 
financing, and outreach resources available. The ROUTES website 
provides a one-stop shop for information for rural applicants, and 
ROUTES will be releasing an update of its comprehensive Grant Applicant 
Toolkit in early 2023 to provide information on the new Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law programs as well as DOT's continuing discretionary 
grant programs.
    The Department also created the DOT Navigator, a new resource to 
help communities apply for grants, and to plan for and deliver 
transformative infrastructure projects and services. The DOT Navigator 
provides general information to help communities develop grant 
applications and understand frequently required documents. It provides 
a menu of technical assistance resources, including contacts for DOT 
regional and field offices, available to help new and repeat grantees.
    Lastly, in August 2022, DOT awarded more than $2.2 billion from the 
Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity 
(RAISE) program to help urban and rural communities move forward on 
projects that modernize roads, bridges, transit, rail, ports, and 
intermodal transportation and make our transportation systems safer, 
more accessible, more affordable, and more sustainable.

    Question 3.b. As you engage local governments, tracking best 
practices in outreach and technical assistance would be very 
instructive to Congress to inform the next surface transportation bill. 
Is that something you'd be willing to share with this Committee after 
you've gone through a few rounds of funding?
    Answer. Yes. DOT is developing several metrics and methods to track 
the effectiveness and breadth of our outreach efforts. For example, we 
are mapping participation in our webinars by zip code. We are also 
including evaluation methods into the design of new programs like 
Thriving Communities and Reconnecting Communities. To help inform the 
Thriving Communities program, DOT published a Request for Information 
in the Federal Register that was open August 5th to August 26th. The 
comments we received are being used to help shape our programs and 
future technical assistance efforts.

  Questions from Hon. Sam Graves to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of 
           Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. Part of the PIPES Act of 2020 (PIPES Act) included 
authorization for additional personnel with expertise in pipeline 
safety, facilities, and systems, as the agency has struggled with 
staffing.\1\ However, we were concerned to see the Pipeline and 
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) indicate it will be 
hiring attorneys, environmental economists, and climate change and 
mitigation staff, rather than those with pipeline expertise, as 
directed by Congress.\2\ What is the status of hiring the personnel 
authorized by the PIPES Act? How many personnel have been hired or are 
in the process of being hired? Can you please detail the number of new 
attorneys hired, the number of environmental economists hired, the 
number of climate change and mitigation staff hired, and the number of 
staff with expertise in pipeline safety, facilities, and systems hired?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ P.L. 116-260 (2020), Section 102.
    \2\ Twitter, PHMSA_DOT, Mar. 26, 2021, https://twitter.com/
PHMSA_DOT/status/1375479993304760320; See also: DOT, Budget Estimates 
Fiscal Year 2023 Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration, (2023), https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/
files/2022-03/PHMSA_Budget_Estimates_FY23.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer. PHMSA successfully onboarded four full-time employees (two 
general engineers; an attorney advisor; and a technical writer) and an 
additional position (economist) is in the pre-onboarding background 
investigation process. All of these positions have been filled with 
candidates with pipeline safety or specific discipline expertise to 
support rulemaking efforts and fulfill congressional mandates. Another 
position was previously filled but the incumbent resigned for a 
position outside the federal government. Three positions (two general 
engineers/physical scientists and an operations research analyst) are 
in re-recruitment development status as the previously selected 
candidates declined offers. PHMSA is actively recruiting for the 
remaining positions, despite an increasingly competitive hiring 
environment. To this end, PHMSA continues to apply all hiring 
flexibilities and incentives to the recruitment and hiring process. To 
ensure continuity of the mission of PHMSA, the agency has re-allocated 
existing personnel resources where appropriate and practicable. 
Rulemaking entails a multidisciplinary approach and requires a hiring 
strategy to recruit employees with expertise in a variety of 
disciplines, including law and economics, to ensure the promulgation of 
comprehensive, clear, and concise rules that meet a myriad of statutory 
mandates such as cost-benefit analysis.

    Question 2. As you know, the PIPES Act of 2020 requires PHMSA to 
hold a GPAC meeting on the class location rule no later than December 
27, 2021.\3\ Recognizing that we are now in July 2022, can you please 
inform the committee about why PHMSA has not held a meeting yet and 
when they plan on doing so?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ P.L. 116-260 (2020), Section 115.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer. The PIPES Act of 2020 included an aggressive timeline for 
the agency to advance rulemakings (as well as other congressional 
directives), and PHMSA has completed several of these rulemakings with 
important safety impacts related to remote-control valves, gas 
gathering pipelines, and increased protections for unusually sensitive 
areas. At the same time, as mandated by the PIPES Act of 2020, PHMSA 
has initiated new rulemakings related to leak detection and gas 
distribution pipelines and continues work on the rest of the regulatory 
agenda, including changes to class location requirements.
    PHMSA is in the process of a third-party assessment of our special 
permit process, which is often used by operators to address class 
location changes within their system. In order to optimize utilization 
of our advisory committee--to make efficient use of the agency's staff 
time as well as the advisory committee members' time, we believe it is 
best to have the assessment of these safety conditions complete and 
available for discussion. To this end, we anticipate holding a GPAC 
meeting on the class location rulemaking after the conclusion of our 
special permit process review, which includes a review of the safety 
conditions that are used in the special permit process and their 
effectiveness in providing safety. The results of this assessment will 
be used for determining the effectiveness of the special permit process 
and the usage of similar safety requirements for class location change 
rulemaking.

    Question 3. Technology is offering great benefits to the 
transportation sector, including the transportation safety. Pipeline 
operators are harnessing ultrasound and MRI technology used in doctor's 
offices to better inspect their pipelines. Artificial intelligence and 
machine learning are helping sift through safety data and improve risk 
modeling. Do you support the greater application of advanced 
technologies and methodologies to pipeline safety?
    Answer. Yes, in fact, PHMSA's Research and Development (R&D) 
program supports and encourages the development of new technologies and 
methodologies to further improve pipeline safety. PHMSA's R&D program 
continues to sponsor research on projects that can provide near-term 
solutions to improve safety, reduce environmental impacts, and enhance 
the reliability of the nation's pipeline transportation system. PHMSA's 
R&D program also supports and encourages testing and evaluation of 
these new technologies and methodologies to ensure that they are safe 
and effective.
    Since 2002, PHMSA has invested nearly $168 million dollars in 380 
R&D projects, some of which have been commercialized, such as new 
technologies for methane leak detection. Since the program's inception, 
34 patent applications and 35 new pipeline technologies have hit the 
market, including above-ground, radar-based pipeline mapping and a 
robotic nondestructive testing method for pipelines that cannot 
accommodate traditional in-line inspection tools. A full list of 
previously funded pipeline safety research projects that have resulted 
in commercialized technologies can be found on PHMSA's R&D website.\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    PHMSA's R&D program also takes a far-reaching view with its 
Competitive Academic Agreement Program (CAAP), which funds academic 
research to provide tomorrow's pipeline safety workforce with an early 
opportunity to contribute safety solutions. The CAAP program, launched 
in 2013, has worked greatly to expose the next generation of engineers 
to the pipeline industry while providing them the opportunity to 
develop and deliver cutting-edge research and technology solutions to 
solve today's pipeline safety challenges.

  Question from Hon. Steve Cohen to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of 
           Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. Secretary Buttigieg, because of a horrific underrides 
crash in my district that took the life of Michael Higginbotham, I have 
been working with Senator Gillibrand and Representative Mark DeSaulnier 
to strengthen safety measures to prevent such accidents in the future. 
I was proud that we got several provisions of our Stop Underrides Act 
signed into law in the IIJA, and I commend your Administration for 
recently announcing comprehensive actions to increase underride 
protection on truck trailers and prevent deadly crashes. These actions, 
such as establishing the Federal advisory committee on underride 
protection and publishing proposed rulemaking to consider requirements 
for side underride guards, will help to improve protection for both 
drivers and passengers.
    As part of this announcement, NHTSA also proposed a final rule 
upgrading the strength of rear underride guards. Despite clear 
direction issued by Congress in the bill, the rule drops the 
requirement for the guard to prevent underride in ``30%'' overlap 
situations. I've been hearing from safety advocates that this proposed 
rule does not go far enough to improve safety and is inconsistent with 
the aspirations of the National Roadway Safety Strategy.
    I am concerned it will substantially harm safety by setting a 
standard that reduces the existing market for stronger rear underride 
guards as proposed in the IIJA, despite NHTSA estimating the cost for 
these guards can be as low as $100.
    Mr. Secretary, do you share this concern and would you be 
supportive of any efforts to reconsider this final rule?
    Answer. Safety is the Department of Transportation's (DOT) top 
priority, and the Department remains steadfast in implementing the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) mandates. BIL mandated requiring 
rear impact guards that prevent passenger compartment intrusion (PCI) 
in a 30 percent overlap crash condition, if such a requirement meets 
the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act 
(Safety Act).
    The Safety Act authorizes prescribing standards that are 
reasonable, practicable, meet motor vehicle safety needs, and takes 
into consideration whether the standard is reasonable, practicable, and 
appropriate for all vehicle and equipment types; and the extent to 
which the standard will reduce deaths and injuries associated with 
traffic crashes.
    NHTSA issued the final rule on July 15, 2022, upgrading rear impact 
protection in crashes of passenger vehicles into the rear of trailers, 
in accordance with BIL, the Safety Act, and the best available science. 
The final rule requires rear impact guards on trailers and semitrailers 
with sufficient strength and energy absorption to protect occupants of 
passenger vehicles in 35 mph crashes in both full overlap and 50 
percent overlap conditions. NHTSA carefully considered requiring rear 
impact guards to prevent PCI in 30 percent overlap crashes and 
concluded that such a requirement would not meet the requirements of 
the Safety Act.
    In accordance with the research mandate in BIL, NHTSA is conducting 
additional research on the design and development of rear impact guards 
that can protect passenger vehicle occupants in crashes into the rear 
of trailers at crash speeds up to 65 mph. As part of this research, 
NHTSA will also evaluate potential rear impact guard designs that could 
improve protection in the less-frequent 30 percent low overlap crashes 
while enhancing protection in full and 50 percent overlap crashes at 
higher speeds. NHTSA will evaluate the results of this research and 
consider the recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Underride 
Protection to identify potential next steps.

 Questions from Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, 
     Secretary of Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. Secretary Buttigieg, considering the rural nature of 
the North Country and New York's 21st Congressional District, the need 
for reliable methods of transportation is critical.
    Recently Congresswoman Elise Stefanik sent a letter to Amtrak's CEO 
urging them to immediately resume operations on the Adirondack line 
between Albany and Montreal, which runs through her Congressional 
District. The Adirondack line has yet to resume service after ceasing 
operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The rail line is operating 
solely between New York City and Albany before turning around and 
leaving Upstate New York and the North Country without critical 
transportation.
    Despite the delays on the Adirondack line, Amtrak's Maple Leaf line 
resumed operations from New York City to Toronto and Ontario on June 
27, 2022. The continued delays in service without explanations are 
concerning, especially considering Amtrak wants to expand its 
operations instead of fixing its existing lines.
    Question 1.a. Why have agreements with our Canadian partners been 
regarding resumption of Amtrak's Maple Leaf line and not the Adirondack 
line?
    Answer. DOT strongly supports resuming transportation services that 
were halted due to the pandemic, including intercity passenger rail. 
Our Department is not a party to specific agreements between Amtrak and 
their host railroads, but always encourages parties to work toward 
resumption of services and the long-term expansion of passenger rail 
service across the U.S. through the historic investment opportunities 
in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

    Question 1.b. Is the Adirondack line fully staffed? Are the crews 
qualified and requalified to operate the rail lines?
    Answer. Our Federal Railroad Administration is in regular 
communication with Amtrak. Amtrak has indicated that it is working to 
qualify crews for the eventual return of Adirondack service even as it 
faces crew constraints across its network.

    Question 1.c. How has the sale of the rail infrastructure in and 
around Montreal between Canadian National (CN) and CDPQ Infra impacted 
the agreements between the United States and Canada?
    Answer. FRA understands that Amtrak is working actively to restore 
Adirondack service in partnership with the state sponsor, host 
railroads, and others. FRA is unaware of any agreements with Canada 
that discuss or are affected by rail infrastructure sales.

    Question 1.d. Please provide a timeline by which the Adirondack 
line will return to full operating capacity and an explanation of the 
ongoing delays.
    Answer. Amtrak has told FRA that it hopes to restore Adirondack 
service as soon as possible, but operational complexities related to 
cross-border service make setting a firm target difficult.

Questions from Hon. John Garamendi to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of 
           Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. Mr. Secretary, the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
included my legislation with Senators Stabenow (D-MI) and Baldwin (D-
WI) finally creating a uniform, governmentwide ``Buy American'' 
standard for federally funded infrastructure projects, including 
transportation and public works projects built with federal grant funds 
or financing. Under the 2021 law, this new governmentwide ``Buy 
American'' standard and any waiver granted on a case-by-case basis is 
supposed to be coordinated by the newly authorized Made in America 
Office at the White House. Mr. Secretary, can you please speak to what 
your Department is doing to fully implement the new governmentwide 
``Buy American'' standard under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law?
    Answer. One of the Administration's top policy priorities is to 
support American workers and businesses by rebuilding our Nation's 
manufacturing base. On January 25, 2021, President Biden issued 
Executive Order 14005, Ensuring the Future is Made in All of America by 
All of America's Workers, which states that ``the United States 
Government should, consistent with applicable law, use terms and 
conditions of federal financial assistance awards and Federal 
procurements to maximize the use of goods, products, and materials 
produced in, and services offered in, the United States.'' As one of 
the leading federal agencies in providing financial assistance for 
infrastructure development projects and applying domestic content 
preference requirements (i.e., Buy America(n) requirements), the 
Department is committed to helping the President achieve this important 
goal.
    In accordance with the requirements found in section 70913 of the 
Build America, Buy America Act (BABA), part of the historic Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law (BIL), the Department developed a report entitled 
DOT's Identification of Federal Financial Assistance Infrastructure 
Programs Subject to the Build America, Buy America Provisions of the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The report provides a listing 
of the federal financial assistance programs for infrastructure 
administered by DOT; a discussion of the domestic content preference 
laws and requirements that apply to those programs; and identifies 
those programs that are currently not fully consistent with the 
requirements of section 70914 of the BABA.

    Question 2. In particular, will you commit to revoke the Federal 
Highway Administration's 1983 nationwide waiver exempting all 
``manufactured products'' from ``Buy America'' requirements (33 U.S. 
Code 313)? Congressional intent and federal law are now clear: all 
``manufactured projects'' used to construct federally funded 
transportation projects should be made in America, not just iron, 
steel, and reinformed cement products. However, that has not been the 
case for nearly 40 years due to this administrative ``Buy America'' 
waiver for federally funded highway projects. Again, Mr. Secretary, 
will you commit to review and modify this 1983 waiver to require that 
at least some ``manufactured products'' paid for with taxpayer funds 
for federal highway projects are required to be made in America as 
required by longstanding federal law and as reinforced by the 2021 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law?
    Answer. As stated above, as one of the leading federal agencies in 
providing financial assistance for infrastructure development projects 
and applying domestic content preference requirements (i.e., Buy 
America(n) requirements), the Department is committed to helping the 
President achieve this important goal. The BABA, part of BIL, requires 
federal agencies to review existing general applicability waivers (such 
as the FHWA manufactured products waiver) at least every five years, 
including by publishing a notice in the Federal Register seeking 
comment on the waiver and, after reviewing the comments received, 
publishing a subsequent notice on their determination of whether to 
continue or discontinue the waiver. OMB's initial implementation 
guidance for the BABA requirements also directed that, should the 
review justify retaining the waiver, agencies should consider narrowing 
the waiver in a manner that would support supply chain resilience and 
boost incentives to manufacture key products domestically, as 
appropriate. DOT and FHWA will soon be initiating those reviews in line 
with the requirements of the BABA.

    Question 3. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides over 
$110 billion to repair the nation's highways, bridges, and roads, 
including almost $40 billion to repair and replace our aging bridges. 
FHWA, DOD, GAO and other federal agencies have long held that 
utilization of coatings and corrosion mitigation and prevention 
industry best practices extends the lifecycle of our nation's 
infrastructure while enhancing public safety, protecting the 
environment, and saving taxpayer money. Although the House-passed 
version of H.R.3684 contained language mandating that state departments 
of transportation only utilize contractors on federal bridge projects 
that are certified to be operating under a corrosion management system 
that utilizes industry best practices, that language was unfortunately 
not included in the final law. As such, many state and local entities 
receiving federal highway and transit funding may not have corrosion 
management systems in place that will allow them to meet the 2021 law's 
goals of reducing the number of bridges in America in poor condition. 
Will you commit that your Department will work closely with eligible 
entities to assist them with the establishment or improvement of state 
and local corrosion management systems that include industry-recognized 
standards and corrosion mitigation and prevention methods?
    Answer. FHWA is committed to supporting States in addressing bridge 
corrosion through research and technical assistance to advance the 
state of practice in bridge preservation. Acting on recommendations 
made in the September 2021 Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
Report Highway Bridges: Federal Highway Administration Could Better 
Assist States with Information on Corrosion Practices, GA0-21-104249, 
FHWA plans to conduct two regional peer exchanges focused on corrosion 
mitigation before July 1, 2023: one for the midwest and northeast 
States, which have environments with arid conditions or that experience 
frequent freeze/thaw cycles and use de-icing chemicals on their highway 
bridges, and the other for the southeast States which have environments 
that experience freeze/thaw cycles and/or have highway bridges that are 
exposed to a saltwater environment. These peer exchanges will focus on 
States' practices and materials used that mitigate bridge corrosion. 
Based on these shared experiences and lessons learned, FHWA will also 
publish case studies or otherwise communicate the findings to help 
states to improve their bridge preservation programs.

    Question 4. Mr. Secretary, Chairman DeFazio and I worked with a 
bipartisan group of Members to enact the National Timing Reliance and 
Security Act of 2018 (Section 514 of Public Law 115-282). This law 
addresses the complete lack of resiliency for position, navigation, and 
timing (PNT) services, which are critical to the American 
infrastructure sector and nearly every citizen. We developed this 2018 
law after more than 15 years of studies and recommendations by the 
federal government and to codify the recommendations by the Obama 
Administration's PNT Executive Committee--chaired by the then-Deputy 
Secretaries of Transportation and Defense: First, the deployment of a 
land-based ``enhanced long-range navigation'' (eLoran) timing system to 
address this issue immediately; and second, a broader approach to cover 
all PNT vulnerabilities. As such, I was displeased and somewhat 
surprised to see that the President's Budget requests for FY2022 and 
FY2023 proposed the repeal of the National Timing Resilience and 
Security Act of 2018 (Section 514 of Public Law 115-282). When, where, 
and why did your Department decide against a land-based back-up GPS 
system, as recommended by the Obama PNT Executive Committee and 
required by Section 514 of Public Law 115-282?
    Answer. In 2020, DOT conducted a demonstration of a number of PNT 
technologies ranging from Terrestrial RF, Low Earth Orbit, Fiber Optic, 
and Map Match capabilities. The technologies tested provided a level of 
positioning, navigation, and/or timing performance (as documented in 
the Complementary PNT and GPS Backup Technologies Demonstration Report, 
prepared in response to Sec. 1606 of the National Defense Authorization 
Act for FY18). However, no single solution can provide GPS back-up or 
complementary positioning, navigation and/or timing services that can 
meet the diversity of critical infrastructure requirements.
    Also, it would be inefficient, anti-competitive, and potentially 
harmful to the existing market for back-up/complementary PNT services 
for the federal government to procure or otherwise fund a specific 
terrestrial solution for non-federal users, as described under the 
National Timing Resilience and Security Act of 2018 (NTRSA), which is 
the rationale for why the President's Budget has never requested 
funding to implement NTRSA and why the Administration has proposed in 
the FY 2022 and FY 2023 President's Budget to repeal this 
authorization.

    Question 5. I understand that the U.S. Department of Transportation 
is working to develop guidance on and distribution mechanisms for 
community project funds awarded by Congress for fiscal year 2022. 
Community project funds were intended to be spent expediently, with 
strong transparency and oversight requirements. However, it is my 
understanding that the Federal Transit Administration has not yet 
issued formal guidance to community project funding recipients, 
including those in my Congressional district. Would you please describe 
where the Federal Transit Administration is in its community project 
funding process and how the agency will work diligently to expediently 
deliver these funds in a transparent manner? Does the Federal Transit 
Administration plan to deliver these funds through its existing formula 
mechanisms or is it considering a different process?
    Answer. On April 6, 2022, FTA made the community project funds 
available within its electronic grant system, TrAMS, and published the 
list of projects on the FTA website: https://www.transit.dot.gov/
funding/apportionments/table-20-fy-2022-transit-infrastructure-grants-
community-project.
    FTA issued Formal Guidance on this funding on April 28, 2022 as 
part of the Federal Register Notice of FTA Transit Program Changes, 
Authorized Funding Levels and Implementation of the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act; and FTA Fiscal Year 2022 Apportionments, 
Allocations, Program Information and Interim Guidance. See Chapter IV, 
Section R FY 2022 Transit Infrastructure Grants--Community Project 
Funding/ Congressionally Directed Spending at: https://www.govinfo.gov/
content/pkg/FR-2022-04-28/pdf/2022-09143.pdf.
    These funds are being administered consistent with FTA formula 
funds and/or projects selected competitively. The identified recipient 
applies for the project in FTA's electronic grant making system, TrAMS, 
working with the applicable FTA Regional Office.

 Question from Hon. Rodney Davis to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of 
           Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. Public-private partnerships can help stretch the 
Federal dollar further. One provision I've been monitoring from the 
IIJA is Section 71001, Asset Concessions, which provides technical 
assistance and other resources to state and local transportation 
agencies that are interested in engaging the private sector in public 
private partnership, asset concessions, and other innovative financing. 
Can you update me on the status of this new program?
    Answer. DOT's Build America Bureau is finalizing a Notice of 
Funding Opportunity for this program, which we expect to announce to 
the public by the end of this calendar year. This program will break 
new ground by facilitating access to expert services and grants to help 
eligible applicants evaluate public-private partnerships and other 
innovative financing.

    Questions from Hon. Henry C. ``Hank'' Johnson, Jr. to Hon. Pete 
      Buttigieg, Secretary of Transportation, U.S. Department of 
                             Transportation

Capital Investment Grants (C-I-G) program and Transit:
    Question 1. For decades, communities of color and low-income 
communities have been ill-served by our transportation system--they 
face a higher burden of pollution and fewer affordable, safe 
transportation options. One means to address this is to build more 
high-quality transit lines, such as the Atlanta-area transit agency 
MARTA's proposal for the Southlake Bus Rapid Transit project, which 
will serve an area made up of 93 percent minority individuals. The 
Southlake BRT project is in the pipeline for the federal Capital 
Investment Grants (C-I-G) program. The Federal Transit Administration 
is currently developing new guidance for the C-I-G program, which will 
significantly influence which projects qualify and receive funding in 
the future.
    Mr. Secretary, how will your department ensure this new guidance, 
and the C-I-G program generally, will support equity and deliver real 
results for underserved communities?
    Answer. The Capital Investment Grant (CIG) Program project 
evaluation criteria in existence today already incorporate equity 
considerations, and FTA is currently examining ways the program can be 
improved to further advance equity and improve projects delivered for 
underserved communities. The existing mobility criterion gives double 
credit to trips forecast to be made on the proposed project by transit 
dependent persons (those who are either in the lowest income category 
or do not own cars, however that is defined locally). The existing land 
use criterion includes an examination of population, employment, and 
affordable housing that exists today in the proposed project corridor, 
while the Economic Development criterion examines the plans and 
policies in place locally to maintain and increase affordable housing. 
Additionally, FTA published a Request for Information in the Federal 
Register in 2021 that sought public input on ways equity considerations 
could be further incorporated in the CIG project evaluation process. 
FTA is reviewing the extensive comments received and plans to propose 
revised CIG guidance for public comment in 2023.

NDAA Amendment:
    Question 2. Mr. Secretary, the House recently passed an amendment 
to the NDAA that I authored, which relates to the Disadvantaged 
Business Enterprise program applicable to highway, transit, and safety 
programs. The amendment eliminates the gross receipts cap in effect for 
DBEs working on surface transportation projects. This amendment ensures 
that the definition of a DBE is consistent across DOT programs, as it 
brings surface transportation in line with how the FAA defines a DBE 
and ensures that DOT follows SBA definitions for a small business.
    Question 2.a. Do you support the elimination of the gross receipts 
cap for surface transportation programs?
    Answer. Yes. The amendment removes the average annual gross 
receipts limit authorized in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) in 
favor of the Small Business Administration's (SBA) government-wide 
small business size standards under the North American Industry 
Classification System.

    Question 2.b. What additional steps is your Department taking to 
promote maximum participation by DBEs in DOT programs?
    Answer. The DBE program is designed to help give small, 
disadvantaged businesses a fair opportunity to compete for DOT-funded 
contracts by addressing ongoing and continuing effects of past 
discrimination in highway, transit, and airport contracting projects as 
well as airport concession contracts that are not DOT-funded. This 
continues to be a top priority for the Department and the 
Administration.
    DOT funding recipients and transit vehicle manufacturers are 
required to set narrowly tailored goals for DBE participation based on 
their contracting needs and relative availability of DBEs as compared 
to all firms in their local markets. DOT works with the relevant 
operating administrations to assist recipients in meeting regulatory 
requirements to ensure DBEs have a fair opportunity to compete by 
providing technical assistance and sharing best practices. DOT also 
provides technical assistance to applicant and certified firms, 
continually looking for methods to streamline the certification 
process. The Operating Administrations develop ways to ensure 
compliance while eliminating ineffective practices by creating 
monitoring and oversight tools to assist recipients in removing 
barriers to participation while meeting regulatory requirements. The 
Department provides frequent training to funding recipients, and the 
operating administrations conduct complaint investigations and perform 
reviews when technical assistance is insufficient in remedying 
noncompliance. Additional efforts are described here:
    1.  The DBE Supportive Services (DBE/SS) Program is created by 
statute and applies to Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) recipients 
only. DBE/SS supports the DBE program by helping states train DBEs, 
improve their business practices, overcome barriers to success, and 
assist the firms to become viable, self-sufficient, and capable of 
competing for, and performing in, DOT-assisted highway projects. DBE/SS 
funds are distributed among states that request funding through 
Statements of Work that meet regulatory requirements. The funds are 
distributed using an administrative formula based on States' shares of 
overall Federal-aid highway funding. While state DOTs are not required 
to have a DBE/SS program, DOTs accepting DBE/SS funds are required to 
include a business development element as part of their DBE program. 
Business Development Programs (BDPs) evaluate firms individually and 
provide a structured process for the DBEs to receive firm-specific 
training and guidance to be competitive within the heavy highway 
marketplace. The DBE/SS program is authorized at $10 million per year 
for FY 2022 through FY 2026. DBE/SS funds are eligible for a 100 
percent federal share, with no matching funds from the State required.
    2.  Recent Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFOs) for discretionary 
grant programs have noted that equity considerations, including 
utilization of DBEs, should be integrated into the planning, 
development, and implementation of transportation investments.
    3.  In Spring 2022, the Department conducted several webinars for 
our recipients on how to properly implement the DBE rule's provisions. 
This is in addition to operating administration specific trainings like 
the FAA's National Civil Rights Training Conference for Airports, 
FHWA's AASHTO Civil Rights Conference, and FTA's National Transit 
Institute DBE course.
    4.  The Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on 
July 21, 2022, that proposes numerous amendments to the program rules. 
Our proposals are intended to modernize and improve the DBE and Airport 
Concession DBE programs. DOT's DBE program staff conducted seven public 
outreach sessions to describe the major categories of changes being 
proposed and encourage public comment.
    5.  The FAA Office of Civil Rights (ACR) operates a program 
management system, FAA Connect, to track and ensure compliance with the 
Department's DBE regulations for airport and airport concession 
contracts under the FAA's ambit. ACR is currently working to add 
reporting and notification functionality to the FAA Connect toolset. In 
September, ACR executed an intra-agency agreement with DOT for further 
development to FAA Connect to allow a greater degree of interfacing by 
other DOT OAs with the system.
    6.  Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) 
promotes DBE participation by supporting state and local government 
entities through its Small Business Transportation Resource Centers 
(SBTRCs). SBTRCs provide an array of technical assistance to build the 
capacity of Small and Disadvantaged Businesses, making the businesses 
more competitive when bidding on DOT procurement opportunities and 
federally funded contracts. Services include the following:
        Business Analyses
        Market Research and Procurement Assistance
        General Management & Technical Assistance
        Business Counseling & Coaching
        Regional Planning Committees
        Liaison between Prime Contractors and Sub-Contractors
        Outreach/Conference Participation
        Capital Access and Bond Education and Surety Bond 
Assistance
        Women & Girls in Transportation Initiative (WITI)

Connected Vehicle Technologies:
    Question 3. Mr. Secretary--One NHTSA study estimates V2X, or 
vehicle-to-everything, technology can prevent up to 80% of all crashes 
involving non-impaired drivers. This could save thousands of lives and 
prevent or mitigate millions of crashes every year. In March last year 
you testified the spectrum is a very important priority for 
transportation communications and public safety. Since that time the 
FCC issued a ruling on spectrum and The National Transportation Safety 
Board issued safety recommendations to the FCC, to protect against 
harmful interference, and to the Department of Transportation to 
implement a plan for nationwide deployment of V2X technology.
    We know from recent history with the FAA and 5G that interference 
can be a concern. We would not want to see similar interagency dynamics 
transpire again and prevent V2X from being fully deployed and 
leveraged. How is the DOT working with the FCC protect the 5.9ghz V2X 
safety spectrum from the potential for harmful interference?
    Answer. The Department remains committed to deploying V2X 
technology as it offers a transformative way--using real-time data--to 
assess safety threats and hazards as they emerge on the roadway, 
including threats to vulnerable road users, and to enable warnings and 
other safety protections. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
removed a portion of spectrum, leaving DOT with 30 MHz, and changed the 
communication technology that would be allowed for V2X uses. We are 
beginning work with our stakeholders to prioritize a focused set of V2X 
safety applications to use in this smaller band and with the new 
cellular-based technology; and DOT is finalizing analysis to help the 
FCC understand the parameters from other devices (including 5G) to 
minimize interference--in particular, in-vehicle interference with the 
basic safety message. Further, our technical experts are looking at 
whether there are other ways in unlicensed bands to achieve V2X 
benefits outside of the 30 MHz--however, these alternative bands are 
more likely to face interference than the applications in the dedicated 
30 MHz spectrum band. DOT remains in communication with the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and FCC at the 
technical staff level.

    Question 4. I know that your priorities at the Department of 
Transportation include implementing the Infrastructure and Investment 
Jobs Act, reducing deaths on our roadways, and ensuring the US stays 
competitive and on the cutting edge in all forms of transportation 
technology but especially those that can save lives--like V2X.
    What is the Department of Transportation doing to advance and 
deploy this life saving technology as it works toward its goal of zero 
deaths on our roadways?
    Answer. The Department remains engaged and energized towards 
deploying V2X applications in the 30 MHz spectrum allocation under the 
FCC Report and Order. On August 24-25, 2022, the Department hosted over 
600 participants at a public event, ``Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) 
Communications Summit: Preparing for V2X Deployment'', held at DOT 
Headquarters. Representatives from the NTIA, FCC, National 
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Original Equipment Manufacturers 
(OEMs), Infrastructure Owners-Operators (IOOs), ITS America, Alliance 
for Automotive Innovation, American Association of State Highway and 
Transportation Officials, academia, and State and local governments 
attended, and both provided and heard updates on V2X testing and 
deployment from Department leadership, multi-modal technical teams, and 
leading-edge V2X deployers. The Department highlighted V2X deployment 
opportunities made available by grants funded through BIL, including 
the Advanced Transportation Technologies and Innovative Mobility 
Deployment (ATTIMD) (also known as Advanced Transportation Technology 
and Innovation (ATTAIN) Program), Strengthening Mobility and 
Revolutionizing Transportation (SMART), and Safe Streets and Roads for 
All (SSA4) programs.
    Attendees also took part in ``breakout'' discussions (live and 
virtually), focusing on the path forward with the 30 MHz of spectrum in 
the 5.9GHz band along with approaches to leverage other available and 
emerging communications options to enable V2X deployments. A key 
takeaway from some stakeholders was the desire for DOT--in consultation 
with, among others, OEMs, IOOs, tech companies and ITS America--to 
develop a vision for interoperable and cybersecure connected deployment 
nationwide by continuing to work in an open and collaborative manner 
with the FCC and NTIA.

Aviation:
    Question 5. Atlanta Hartsfield just received a $40 million grant to 
modernize their terminal under the IIJA's Airport Terminal Program.
    Question 5.a. Secretary Buttigieg how will this project, and other 
IIJA terminal expansion projects, will benefit passengers in the 
future?
    Answer. The Atlanta Hartsfield project will widen Concourse D to 
increase capacity and accessibility by enlarging hold rooms, increasing 
the central corridor width for passenger flow and movement, and 
ensuring the restrooms meet current ADA compliance standards. These 
improvements will enhance mobility for individuals with disabilities 
and cart mobility for those needing transportation within the 
concourse.
    Many projects selected for FY 2022 Airport Terminal Program funding 
provide similar improvements to terminals and upgrades to jet bridges, 
baggage claim systems, and roadways leading to the terminal.

    Question 5.b. Airport Terminal Program also includes projects that 
``improve access for historically disadvantaged populations''. Has the 
FAA awarded or plans to award any grants under this specific criteria? 
And what some of these projects may look like?
    Answer. The FAA considered projects that improve airport access for 
historically disadvantaged populations when making project selections 
for the FY 2022 Airport Terminal Program (ATP). The FY 2022 ATP 
projects announced by the Secretary on July 7, 2022, include 58 
projects ($958 million) that indicated they would improve access for 
historically disadvantaged populations. Examples include:
      Spokane International Airport (GEG)--The Concourse C 
project of the Terminal Renovation and Expansion Program (TREX). The 
GEG market serves 41 historically disadvantaged population census 
tracks. Increasing terminal capacity enhances mobility/accessibility 
for farmers & migrant workers, Kalispel and Spokane Tribal members, and 
Alaskan natives living/working in the region. The project includes 
concession areas for Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE), Woman 
Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (WDBE), and Veteran-owned and small 
start-up businesses.
      Eppley Airfield (OMA)--Improve Terminal Building/Modify 
Access Road, Phase 3 project. Constructs a new terminal drop-off area, 
increasing capacity by 65 percent with seven lanes and a full canopy. 
The project includes improved curb areas for ADA compliance and public 
transportation. OMA is located in a historically disadvantaged area 
(HDA). The airport's engagement with the local transit authority on an 
expanded 7-day/week bus route is directly linked to HDAs. The project 
provides workforce accessibility and enhances multi-modal options 
(including public buses) for passengers and vehicles.
      Denver International Airport (DEN)--Replace baggage 
handling system curbside conveyors and controls. Replacement is for 
original equipment installed in 1994 that is past its useful life. This 
project will help DEN achieve its goal of increasing passenger volume 
from 69 million annual passengers (MAP) to 100 MAP in the next 10 
years. DEN commits to expanding prime contractor opportunities for 
minority businesses in Underserved Communities to create generational 
wealth with these procurements following the Administration's Executive 
Order 13985 (Advancing Racial Equity) and its Justice 40 provision.

Stronger Communities Through Better Transit Act:
    Question 6. Mr. Secretary, Transit in our communities is as 
essential as food on our tables, clothes on our backs and a roof over 
our heads. That's why last year I introduced the Stronger Communities 
Through Better Transit Act that I authored, which would provide $20 
billion annually for four years ($80B total) to transit systems for 
their operating budgets. The bill aims to provide more frequent service 
on bus and rail lines, and to prioritize that service to places with 
existing poor service, disadvantaged communities and areas of 
persistent poverty.
    Mr. Secretary, how will your department ensure that public transit 
is able to receive the operating support it needs?
    Answer. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) substantially 
increased funding for public transportation, authorizing $108 billion 
between FY 2022 through FY 2026--the most significant federal 
investment in transit in the nation's history. These funds include 
substantial increases to formula and competitive programs that can be 
used to deliver more frequent service on bus and rail lines and improve 
service provision for disadvantaged communities and in areas of 
persistent poverty.

 Questions from Hon. David Rouzer to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of 
           Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. Has the Department of Transportation provided any 
comment or analysis to the Environmental Protection Agency, Army Corps 
of Engineers, Office of Management and Budget, or any other executive 
branch agency related to the Biden Administration's announced or 
ongoing actions related to changing the definition of Waters of the 
United States under the Water Pollution Control Act from that 
promulgated under the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Rule? If so, 
what form has this taken?
    Answer. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is an active 
participant in the interagency regulatory review process on any 
rulemaking developed by another federal agency that could have an 
impact on our programs and policies.

    Question 2. Has the Department of Transportation conducted any 
analysis or review of how the Biden Administration's announced or 
ongoing actions related to changing the definition of Waters of the 
United States under the Water Pollution Control Act from that 
promulgated under the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Rule will affect 
infrastructure projects conducted or funded by the Department? If so, 
what form has this taken?
    Answer. As mentioned in the previous answer, DOT is an active 
participant in the interagency regulatory review process on any 
rulemaking developed by another federal agency that could have an 
impact on our programs and policies.

  Questions from Hon. Dina Titus to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of 
           Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. Secretary Buttigieg, I know your office has a 
tremendous lift in getting award notices and notices for funding 
opportunities out in the required timeframes. While many are eager and 
grateful for the opportunity to apply for additional funds, the time 
lapse between award announcements could mean applicants feel pressure 
to use precious time and resources to apply for alternative funding 
opportunities as they await news on pending applications.
    Question 1.a. Are there any steps the Administration can take to 
move more quickly in reviewing applications and awarding grants?
    Answer. The large increase in funding made available under the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) as well as the creation of many new 
programs has inspired more communities to seek federal discretionary 
grant funding than ever before. Despite the unprecedented challenge, we 
are fully committed to ensuring thousands of grant applications receive 
full and fair consideration in a timely manner. We are making progress 
expanding the teams responsible for grant review and have made efforts 
to coordinate our reviews on several major grant programs.

    Question 1.b. Does the Administration have any plans to allow 
applicants to ``bundle'' applications as you did with the Multimodal 
Funding Discretionary Grant which covers the INFRA, MEGA, and RURAL 
programs?
    Answer. The Department is very conscious of applicant burden when 
establishing new programs and must constantly balance streamlining with 
requesting sufficient information to address a wide variety of 
statutory requirements. As the Department reviews the first year of the 
Multimodal Discretionary Grant program, we will make every effort to 
consider how the combined solicitation model could be improved upon in 
future years.

    Question 2. Secretary Buttigieg, as you may be aware, my district 
contains portions of Las Vegas, which has been identified as one of the 
fastest warming cities in the country. Our region has ranked at or near 
the top of the list of cities with heat island impacts over the last 
two decades, with Las Vegas experiencing summer temperatures that are 
an astonishing 24 degrees warmer than the rural areas surrounding the 
valley. Extreme conditions can cause buses to break down more often--
but at the same time, transit operators are limited on the number of 
spare buses they can keep in their fleet to comply with the FTA's spare 
ratio policy.
    Accordingly, have you given consideration to increasing the spare 
ratio for transit operators, particularly those in regions with extreme 
weather? This would enable operators to quickly deploy vehicles in 
response to breakdowns, helping maintain service for riders.
    Answer. FTA's spare ratio policy ensures that buses procured with 
federal funds are used for their intended purpose--to provide public 
transportation services for American communities--and ensures transit 
agencies provide appropriate maintenance for their fleets. For 
operators of 50 or more buses in fixed-route service, FTA permits 
agencies to procure spare buses up to 20 percent of the number of 
vehicles operated in maximum fixed-route service. For example, if a 
transit agency operates 100 fixed-route vehicles during peak service, 
FTA permits it to have 20 additional vehicles as spares. In addition to 
these spares, FTA permits transit agencies to retain vehicles past 
their useful life as part of a contingency fleet for emergencies or 
unforeseen events, such as extreme weather events, or for the 
introduction of zero-emission buses. These contingency vehicles are not 
included in the spare ratio. Combined, the spare ratio and contingency 
fleet policy ensure that substantial federal investments in buses 
result in assets staying in productive service while recognizing the 
operational needs of transit agencies in times of emergency.

    Question 3. Secretary Buttigieg, you recognize the importance of 
infrastructure projects for the growth of our communities and the role 
transit plays in addressing the climate crisis, doubly so for a fast-
growing State like Nevada. A great example is the RTC of Southern 
Nevada's Maryland Parkway Bus Rapid Transit project which will enhance 
mobility along a key corridor for our region.
    Given the current economic climate, can you speak to how DOT is 
helping transit agencies deal with inflation and keep critical projects 
like converting to zero-emission fleets on track?
    Answer. BIL substantially increased funding for public 
transportation, authorizing $108 billion between FY 2022 through FY 
2026--the most significant federal investment in transit in the 
nation's history. On August 16, 2022, FTA announced $1.66 billion in 
grants to transit agencies, territories, and states across the country 
to invest in 150 bus fleets and facility projects. Funded by BIL, more 
than 1,100 of those vehicles will use zero-emissions technology, which 
reduces air pollution and helps meet the President's goal of net-zero 
emissions by 2050. This year's funding alone will nearly double the 
number of no-emission transit buses on America's roadways.
    FTA's Low or No Emission (Low-No) Grant Program makes funding 
available to help transit agencies buy or lease U.S.-built low- or no-
emission vehicles, including related equipment or facilities. The BIL 
provides $5.5 billion over five years for the Low-No Program--more than 
six times greater than the previous five years of funding. For FY 2022, 
approximately $1.17 billion was available for grants under this 
program.
    For the first time, five percent of low- and no-emission bus 
funding will also be used to train transit workers on how to maintain 
and operate new clean bus technology. To support transit agencies as 
they develop workforce fleet transition plans, FTA's first workforce 
technical assistance center--the Transit Workforce Center (TWC)--
created and posted on their website targeted resources to help transit 
agencies develop these important plans. The TWC is also providing 
direct workforce development technical assistance upon request to 
select transit agencies. The TWC has released a recruiting toolkit that 
transit agencies can tailor for their specific workforce needs. These 
actions will help recruit, retain, and train the transit workforce 
needed today and tomorrow to safely maintain and operate new clean bus 
technologies.
    Funding for zero-emission vehicles is also available in FTA's other 
formula and competitive programs. For example, FTA's grants for Buses 
and Bus Facilities Program supports transit agencies in buying and 
rehabilitating buses and vans and building bus maintenance facilities. 
The BIL provides nearly $2 billion over five years for the program. For 
FY 2022, approximately $550 million for grants was available under this 
program.
    FTA has been engaging a variety of stakeholders, including transit 
agencies and the private sector, to better understand the challenges 
they face and how FTA can best support the transit industry as it 
navigates both the opportunities and challenges of this moment.

 Questions from Hon. Tim Burchett to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of 
           Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. The short line freight rail industry is made up of 
about 600 small business railroads. It's estimated that nearly $12 
billion of investment is needed to ensure the industry can meet the 
needs of the economy.
    Six weeks ago, 24 short lines were awarded CRISI grants to improve 
rail safety and make the network more efficient. Federal Railroad 
Administrator Bose testified before this committee on the importance of 
CRISI for short lines.
    Can you discuss your commitment to use the CRISI program to improve 
supply chain efficiency and invest in key safety goals, like allowing 
short line freight rail to upgrade and make important repairs?
    Answer. Short line railroads are a vital element in our freight 
supply chain and conduit for essential transportation throughout the 
country. Improving their efficiency helps reduce costs and ensure 
Americans have dependable access to goods and services. DOT is fully 
committed to advancing rail infrastructure improvements through CRISI 
and other federal grant programs.
    Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), on September 2, 
2022, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued a new Notice of 
Funding Opportunity for the FY 2022 CRISI program, for over $1.4 
billion. This is the largest amount of funding ever made possible 
through this program. The CRISI program advances projects that 
modernize America's freight and passenger rail infrastructure, allowing 
people and goods to move more safely and efficiently and helping make 
goods more affordable for American families. The transformational 
funding will enable short line railroads to make key investments to 
repair and upgrade infrastructure to ensure they can continue to serve 
customers and increase capacity.

    Question 2. The Department of Transportation is moving forward with 
a new rule that could require railroads to hire more personnel or 
operate with more people on a train than is necessary.
    Question 2.a. Businesses across America are struggling to find hard 
workers--why would the agency consider forcing the rail industry to 
hire folks they don't need?
    Answer. As noted in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) 
published on July 28, 2022, titled ``Train Crew Size Safety 
Requirements,'' FRA proposed this rule to ensure that trains are 
adequately staffed for their intended operation and have appropriate 
safeguards in place for safe train operations, whenever using a crew of 
fewer than two persons. On October 27, 2022, FRA published notice that 
the public comment period for the NPRM had been extended until December 
21, 2022, and that a public hearing on the NPRM will be held on 
December 14, 2022. The in-person hearing will be held in Washington, 
DC, and an option for virtual participation will be provided. FRA 
encourages all stakeholders to submit their views and comments on the 
proposals outlined in the NPRM during the public comment period.

    Question 2.b. Doesn't it make more sense to let small business 
railroads invest in their infrastructure--which allows for a safer and 
more efficient rail network--instead of being forced to put more people 
on the payroll?
    Answer. FRA proposed this rule to ensure that trains are adequately 
staffed for their intended operation and have appropriate safeguards in 
place for safe train operations, whenever using a crew of fewer than 
two persons. FRA encourages all stakeholders to submit their views and 
comments on the proposals outlined in the NPRM during the public 
comment period.

    Question 2.c. Freight customers have serious complaints about 
freight rail service. If railroads can't meet your unnecessary 
requirements, isn't it possible that even fewer trains will run, 
further reducing service and increasing supply chain delays?
    Answer. As noted above, FRA's proposed rule is designed to ensure 
that trains are adequately staffed for their intended service. FRA 
welcomes comments from all stakeholders on the proposals included in 
the NPRM, including any potential unanticipated impacts of the proposed 
rule.

    Question 3. I previously asked you about third-party verification 
of roadside safety hardware test results.
    The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act included provisions to 
reduce conflicts of interest in crash testing and encourage 3rd party 
verification.
    What has the US Department of Transportation done to implement 
these provisions?
    Answer. Section 11517 of BIL states ``To the maximum extent 
practicable, the Secretary shall develop a process for third party 
verification of full-scale crash testing results from crash test labs, 
including a method for formally verifying the testing outcomes and 
providing for an independent pass/fail determination. In establishing 
such a process, the Secretary shall seek to ensure the independence of 
crash test labs by ensuring that those labs have a clear separation 
between device development and testing in cases in which lab employees 
test devices that were developed within the parent organization of the 
employee.'' The manner in which the Federal Highway Administration 
(FHWA) addresses the ``clear separation'' requirement will be 
influenced by the approach used in developing a third-party 
verification process.
    After a GAO Report was issued on this subject, FHWA began 
contacting accreditation bodies, crash-test laboratories, and industry 
to research organizations capable of conducting third-party 
verification of testing. FHWA and the American Association of State 
Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) worked to identify a 
strategy and organization qualified to conduct a third-party 
verification to move to the implementation phase. FHWA and AASHTO also 
coordinated with crash test laboratories and the American Traffic 
Safety Services Association, which represents the roadside hardware 
industry, to gain further insights in developing a third-party process. 
Detailed discussions took place with two different prominent 
international organizations. First, FHWA contacted the American Society 
of Testing and Materials (ASTM) as a possible organization to do the 
third-party verification. FHWA held several meetings and a workshop 
with ASTM, AASHTO, and State DOTs. However, ASTM withdrew from the 
negotiations after concluding that third-party verification did not fit 
well within its business model. Based on recommendations, FHWA then 
held discussions with Underwriters Laboratories (UL). After these 
discussions in 2019, UL also ended negotiations after concluding third-
party verification did not fit with its business model either.
    With respect to a clear separation between device development and 
testing in cases where lab employees test devices that were developed 
within their parent organization, FHWA has a regulation (23 CFR 
637.209(a)(5)) that requires laboratories conducting crash testing to 
be accredited by a recognized accreditation body. The laboratories are 
accredited in accordance with International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) 17025, which requires conflict of interest checks 
prior to certification. FHWA will continue to find ways to ensure that 
there is a clearer separation of device development and crash testing 
as we work through options regarding third-party verification. We 
understand that organizations may be more likely to be involved in a 
third-party verification process if the Manual for Assessing Safety 
Hardware (MASH) were written as a performance specification. AASHTO is 
in the process of converting MASH into a set of performance 
specifications. This effort will take approximately three years to 
complete.

 Question from Hon. Jared Huffman to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of 
           Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. The IIJA included $800 million per year for culvert 
removal, replacement, and restoration to address fish passage. The 
money flows through DOT in coordination with NMFS. It is my 
understanding that FHWA has taken the lead within DOT. Could you please 
give us a status update of where this funding has gone to date and if 
you plan on tailoring the spending beyond block grants to states?
    Answer. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) establishes the 
National Culvert Removal, Replacement, and Restoration Grant program to 
provide funding, through a competitive grant program, for projects that 
would meaningfully improve or restore passage for anadromous fish. The 
BIL provides $1 billion in advance appropriations ($200 million 
annually) for the program for FY 2022 through FY 2026.
    This program is a Departmental priority, and we are working 
expeditiously to implement it. Since June 2022, the Department has been 
consulting with both National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to advance the program and take 
advantage of their experiences in similar programs. We also have been 
reaching out to and listening to Tribal and underserved communities to 
understand and integrate their important insights and needs. A Notice 
of Funding Opportunity was released for this competitive grant program 
in October 2022 and an external webinar on ``How to Apply for National 
Culvert Removal, Replacement, and Restoration Grants: General 
Overview'' was delivered later in the month. The Department anticipates 
making awards to eligible entities (a state, unit of local government, 
or Indian Tribe) to execute specific projects for replacement, removal, 
and repair of culverts or weirs that improve or restore passage for 
anadromous fish.

Questions from Hon. Brian J. Mast to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of 
           Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. How does the Department establish, prioritize, and 
track cybersecurity requirements for operational technology such as 
freight and passenger rail, and commercial aviation?
    Answer. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) National 
Airspace System (NAS) is designated as critical infrastructure and, as 
such, the systems that provide critical services to the aviation 
ecosystem function in an operational technology (OT) capacity. The Air 
Traffic Organization (ATO) utilizes a robust cybersecurity program to 
assess, analyze, prioritize and track cybersecurity requirements for 
system, services and assets. The FAA examines the agency's complete OT 
environment and works closely with stakeholders to understand the 
unique industry and internal workflow challenges. It makes best-in-
class enterprise recommendations to protect ATC infrastructure.
    The FAA tailors the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) guidance to Identify, Protect, 
Detect, Respond and Recover from vulnerabilities discovered in all OT 
assets, commensurate to the categorization and criticality of each 
system, services and data. Findings are then analyzed and measured, 
accounting for the exploitability, probability, impact, and 
compensations each control may have. Once the analysis is completed, 
the FAA performs an enterprise risk-based approach to prioritize and 
track the cybersecurity requirements that pose the highest risk and 
impact to aviation.
    FRA regulations developed in 2011 require cyber security for 
positive train control (PTC) communications. These regulations were 
developed in 2011 in consultation with TSA and other Government 
agencies and require cryptographic message integrity and 
authentication, consistent with the National Institute of Standards 
(NIST) approved algorithms. FRA also requires, as part of new 
technology development, testing and approval associated for locomotive 
electronics and signaling and train control (including PTC) systems, a 
risk and hazard assessment that is to take into account cyber security 
risks.
    FRA also works closely with TSA regarding rail cybersecurity. On 
December 2, 2021, TSA issued Security Directive 1580-21-01: ``Enhancing 
Rail Cybersecurity'' and 1582-21-01: ``Enhancing Public Transportation 
and Passenger Railroad Cybersecurity''. These directives apply to the 
seven (7) Class I freight railroads, rail hazardous materials shippers 
and any railroad that hosts Class I railroads and freight operations of 
rail hazardous materials and Amtrak and most passenger rail operators 
in major metropolitan areas (approximately 12). The directive went into 
effect December 31, 2021. The Security Directive requires the owner/
operator of an applicable railroad or railroad carrier to:
      Designate a Cybersecurity Coordinator who is required to 
be available to TSA and CISA 24/7 to coordinate cyber practices and 
address any incidents;
      Report cybersecurity incidents to CISA no later than 24 
hours after a cybersecurity incident is identified;
      Develop and adopt a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan; 
and
      Conduct a cybersecurity vulnerability assessment using a 
form provided by TSA.

    On October 18, 2022, TSA issued a revision and update to several 
security directives that specifically address cyber security. This is 
the culmination of a consultation process with industry. FRA provided 
technical and subject matter expertise throughout the process. Core to 
these updates is TSA's commitment to strong cybersecurity measures 
while providing flexibility in the implementation of security measures 
to achieve required security outcomes.
    In summary, the updated Directives expand the owner/operators 
subject to the Directives to include all railroads that support the 
Strategic Rail Corridor Network (STRACNET), the civil rail lines most 
important to national defense, provide policies and controls for 
railroad Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) 
systems, and require railroad owners/operators to:
      Develop and implement a Cybersecurity Implementation 
Plan;
      Establish a Cybersecurity Assessment Program and submit 
an annual plan to TSA; and
      Maintain an up-to-date Cybersecurity Incident Response 
Plan.

    Specific to the plans, processes, assessments, and mitigations for 
both IT systems and OT systems, FRA provided support primarily relating 
to OT systems, including Positive Train Control, locomotive control 
systems and other systems.
    Overall, the security directive updates have been issued due to the 
ongoing cybersecurity threat to surface transportation systems and 
associated infrastructure to protect against the significant harm to 
the national and economic security of the United States that could 
result from the ``degradation, destruction, or malfunction of systems 
that control this infrastructure.''

    Question 2. How will the Department ensure cyber security funds 
authorized in the Infrastructure and Jobs Act are accessible to 
organizations responsible for critical infrastructure? How will 
existing cybersecurity regulations at agencies like the TSA be 
prioritized?
    Answer. DOT has developed an approach for including cybersecurity 
requirements and guidance for discretionary and formula grants, 
respectively, that is supported by the National Security Council (NSC), 
and the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security 
Agency (TSA) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 
(CISA). This includes language in discretionary grant agreements 
requiring the consideration of cybersecurity subject to DOT and DHS 
approval, shown below.

        ``It is the policy of the United States to strengthen the 
        security and resilience of its critical infrastructure against 
        both physical and cyber threats. Each applicant selected for 
        Federal funding under this notice must demonstrate, prior to 
        the signing of the grant agreement, effort to consider and 
        address physical and cyber security risks relevant to the 
        transportation mode and type and scale of the project. Projects 
        that have not appropriately considered and addressed physical 
        and cyber security and resilience in their planning, design, 
        and project oversight, as determined by the Department and the 
        Department of Homeland Security, will be required to do so 
        before receiving funds for construction, consistent with 
        Presidential Policy Directive 21--Critical Infrastructure 
        Security and Resilience and the National Security Presidential 
        Memorandum on Improving Cybersecurity for Critical 
        Infrastructure Control Systems.''

    The approach also includes the use of TSA's previously developed 
requirements and guidance, required for discretionary grants, and 
issued as guidance for formula grants, shown below.
    Post-award, discretionary grantees are to take the following 
actions for programs and projects with medium and high cybersecurity 
risks, based on existing assessments, guidance, and requirements from 
TSA.
    We are developing communications for formula grantees urging them 
to take the following actions for programs and projects with medium and 
high cybersecurity risks, based on existing assessments, guidance, and 
requirements from TSA.
    Some of these projects may be subject to additional requirements 
and guidelines based on TSA's existing directives and guidance. These 
usually cover a particular DOT Operating Administration (OA), or a set 
of operators known to the OA and TSA. For example, high risk freight 
rail operators vs. low risk freight rail operators.
    1.  Designate a cybersecurity Point of Contact (POC)
    2.  Prepare a cybersecurity incident reporting plan
    3.  Prepare a cybersecurity incident response plan
    4.  Perform a self-assessment of current cybersecurity posture and 
capabilities

    Question 3. Given the ever-increasing interconnected nature of our 
modern freight, rail, and aviation platforms, how will the Department 
leverage funding in the Infrastructure and Jobs Act to ensure the 
protection of critical safety data onboard platforms and sensors?
    Answer. While cybersecurity funding for FAA is not specifically 
included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), cybersecurity is a 
priority for the agency. The FAA focuses on the development of 
cybersecurity risk management programs, information security standards 
and best practices consistent with the federal standards and guidance.
    The above support to TSA and FRA review of risk/hazard assessments 
as part of the TSA directive and FRA required safety analyses and plans 
is how FRA is approaching the increasing level of threats and risks, 
given locomotive cab and system integration trends.

    Question 4. What cybersecurity criteria does the Department 
consider essential for solution providers under the block grant program 
established under Sec. 11109?
    Answer. Section 11109 of BIL amended 23 U.S.C. 133(b) to add 
eligibility under the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program (STBG) 
for ``Measures to protect a transportation facility otherwise eligible 
for assistance under [the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program] 
from cybersecurity threats.'' FHWA issued guidance on the STBG Program, 
which notes this new eligibility.

    Question 5. How will the Department leverage the cyber tool 
development and resiliency work of other Departments and agencies as it 
works to develop its own tools as required by Sec. 11510?
    Answer. As required by section 11510(b)(2)(C) of BIL, FHWA will 
coordinate with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and 
the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in 
developing a tool to assist transportation authorities in identifying, 
detecting, protecting against, responding to, and recovering from cyber 
incidents. This coordination will provide an opportunity for FHWA to 
leverage the work of our co-sector specific agencies (TSA and CISA) in 
the development of this tool.

    Question from Hon. Frederica S. Wilson to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, 
     Secretary of Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. PortMiami is planning for the nation's first end-to-end 
Net Zero Carbon Emissions Resilient Supply Chain (Net Zero Program). 
This Net Zero Program presents a regional approach to resolving the 
nation's supply chain and climate challenges while achieving critical 
objectives of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). I ask 
you to close and carefully review PortMiami's Mega and INFRA grant 
applications.
    Answer. The Department was pleased to award a $16 million RAISE 
grant for the PortMiami Net Zero Program, to help expand intermodal 
rail capacity and optimize port gate operations. Related project 
components included in applications for other grant programs will 
receive full and fair consideration.

 Questions from Hon. Mark DeSaulnier to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary 
          of Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. The Bay Area is home to the highest concentration of 
megacommuters in the country, and four of the country's 10 worst 
megacommutes. Yet residents still are not drawn to use the local 
transit system, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), whose ridership has not 
returned to pre-pandemic levels. As you know, transit ridership numbers 
in the United States have always lagged behind our international 
counterparts and are not rebounding after the worst of the pandemic.
    Question 1.a. Coming out of the COVID pandemic, how do we get 
Americans to use transit like residents of Tokyo, Seoul, Paris, and 
Montreal where more than 50% of commutes are done on transit?
    Answer. While changes in commute trips and other activities are 
affecting transit travel, there is continuing evidence of growing 
transit ridership in many communities during 2022. Frequent, reliable, 
convenient, and safe service contribute to restoring ridership, and the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's (BIL) funding, safety provisions, and 
pilot programs will support the type of transit service that will help 
facilitate a continued return to transit.

    Question 1.b. What can we do to restore the public's faith in 
transit, including through measures like proper oversight of federal 
funds and improved safety?
    Answer. The BIL authorizes up to $108 billion for public 
transportation--the largest federal investment in public transportation 
in the nation's history. The legislation will advance public 
transportation in America's communities through four key priorities: 
safety, modernization, climate, and equity.
    Public transit is a safe form of transportation. Transit worker and 
rider safety is a top priority for the Administration and the 
Department of Transportation. Transit workers should expect a safe 
workplace and riders should expect a safe trip. FTA will continue to 
work with the transit agencies to identify ways to improve the safety 
and efficiency of the nation's Transit Systems. Safety is FTA's number 
one priority, and FTA is working across the nation to improve the 
safety of both transit riders and transit personnel by a focus on 
reducing assaults and other safety incidents on transit.
    To help ensure the continued safety of our nation's public transit 
systems, in 2021, FTA launched the Enhanced Transit Safety and Crime 
Prevention Initiative to provide information and resources to help 
transit agencies address and prevent crime on their systems and protect 
transit workers and riders. These resources also can be used for 
overtime pay for enhanced security personnel presence and mental health 
and crisis intervention specialists. FTA also funds training for 
operators and instructional staff, including courses on ``Assault 
Awareness and Prevention'' and ``Violence in the Transit Workplace--
Prevention, Response and Recovery''. These courses provide transit bus 
operators with prevention strategies necessary to reduce the likelihood 
of assault incidents and knowledge and skills to prevent, respond to, 
and recover from workplace violence.
    Additionally, BIL provisions will enhance safety by strengthening 
rail inspection practices, protecting transit workers and riders from 
assault and injury, improving safety training, and instituting measures 
to reduce vehicular and pedestrian crashes involving buses. 
Additionally, Urbanized Area Formula recipients will certify that 
agency safety plans are consistent with Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and state health authority guidelines to minimize exposure 
to infectious disease. FTA is taking actions to communicate and 
implement these requirements.
    FTA works closely with all of its grantees to ensure the proper use 
of funds through regular technical assistance, oversight, and a 
comprehensive Triennial Review process. FTA is also conducting advanced 
reviews of COVID-19 supplemental funding grant awards to identify where 
strengthened documentation or procedures are needed. Proper oversight 
coupled with improved safety will continue to inspire confidence in 
transit.

    Question 2. In communities where the fossil fuel industry has a 
significant presence and they are a major economic driver, the shift 
away from fossil fuels could be catastrophic to the workforce and the 
tax base if we do not prepare for it. However, research has shown that 
fossil fuel communities would be prime locations for alternative fuel 
production such as solar or wind energy. Given the undeniable 
connection between the transportation sector and the use of fossil 
fuels, how are you coordinating across the various federal agencies to 
promote these new forms of energy generation while continuing to set up 
fossil fuel communities to prosper? I'm aware of and supportive of the 
Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and 
Economic Revitalization--how is that group taking action, and what 
other efforts is the Department undertaking?
    Answer. DOT is actively participating in the Interagency Working 
Group's (IWG) place-based forums with fossil fuel communities around 
the nation, helping them to identify prospective DOT grants that may 
fit their situations. One such community where a major coal power plant 
is closing (Lincoln County in Wyoming) recently won a $1,790,000 RAISE 
grant to upgrade its freight rail system, provide EV charging stations, 
and improve rural public transit.

    Question 3. How can we make sure that investments we are making in 
alternative fuel infrastructure, like electric vehicle charging 
stations, are placed to maximize efficiency of the system in 
coordination with the private sector, including taking into 
consideration the reduction of traditional pollutants and greenhouse 
gas emissions?
    Answer. The electric vehicle (EV) charging provisions in BIL will 
help tackle the climate crisis and put us on a path to a nationwide 
network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030 that ensures a convenient, 
reliable, affordable, and equitable charging experience for all users. 
DOT encourages States to develop programs with cost-share requirements 
or rebates to leverage private investment in EV charging and maximize 
the impact of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) 
Formula Program funding. States were encouraged to involve relevant 
private sector and industry representatives throughout the development 
and deployment of their NEVI State EV Infrastructure Deployment Plans 
to allow for the identification of EV charging market opportunities and 
challenges, along with potential solutions to address them. As is 
discussed in the NEVI Formula Program guidance, funds made available 
under the program may be used to contract with a private entity for 
acquisition, installation, and operation and maintenance of publicly 
accessible EV charging infrastructure (FHWA anticipates that this will 
be done in most cases) and the private entity may pay the non-federal 
share of the cost of a project funded.
    The NEVI Program will support the Justice40 Initiative, which 
establishes a goal that at least 40 percent of the overall benefits of 
federal investments in climate and clean energy infrastructure are 
distributed to disadvantaged communities. Consistent with the Justice40 
Interim Guidance, DOT and the Department of Energy (DOE) developed a 
joint interim definition of disadvantaged communities for the NEVI 
Formula Program. The joint interim definition uses publicly available 
data sets that capture vulnerable populations, health, transportation 
access and burden, energy burden, fossil dependence, resilience, and 
environmental and climate hazards.

Questions from Hon. Salud O. Carbajal to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary 
          of Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. Recently, the U.S. Census Bureau changed the 
methodology for defining an urban area. As a result, more than 1,300 
small cities, towns, and villages designated as urban will now be 
considered rural--despite not having a significant population change. 
This includes portions of my district in San Luis Obispo County, where 
they have seen increased population over the past decade. The San Luis 
Obispo Council of Governments (SLOCOG) estimates that the County will 
lose two of three small urbanized areas, which receive about $3.5 
million every year in federal transit dollars to help its residents 
connect with services and jobs. What resources are available for 
communities that are expected to go through this transition? How is the 
Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) working with communities, 
like San Luis Obispo, to ensure there isn't a loss in transportation 
services available to these communities?
    Answer. FTA expects the U.S. Census Bureau to provide updated 
urbanized area boundaries in late 2022, which will be used to inform FY 
2024 apportionments. After the Census Bureau identifies the new 
boundaries, FTA will provide technical assistance to all areas with a 
change in population significant enough to affect their designation 
within the rural or urban formula programs that may impact their 
funding levels or the mechanism by which they receive federal funding.
    A small urban area that believes it will shift from small urban to 
rural should begin to have discussions with the state department of 
transportation to determine how funds will be provided to them 
beginning in FY 2024 as rural transit funding is administered through 
the States and territories. FY 2023 and prior year funds that remain 
unobligated or undisbursed may continue to be used by agencies under 
their prior designation, which can support their transition.

Questions from Hon. Sharice Davids to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of 
           Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to Secretary 
Buttigieg for taking the time to join us today. It's always a pleasure 
to hear from a fellow self-proclaimed infrastructure nerd.
    I'd also like to sincerely thank you for taking the time to visit 
the Kansas Third District earlier this year to participate in a 
roundtable with local stakeholders, as well as participating in an 
adventurous electric bus tour of US-69, before taking me up on my 
invitation to enjoy some of Kansas City's best BBQ at Slap's. I WOULD 
ask you if my tour was as satisfying as the BBQ, but I think I know the 
answer so I won't ask!
    My question revolves around the sort of outreach we experienced at 
that roundtable, actually. I have released four reports so far 
highlighting the infrastructure needs our district faces: highways, 
bridges, water, and safety.
    In each of those reports, I demonstrate how laws like the American 
Rescue Plan and the IIJA will direct needed resources to address these 
issues, at home, in Kansas. I also point out specific projects that 
involve roads, bridges, and systems people use every day--and how IIJA 
will help improve them. One of the most interesting reactions to these 
reports is from some of my constituents who didn't realize how bad the 
need was or what a state of disrepair our bridges were in.
    Secretary, as you continue implementation of the IIJA and make sure 
that this money is being dispensed judiciously, it's important people 
also know how and why these projects are occurring.
    Question 1.a. Can you comment on USDOT's role in making sure folks 
not only know projects are being brought to them by the bipartisan 
infrastructure law, but that they know precisely how that money is 
being utilized to make their day-to-day experience with infrastructure 
better?
    Answer. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) provides 
generational investments in our nation's infrastructure. The Department 
is committed to keeping the public involved and up to date on how these 
historic investments will improve day-to-day life for the travelling 
public. FHWA has published a customer friendly, public facing ``One-
stop shop'' BIL implementation website that houses useful information 
for stakeholders--including guidance, fact sheets, and webinars--with a 
special emphasis on impacts to safety, equity, sustainability, and the 
workforce. The Department also established the DOT Navigator website to 
help local communities plan for and deliver transformative 
infrastructure projects and services. The Department is working 
diligently to release additional BIL funding opportunities and 
information to keep the public apprised of our progress and will 
continue to do so.
    Additionally, the Administration created the website www.build.gov. 
The website provides information for state, local, tribal, and 
territorial leaders to help them with IIJA implementation. Further, it 
is a roadmap that shows funding available under the law, as well as an 
explanatory document that provides program-by-program information.

    Question 1.b. How do you see the role of state DOTs and MPOs in 
fully implementing IIJA in the long term? Can you speak a little to the 
relationship US DOT needs to have with those local organizations to 
make this all work?
    Thanks again for your time today. I am excited to continue working 
with you on a transportation and infrastructure bill that moves our 
country forward!
    Answer. State DOTs and MPOs are essential partners in the 
successful and full implementation of BIL. While states and MPOs are 
eligible for both discretionary and formula funding, their roles in 
guiding local decision making is crucial to providing optimal 
transportation infrastructure as efficiently as possible. The 
Department must have a strong, trusting relationship with these local 
organizations since they are the front line in working with communities 
across the nation on the necessary planning, implementation and 
oversight required for BIL to be successful.
    BIL creates more opportunities for local governments and other non-
traditional entities to access funding. The Department is committed to 
supporting these entities in delivering transformative infrastructure 
projects and services through training and technical assistance 
programs tailored to the unique needs of local communities. FHWA 
provides training and technical assistance for local and rural road 
agencies through the Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP) and for 
Tribal communities through the Tribal Technical Assistance Program 
(TTAP). DOT also continues to fund technical assistance resources that 
directly support State DOTs and MPOs through our FHWA Resource Center, 
the Build America Center, and the Every Day Counts initiative, to name 
just a few. Additionally, the Department's Rural Opportunities to Use 
Transportation for Economic Success (ROUTES) Program addresses 
disparities in rural transportation infrastructure by developing user-
friendly tools and information to connect these communities to DOT 
funding and technical assistance resources. The new Thriving 
Communities Program is specifically designed to provide tailored 
technical assistance to local communities to assist them in developing 
and delivering infrastructure projects, including pre-application 
support. The Department also recently launched the DOT Navigator 
website to make it easier for local entities and all our stakeholders 
including state DOTs and MPOs to access the help they need in both 
competing for funding opportunities and project delivery.

 Questions from Hon. Nikema Williams to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary 
          of Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. Some of the Department of Transportation's federal 
programs are intended for transportation alternatives--such as transit 
or bike and pedestrian pathways--but their funds can be transferred to 
other federal highway programs that support road and bridge projects.
    Secretary Buttigieg, how can the Department of Transportation 
encourage or incentivize state and local governments to make 
investments and prioritize projects that mitigate congestion and 
encourage a shift to more climate-friendly transportation modes?
    Answer. In order to meet our Departmental goals and support the 
Administration's priorities, our transportation system needs options 
for reliable, affordable, and accessible public transportation and 
active transportation options that are safe for all users. The 
Department is working with state, local, and Tribal governments through 
program guidance and technical assistance to support a safe, equitable, 
and sustainable transportation system that works for all users.

    Question 2. Secretary Buttigieg, the recently launched Reconnecting 
Communities Pilot Program is a program that is near and dear to me. The 
1956 Federal Aid Highway Act built highways through the middle of 
cities, at times to intentionally displace Black families. This left 
economic devastation that still exists. Two examples of these 
disenfranchising projects are in Georgia's Fifth District: the Sweet 
Auburn and Summerhill communities were both divided by the construction 
of the Downtown Connector and I-20. There is a direct line between the 
decision on where to build the highway and today's racial wealth gap. 
The Reconnecting Communities Pilot Program is a long overdue matter of 
racial justice. Secretary Buttigieg, how does the Department of 
Transportation plan to highlight this new program and what ways will 
the Department work to assist and educate local and state governments 
with applying?
    Answer. DOT has undertaken an extensive array of activities to 
assist and educate eligible applicants, including local and state 
governments, applying to the Reconnecting Communities Pilot (RCP) 
Program. Early on, we established the Reconnecting Communities Pilot 
Program's digital presence with a tri-lingual webpage 
www.transportation.gov/reconnecting available in Spanish and Mandarin, 
and used press, webinars, social media, and email listservs across DOT 
and at sister federal agencies to generate awareness of the program. 
There are now over 11,000 subscribers to the Reconnecting Communities 
listserv, which provides updates on additional guidance, FAQs, and 
webinars. DOT has hosted a number of informational and training 
bilingual webinars with over 11,000 attendees, covering topics 
determined by expressions of interest from the public. Public webinars 
were designed deliberately to facilitate two-way communication and 
transparency by allowing open chat and informal poll questions for 
insight into applicant challenges and technical assistance needs. A 
dedicated email account, staff contact phone number, and DOT regional 
and field staff provide individualized support for prospective 
applicants.
    Under Reconnecting Communities' technical assistance, DOT can use 
up to $30 million over five years for technical assistance. DOT will be 
using to stand up a learning institute that will include support for 
prospective program applicants and program grantees and serve as a two-
way channel to provide information back to DOT senior officials on 
challenges encountered by state and local governments in implementation 
of the program.

Questions from Hon. Troy A. Carter to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of 
           Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation

    Question 1. Mr. Secretary, can you provide additional details on 
what actions US DOT has taken to incorporate the goals of the Justice40 
initiative into IIJA program implementation?
    Answer. Justice40 is an opportunity to address gaps in 
transportation infrastructure and public services by working toward the 
goal that many of our grants, programs, and initiatives allocate at 
least 40 percent of the overall benefits from federal investments to 
disadvantaged communities. It is not a one-time investment, but a 
series of changes that will be implemented across the Department. 
Through Justice40, DOT will work to increase affordable transportation 
options that connect Americans to good-paying jobs, fight climate 
change, and improve access to resources and quality of life in 
communities in every state and territory in the country. The initiative 
allows DOT to identify and prioritize projects that benefit rural, 
suburban, Tribal, and urban communities facing barriers to affordable, 
equitable, reliable, and safe transportation. DOT will also assess the 
negative impacts of transportation projects and systems on 
disadvantaged communities and will consider if local community leaders 
have been consulted in a meaningful way during the project's 
development.
    DOT has designated 39 covered programs, representing $204 billion 
in DOT funding, as Justice40 covered programs and is currently 
developing corresponding benefit metrics for each.

    Question 2. Mr. Secretary, does the Department have the capacity to 
provide technical assistance to small municipalities that desperately 
need infrastructure improvements but may not have the capacity to put 
together the application to compete for grants? If not, what sorts of 
legislation would be appropriate to provide you with those resources?
    Answer. Through the new Thriving Communities program, funded in the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, DOT can now help disadvantaged 
and underserved communities with certain grant pre-application needs. 
Though still under development, we are designing the program 
specifically to include assistance with application development and to 
undertake some of the required studies and analysis necessary to 
receive transportation construction grants. It is especially 
challenging for small, rural and Tribal communities to conduct 
financial, environmental, and transportation analytics typically 
required by Congress as a condition of funding. Therefore, the 
authorization and consistent funding as requested in the President's FY 
23 budget request for the Thriving Communities program would enable DOT 
to reach many more communities to provide this type of support and 
technical assistance. Furthermore, as the program launches in early 
2023 it is being coordinated with other federal place-based technical 
assistance programs to maximize impact especially for smaller under-
resourced communities. This includes improved collaboration between 
federal field and regional staff to support communities in identifying 
and preparing to apply for Federal funding as part of a Thriving 
Communities network.
    In our outreach to small and disadvantaged communities in urban, 
suburban, rural, and Tribal areas, we hear repeatedly the challenges 
these communities face in meeting federal match requirements, 
developing federal grant applications, and in completing multiple 
applications for the same project that may be eligible for more than 
one discretionary grant program. Specifically, these small and 
disadvantaged communities often cannot find adequate funding to meet 
the statutory match requirements for discretionary grant programs, 
which typically require 10-20 percent match. Because of this 
significant financial challenge, they may be unable to apply for DOT 
discretionary grants, despite having a legitimate transportation need.
    Considering these challenges, DOT has developed resources to help 
communities navigate non-federal match requirements and the grant 
process. However, given the myriad of statutory inconsistencies across 
programs, communities still find it difficult to navigate the local 
match requirement while also ensuring that the specific program to 
which they are applying allows their type of matching funds. 
Furthermore, despite the Department's efforts to try and consolidate 
programs, where possible, into a single Notice of Funding Opportunity 
(NOFO) (as with the Multimodal Projects Discretionary Grant program), 
the distinctions between programs still make this a challenge.

    Question 3. Mr. Secretary, as you know, the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act includes a competitive grant program to 
reconnect communities. These highways often plunged through Black 
communities and communities of color. In fact, several neighborhoods in 
Louisiana's Second Congressional District, including New Orleans' Treme 
neighborhood are included in that number and would directly benefit 
from this grant. The historic Treme neighborhood, which was 
dramatically bisected by I-10 in the 1960's was once a thriving 
predominantly Black business corridor. What are you and the Department 
doing to engage communities, especially minority and historically 
disadvantaged communities that were disconnected by highways, to ensure 
that their desires and input are at the forefront of righting this 
wrong and reconnecting these communities?
    Answer. This is top of mind for DOT. DOT's implementation of the 
Reconnecting Communities Pilot (RCP) Program includes several 
provisions to ensure that historically disadvantaged communities have a 
leading role in shaping projects that would be carried out in their 
communities, as specified in the NOFO: ``The primary goal of the RCP 
Program is to reconnect communities harmed by transportation 
infrastructure, through community-supported planning activities and 
capital construction projects that are championed by those 
communities''. DOT will evaluate all applications with RCP Program's 
four merit criteria, each of which ensure that the desire and input of 
disadvantaged communities are placed at the forefront.
      With Merit Criterion #1: Equity, Environmental Justice, 
and Community Engagement--DOT will rate applications for the existence 
of harmful policies, existing disparities, environmental burdens, needs 
of the surrounding community, with special consideration for those most 
affected by the highway or other transportation facility, meaningful 
engagement of hard-to-access community members, and robust mitigation 
planning for any adverse impacts.
      With Merit Criterion #2: Mobility and Community 
Connectivity--DOT will rate applications on demonstration of existing 
barriers to access, mobility, and economic development, and whether the 
proposal connects community members, including those with disabilities, 
to daily destinations through affordable transportation options.
      With Merit Criterion #3: Community-based Stewardship, 
Management, and Partnerships, DOT will evaluate whether the applicant 
takes a community-centered approach that meaningfully redresses 
inequities and benefits economically disadvantaged communities, with 
partnerships with entities with ties to communities adjacent to the 
highway or other transportation facility, and use of a community 
advisory group or board.
      Finally, with Merit Criterion #4: Equitable Development 
and Shared Prosperity--DOT will rate applications on demonstration of 
comprehensive community vision planning that redresses inequities and 
barriers to opportunity through community restoration and anti-
displacement strategies, creative place-making celebrating local 
history, local inclusive economic development and entrepreneurship of 
disadvantaged businesses, and the adoption of local hiring preferences.

    Furthermore, in 2023, we will be using up to $30 million in 
technical assistance funds provided through the Reconnecting 
Communities Pilot Program to stand up a learning institute that will 
include engagement with disadvantaged communities over the next five 
years to enhance their capacity to plan and deliver solutions that 
reconnect communities. This institute will also serve as a two-way 
channel to provide information back to DOT senior officials on what 
challenges are being encountered by communities.

    Question 4. Mr. Secretary, one of the most exciting projects in my 
district and the state of Louisiana is the high speed rail that would 
connect Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Do you have an update on when this 
project will be completed or how the project is going?
    Answer. The Department is excited by the potential of the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's (BIL) historic investment to help 
advance passenger rail projects. The state of Louisiana's leadership 
should be commended on their dedication to support and engage in 
projects of this nature.
    In April 2022, FRA, along with Amtrak and various state of 
Louisiana officials, participated in Canadian Pacific's (CP) inspection 
trip of KCS' line between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Recently, DOT 
announced FY 2022 RAISE program award selections. DOT selected the City 
of Gonzales, LA's application, which was submitted in partnership with 
the City of Baton Rouge, LA, for a $20 million award for the `Downtown 
Baton Rouge and Gonzales Train Stations Project'. Additionally, an FRA 
CRISI grant to the Southern Rail Commission will fund the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) environmental review for the corridor 
and stations.

    Question 5. Resilience of our transportation assets to worsening 
climate change is a clear priority in the IIJA. And we now have both 
competitive and formula PROTECT programs to invest in resiliency-
enhancing projects. What is your Department doing to assess the costs 
and consequences of climate change for our transportation system? And 
will you be issuing guidance and providing technical assistance to 
state agencies as they develop plans and programs for climate 
resilience including as part of their PROTECT program investments?
    Answer. The new Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, 
Efficient, and Cost-saving Transportation (PROTECT) program, 
established by BIL, provides formula and discretionary grant funding 
for resilience improvements. In July 2022, FHWA announced new guidance 
and $7.3 billion in Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, 
Efficient, and Cost-Saving Transportation (PROTECT) formula funding to 
help states and communities better prepare for and respond to extreme 
weather events like wildfires, flooding, and extreme heat. The new 
PROTECT formula program funding is available to states over five years 
to make transportation infrastructure more resilient to future weather 
events and other natural disasters by focusing on resilience planning, 
making resilience improvements to existing transportation assets and 
evacuation routes, and addressing at-risk highway infrastructure. 
PROTECT builds on other DOT actions to address the climate crisis that 
support the Biden Administration's whole-of-government approach to 
reducing greenhouse gas pollution by 2030.
    The Department is working with states and cities to ensure they 
understand the risks of climate change and are planning for future 
climate impacts and the long-term resilience of their communities. For 
example, we have helped our state and local partners explore the best 
ways to conduct vulnerability assessments. In particular, the Federal 
Highway Administration (FHWA) has developed and refined an adaptation 
framework to help agencies identify vulnerabilities and solutions. The 
framework provides information on a range of applications, from small 
qualitative studies to complex, quantitatively driven analyses, and 
from the State or regional systems level analysis down to corridor- or 
project-specific analyses. In addition, FHWA has developed and 
continues to refine a range of procedures, tools, and guidance 
documents to help transportation agencies address climate change when 
designing roads, bridges, culverts, and drainage infrastructure. These 
resources include:
      Highways in the River Environment: Floodplains, Extreme 
Events, Risk, and Resilience (Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 17, 
2nd Edition). This guidance document presents detailed technical 
guidance and methods for assessing the vulnerability of transportation 
infrastructure to extreme flood events in riverine environments. It 
includes information about downscaling climate data for use in 
hydraulic engineering.
      Highways in the Coastal Environment (Hydraulic 
Engineering Circular No. 25, 3rd Edition). This document presents tools 
for the planning, design, and operation of highways in the coastal 
environment, focusing on roads near the coast that are influenced by 
coastal tides and waves constantly, or occasionally during storms. A 
primary goal is the integration of coastal engineering principles and 
practices in the planning and design of these roads and bridges to make 
them more resilient.
      Nature-Based Solutions for Coastal Highway Resilience: An 
Implementation Guide. This document summarizes the current literature 
on the benefits and costs of nature-based solutions. From there it 
follows the steps in the transportation project delivery process, 
providing information on planning, site assessment, design, permitting, 
construction, monitoring, maintenance, and adaptive management of 
nature-based solutions in the transportation context.
